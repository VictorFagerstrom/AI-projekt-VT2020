When I was like 14-15 (2 yrs ago) I was super horny and had lots of money saved up from birthday/Christmas and a few jobs here and there, so one day I ordered one of those giant sex doll ass things off Amazon. They were on amazon prime so I ordered it on a Friday and then woke up super early on Saturday to retrieve the package before my family got up. It looked something like [this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0828/3109/products/Pipedream_Fuck_Me_Silly_Mega_Masturbator_Angle_View_right.jpg?v=1539623179) So anyways I fucked the shit out of the thing like every other day, until I got lazy and stopped cleaning it. I had nowhere to hide it so I kept it in the giant cardboard box that it came in, and stored it in the back corner of my closet, with a giant ass blanket over it. Eventually I stopped using it so I sealed it shut with some tapeNow fast forward like 1 year ago my mom goes into my room when I�m out of the house, and cleans out my entire closet because she was tired of it being so messy. She finds the box but doesn�t open it, she said to me that I should use a knife to cut the box up into small pieces, and put it into the recycling bin for garbage day. I said �okay okay� but never actually got around to doing it because i knew that I needed to keep the box in order to hide the sex toy. Eventually she got really mad with me and said if I don�t do it by next week, she�s going to do it herself while I�m at school. So naturally i start panicking. I decided that I needed to get rid of the sex toy first before I got rid of the box. So when my mom and my sister left to go to Hollywood for shopping, I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and began attempting to cut the sex toy up into small pieces. The thing smelt vile and foul, so I actually needed to use my dads gas mask he had in the garage to even be able to breathe properly (for people who don�t know, the thing had a large amount of rotten cum, and spit used as lube all stuck in the fuck canals, and it was left there for MONTHS). Eventually I got everything cut up and evenly distributed the pieces into large black plastic garbage bags. By this time, my dad had gotten back from work, and my mom and sister were back. So I could not properly dispose of the sex toy pieces.This thing was pretty big so I had like 3 bags full of the cut up pieces. I decided that my best bet at disposing of the bags without anyone noticing, was to get up early in the morning, around 2-3 AM, and go out and search for a dumpster to dispose of the bags. So I decided to do just that. Each garbage bag was just big enough to fit inside my school backpack, so i needed to make 3 trips, there and back. See I live in a very populated part of Southern California, so even late at night, there were still people out, meaning I couldn�t really just leave the bag somewhere random and risk someone opening it and being disgusted by me, so I needed to find and travel to 3 separate dumpsters.I set out on my bike (I couldn�t drive I was 16) at 2:45 AM with the first bag in my backpack and found a dumpster behind a mini plaza that was closed for the night. It was relatively close to my neighbour hood so I got rid of the first bag pretty easy. The second one, not so much. And the third bag I found myself biking almost across the city (and I basically lived in Los Angeles, so there were LOTS of people still on the street, and lots of hills) just to find a discrete area/dumpster to use. Eventually I finished my 3 there and back trips from my house all the way out to some random dumpster at 3 AM. I was absolutely exhausted, but was relieved at the fact that I no longer had to worry about my mom finding the sex toy. Went through all of that trouble just for a few half decent nuts. By far the stupidest thing I�ve ever done as a kid/teen

Hey, everyone! Thank you for reading mine and Nicky�s little story in all its parts. This *will* be the last part, which I know I said before, but this time I mean it. Unless something huge happens, I probably won�t have enough material to write a fourth part, haha. In any case, I hope you enjoy this one! Oh and small note: There are bits of dialogue in this that are mostly strung together based on journal entries that I wrote at the time, a  certain someone's input, and whatever we remember. So, we left off in my senior year of high school. It was 2007. Chris Brown was still a good guy in public eye, Britney Spears and K-Fed had recently split, Michael Jackson was still alive, and my high school boyfriend and I had reached a massive fork in the road. We were accepted into two different universities on opposite sides of the country. He was moving to the other side while I was staying close to home. The good news? We were accepted into our first picks. The bad news? Our relationship was toast.  We decided we would enjoy whatever time we had left together, and then go our separate ways. I wasn�t very keen on long distance as I wanted to focus more on my studies than making sure my boyfriend wasn�t cheating on me. Dean agreed. We were exactly on the same page in that regard. When time came around for us to say our goodbyes, I made sure to let him know he was as close to perfect as I had ever met. Not only was he patient, supportive and trusting, he was all of those things and so effortlessly understanding at the same time. Of course we had our moments, but it was all worth it. I can safely say I was the lucky one in our relationship. I�ve heard so many horror stories of crazy, manipulative boyfriends but Dean wasn�t like that at all. He was good. So a couple of months into university, when I heard he was dating another girl at his school, I wasn�t at all surprised. Dean was a charmer. Of course there was another girl lol. She was cute. I had only a few pictures to go off of on social media, but yeah. She very cute, very bubbly looking, and exactly the type of girl I had always imagined for Dean. In other words I was happy for them. I mean, don�t get me wrong, I had my jealous moments � but I was mostly happy for them. The fact that I was suddenly thrust into university and forced to make new friends at school, helped to distract me from those tiny, unwelcome sparks of jealousy. I eventually wasn�t jealous anymore, and I eventually met this girl when Dean brought her home for Christmas. Our tight knit group of friends from high school had all met up at one of our houses the day before Christmas Eve. Dean politely introduced his girlfriend to me, and we got on really well. She was a nice person. Still is, as a matter of fact. (They�re married now and pregnant with their first child. Crazy, huh?)The next night, when I was with my family and a bunch of our relatives at my parents� Christmas Eve party, I realized how much I missed home. School wasn�t too far away. Maybe two hours on a particularly busy day. But during those first few months, I tried my best not to go home and fall into old, comfortable habits. I wanted to grow up and separate myself from my family a little bit. That said, I absolutely cried when I saw them again. Such a cornball lol. My brother made fun of me for *years* over that. In fact he still does. He�s kind of an asshole like that, but in a good way.Suffice to say I stuffed my face and immediately fell into food coma. It was close to midnight, I would say. I dragged myself into my old bedroom, where everything had been left the same since the last time I was there. The murmur of music and laughter down below kept me somewhat alert of my surroundings. I knew it wouldn�t be long before my mother or father came knocking to see if I wanted some extra dessert or something, so I told myself I would rest for only a few minutes. The second I flopped down in bed and sunk into the comfy mattress I been deprived of at school (seriously, the mattress in my dorm was like a slab of concrete) I felt my pocket vibrate.I groaned into my pillow, lazily retrieving the flip phone from my pocket to find a text message. *From: Nicky**Merry Christmas* However tired I felt, I smiled when I saw the message. There were times when we would go months without speaking, and times when we would speak nearly everyday. No matter how long we had gone without talking, we�d always pick up exactly where we left off as though no time had passed. He was going to school in the same city as me. But, for some reason, we had yet to hang out. We tried a few times in the beginning, organizing lunch or coffee somewhere in the city, but the plan would always change. We�d run into scheduling problems or papers that were due. For the most part, he was the one to cancel on me. I figured he wanted to focus on school and his new friends, which was totally cool with me as I was trying to do the same, but it kind hurt in this weird way. That in mind, I had no idea how to respond to his text. Truthfully I wanted to call him and catch up, figure out what he had been up to since September, but I resisted the urge and instead sent a very short, very prompt, �*You, too*�. A few seconds later, he texted me again. *From: Nicky**Do you have time to talk?* I wasn�t sure what to make of that, so I just stared at it for a moment or two, wondering if he was serious. For those past four months, he had canceled on me a total of twelve times. I had no idea what he could possibly have wanted to talk about, yet the curious part of my brain simply refused to subside until I said *Yes*. In no time at all, he called and I answered. I figured there would be a moment of preamble but there wasn�t. He went straight for the jugular. The conversation went something like this:�Hey, <insert name>, sorry for catching you at such a weird time, I just �� �You just?� �I � miss hanging out.� �(raises eyebrow) You miss �hanging out�?�� � With you. I miss you.� �Oh.� �Yeah � Sorry for saying that out of nowhere. I�ll go. You�re probably busy and �� �Wait, no. I miss you, too.� �You do?� �Of course. I�ve been trying to see you for months, smartass.�  �(laughs) Right, yeah. Sorry for cancelling so much.� �It�s okay. We�re not kids anymore. We can�t just hang out whenever we want, I guess.�  �What about now?� �You want to hang out now?� �Yeah. If I floor it I can probably make it over there in twenty minutes.� �(hesitates) Your family wouldn't be upset if you ditched them on Christmas Eve?� �I have feeling they�d encourage me to see you.� �Um � Okay, cool. Take your time and be safe, though. Don�t floor it. The roads are crazy.��I�ll try not to.�In a matter of seconds I was up, pacing my bedroom. I would cast a look on the window now and then to see if he had arrived, but there were no headlights and no sign of him on the road ahead. I figured the roads were covered in snow, slowing him down a lot, and then I began to worry that he *had* actually floored it and landed himself in an accident. For a hot second I contemplated calling his mother to check when he had left relative to how much time had gone by. The moment I grabbed my phone to do so, I felt it vibrate in the palm of my hand. In about two seconds, I grabbed my coat and snuck out of the house undetected, leaving a tiny trail of footprints in the snow as I hopped over to the beat-up Honda Civic parked along the curb. To my great relief he had cranked the heat up, bringing a flush of warmth to my cheeks as I climbed inside. He looked much the same as the last time we had seen each other. Except now he was dressed for winter instead of summer. The fact that we hadn�t hung out since August had really begun to sink in. There was a moment of silence after I climbed in, a moment wherein eye contact was scarce and the faint hum of �How Soon is Now?� by The Smiths was playing in the background. Nicky was a big fan of them. I fell into the quiet of the song before darting a look at him, asking: �So, how have you been?�He told me he was doing well. He told me film school was better than he thought it would be and that he was learning a lot in his classes. I was happy for him. When we were kids we always used to re-enact scenes from our favourite television shows (Power Rangers, Ninja Turtles, etc.) and I distinctly remember calling him bossy a few times. Had I known his passion was to be a director, I would have encouraged the bossiness a little more and given him the Oscar performance he had always demanded of me, haha. Needless to say I was very proud of him. Once we covered the basics (school, part-time jobs, our nonexistent lovelives, friends and family, etc.) we reached a roadblock. Figuratively. There was nothing else to say, no words to fill in those wide stretches of silence. I remember glancing up ahead at my parents� house. The Christmas lights were on and the blinds were open, revealing the tree my mother had decorated weeks prior and the various silhouette of all the party guests. They were all in the living room, laughing and drinking, having a good time. Soon enough he darted a look in my direction and uttered the inevitable: �You should go inside. Your parents are probably wondering where you are.� He was right. There was a party going on and yet, I didn�t care. I hesitated a moment, eventually asking: �Do you want to come in for a bit?�I could see the flicker of surprise in his eyes and the debate that soon followed. Without saying anything, he followed me out of the car and through the front door of the house. I kicked off my winter boots and bobbed my head around the corner to make sure one of my nosy relatives weren�t looking, before leading the way. We tiptoed up the stairs and into my room, the bed covers still ruffled from when I had collapsed on top of them after dinner. I took my coat off and hung it up, back facing Nicky as he hovered quietly by the door. We left it open an inch or two, just enough that we could hear it if someone approached. There was really no reason to be so covert and sneaky. My family liked Nicky. In fact my mother had asked me to invite him to the party anyway, but I told her, he was probably busy with his own family. Yet there he was, in my room. To my memory it was his first time up there. The few times he had come to my house when we were kids, my parents made us play in living room or in the backyard where they could keep an eye on us. We weren�t allowed to go up to the second floor of the house alone. In a matter of seconds he was studying his new surroundings. The colour of the walls, the photos tacked onto the bulletin board, the books lined neatly along the shelf, *everything*. The moment he spotted Twilight in my collection, he chuckled.I tried to play it off like one of my friends bought it for me, but damn it, I was into that series and I�m no longer ashamed to admit it, lmao. Shortly thereafter the atmosphere grew less tense. In that time he texted his mother and told her he was going to hang out at my house for a bit longer. She had apparently started dating, and her boyfriend�s two teenaged kids were at the house, too, as well as Angela and her fiancee. So their house wasn�t completely empty without Nicky. I was very happy for his mother. She deserved a good man in her life, and according to her son, the new guy was very nice. We eventually went downstairs together, as there was no point in hiding up in my bedroom like a couple of high schoolers. I introduced him to a few of my relatives. They, of course, mistook him for my boyfriend at first, but I immediately corrected them. My parents greeted him warmly, and my brother shook his hand, offering a drink. For obvious reasons Nicky declined. First, because he was still underage. Second, because he had driven there and the roads were bad enough. We hung out in the main room for a bit, and then we slipped into the kitchen to munch on some snacks and indulge in some nonalcoholic beverages. Well � Nicky went nonalcoholic. I, on the other hand, went straight for the wine. One glass. Nothing crazy. It was a lot quieter in the kitchen, and there was a nice view through the window. Even though it was cold and snowing outside, we decided to go out onto the back porch and (both literally and figuratively) chill out there for a few minutes. Again, it was a lot quieter. The music and laughter from the party had almost completely escaped our senses as we closed the door behind us, sitting down on the porch swing side-by-side. I won�t lie to you guys. There was some tension, an undercurrent that we had both ignored for a very long time. Perhaps that was the reason he had cancelled on me so often, because maybe he was trying to avoid what was so plainly obvious. He had that right. Yes, we shared an intense history, and for that reason, we understood each other on a level that other people couldn�t but we had already talked through the painful memories of our past, so what the fuck? Why couldn�t we just be friends? Why was it always so complicated? Yes, it had occurred to me that maybe there were some feelings there. I had no idea if they were romantic, I just knew we couldn�t move forward in our friendship without addressing them. The timing could have been better, but I had no idea when the next time would be so I just went for it. Luckily I had a glassful of liquid courage at my disposal. �Nicky, do you like me?� �Of course.� �No, not that way. I mean, do you *like-like* me?� �(bursts out laughing) What the fuck. Are you serious?� �(embarrassed) Uh, okay. You don�t have to be a dick about it. I was just asking.��(laughs) Sorry. I didn�t mean to be dick.��Whatever. If you don�t *like-like* me then why have you been avoiding me?��Well, first of all, I never said no to *like-liking* you.� �So, you do *like-like* me?��Do you want me to *like-like* you?��Is that your backwards way of asking if I *like-like* you?��I don�t know. Do you?��I don�t know.�It was a whole lot of that, and a whole lot of dancing around the truth before I decided *fuck it*, and kissed him. First on the cheek and then on the lips when he turned his head. It wasn�t a super intense, movie kiss, mind you lol. It was pretty awkward to be honest. I didn�t know where to put my hands or how long I should kiss him for and he was just as befuddled. That said, it was a nice kiss. I liked it, and judging by the fact that he kissed me again almost immediately after I pulled away, I�m pretty sure he liked it, too lol. Naturally there was a layer of reluctance. With regards to intimacy, he�s always had his troubles and I�ve always had mine, and it wasn�t always easy working through those troubles. So, yes, to all the people who�ve been asking, *we are in a relationship*. Haha. I had initially set out to include this in Part 2 of the story, but I guess I thought people wouldn�t believe me? Let�s be real. Our story is pretty crazy even without all of this. Basically, we kissed a lot that night and toyed with the idea of being together, but we ultimately decided it was wiser to take some time to live a little and enjoy university. So, that�s what we did. We went to different parties, dated other people, took part in study abroad programs (him in London and me in Seoul) and then, when those four years were up, we did exactly as I mentioned earlier. We picked up exactly where we left off. Insane, right?

I made a comment in r/TheMonkeysPaw treating it as a writing prompt. Many supportive redditors encouraged me to write more, so the following is a short story about the following comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMonkeysPaw/comments/afwruc/i\_wish\_everyone\_had\_a\_counter\_above\_their\_head/ee210er/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMonkeysPaw/comments/afwruc/i_wish_everyone_had_a_counter_above_their_head/ee210er/?context=3)&#x200B;\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* �Avery! Get out of bed! You�re gonna miss the bus!� My mom�s voice rang throughout my room. I get up and let out a loud groan. All I can think about is how terribly I remedied my sleep schedule coming out of the summer break, I�m tired as hell. I rush to get all my school gear in my bag and quickly eat through my breakfast. �How about you enjoy your food, bud?� my dad said, glaring over his newspaper. �Sorry dad,� I say, muffled by the sound of food in my mouth. I grab the last piece of toast of my plate and make a run for the door. I clumsily put on my shoes and my mom tackle-hugs me before I get out the door.�I can�t believe it�s your last year of high school already! Oh, how the time flies,� mom says, clearly holding back the tears only a mother could cry about her son growing up. �I�ll be fine mom,� I say in response, hoping mostly for her to finally let me go. �Love you, honey,� She says, letting me go. �Love you too mom,� I say as I rush out the door. �Way to keep me waiting, dickhead.� �Fuck off, Berk,� I say. Berk is a good friend of mine, him and I always walk to the bus together. We are always insulting each other, you know, like good friends do. I don�t care though, we are always having laughs, and we know we don�t really mean what we say when we�re fucking with each other. We arrive at the bus stop.�You fucking ready for the first day back? We�re gonna fucking kill it this year I swear.� Berk says. �Yeah, we�re always the cool ones aren�t we bud?� I retort. �Shit�s gonna be different this year bud, we gotta get into the cool parties and shit man, we gotta score some babes. For fucks sakes, we�re both 18 and can�t even score,��How fucking peculiar that me and my baby face and you with your thin legs aren�t pussy magnets,� I say, with a laugh and a smirk. �Fuck off! You�re the one with a swimsuit profile pic on PopPics!� Berk says through a laugh. I look across the street to see an old lady, and as I look to my left, I see the bus coming. �Here it comes, ready?� I say to Berk. �Fuck yeah boy!� he responds. The bus fucking passes us! Berk and I start chasing the bus, screaming for it to stop. I see the old lady in the front of the bus. The bus wheels start screeching as I get near the front of the bus. Something comes over me, adrenaline maybe, and I pull the old lady out of the way of the bus.�Are you ok?� I ask.�Just fine, thank you so much, you handsome young man,� she says.She walks off. �Nice fucking save bud, that was fucking awesome!� Berk shouts.�Let�s just get on the bus,� I say.The school day goes on like any other. Associating with friends, starting classes. Why do people put so much hype into going up a grade? Shit doesn�t really change that much, the classes just get harder. The people stay the same, not like all of the sudden everything�s different. The day passes, I get off the bus, say goodbye to Berk, and go back into my house. Dinner is just like any other nuclear family dinner, filled with �How was your day��s and the like, as I scarf down some spaghetti and meatballs. I chill for the rest of the night and then 11:00 hits. The parents are upstairs in bed and it�s time to do what any normal teen does. Spank the fucking monkey.I log on to my favorite camgirl site, putting in my famous username; dick\_tugger69. Just as I start choking the chicken a bright light fills my room. Oh fuck, is it my mom?! I start panicking.�Oh Jesus Christ what the fuck dude oh my fuck!� says a voice.The voice sounds familiar. As the light dims I see a floating figure in my room. This is...odd. �Excuse me, what the fuck are you?� I ask.�I am an angel, one that wishes he had the power to unsee what he just saw.� the thing says. �Your good deed today has earned you the respect of the spiritual beings beyond this Earth. For that I���Hold the fucking phone what the hell!� I interrupt. �You can�t just drop the bomb that angels fucking exist in the middle of nowhere just cause I saved an old lady from a bus! What the hell! This is fucking insane! I�m only human you can�t just surprise me with all this information and expect���ENOUGH!� The figure yells. �I�m here to grant you one wish, as you have earned it, you have 1 minute to think.�Oh fuck what do I want. Jesus all this, all at once? This is insane what am I supposed to wish for? All of the sudden, an urge hits me. I see my favorite camgirl on my screen, and I think about how many other dudes have bust a fat nut to this chick. I think about my new profile pic on PopPics. Has anyone ever done the same for me?�5...4...3�� the angel counts down.�I want a counter above everyone�s head that displays how many times they�ve been masturbated to!� I say.�Wh-what?� The angel asks, incredibly confused. I can�t back down now. �You heard me! Grant my wish!� I say, staring directly that this weird angel dude. �Alright, it�s your funeral bud,� he says. �Wait what do you mean��He disappears. What did he mean? Is there something wrong with wanting to know how many people find me attractive enough to get off to? Wait, he still had to grant the wish! I run to the mirror in my bathroom nearby. There it is, the counter. 2. I can�t help but feel a little proud about that. 2 is good right? I put away the porn, this ego-boost will help me sleep like a fucking baby tonight.I wake up bright and early the next morning. I go downstairs. My mom and dad are at the table. Mom has a 3,650 above her head, dad has a 2,893. I can�t help but be disturbed at the fact that my parents masturbate to each other, the thought can�t leave my head, ew ew ew. I shudder.�What�s wrong honey? The numbers confusing you too?� Mom asks.�U-uh, y-yeah mom. What are these anyway?� I respond with. She cannot know about this. �They just appeared this morning when your mother and I woke up. How odd. Check the news Avery, everyone�s confused,� my dad says.Oh fuck, everyone has these numbers, and no one knows what they could mean! I turn on the news. The reporter goes on about a mass confusion all across the world. No one�s packing and destroying buildings, but people are just so scared about what the numbers could mean. I check the time, and it looks like I have to go. I head outside and see Berk, with a fat 3 above his head. More than me? Really?�How�s it going 2?� Berk says as I walk down my driveway.�Not much 3, the fucks going on?� I inquire. �No fucking idea bud, all I know is that my number is higher than yours so fuck you bud!� Berk laughs as he starts clapping, more for himself rather than for his joke. I can tell Berk feels better about himself with that number above his head. Berk and I head to the bus stop as per routine and board. The numbers are everywhere, some overlapping each other. I see a couple in the triple digits. Berk and I get off the bus, and I�m greeted by the sight of people standing in a circle. I see their numbers, 10, 4, 6, 8, and so on. Confused, I push through the people to the center. I see a kid. I don�t know his name, Berk and I just call him �the quiet kid�. He has a 0 above his head. Poor sap. He shouts �STOP!� as he tries to crawl out of the circle. A kid with a 7 hits him. I�m immediately appalled. They must think they�re better than him cause of the numbers.�Fuck off guys, the numbers aren�t that fucking important!� I shout.�Oh yeah, you fucking 2?� says 10, moving in on me. �What do they fucking mean, huh, pussy?� �They mean...uh...they..uhhhh,� I manage to get out. They�re not gonna fucking believe me. Imagine trying to tell a bunch of high schoolers that an angel gave me a wish and I asked to know how many people bust a nut to everyone. I should�ve asked to be the only one to see it. I should have chosen my words so carefully. Or maybe I shouldn't have asked for something so stupid. Jesus Christ why the fuck did I wish this?In my awkward silence during my realization, I�m punched. I start feeling more punches and more kicks. Fuck, it hurts and all I can do is crawl up in a ball. Barely keeping my eyes open I see the principal break up the fight. The school nurse comes out to get me, and I see a 123,678 above her head. What a bunch of fucking pervs I go to school with. The school nurse? Really? The nurse sends me home early. Surprisingly, nothing is broken. Guess I�m just getting on the bus and heading home. I limp home, bruised and beaten, sit on the couch, and turn on the TV. �Breaking news! Strikes and revolts have broken out across the world! Workers are calling for low numbered bosses to be removed from companies! The governments of the United Kingdom, Peru, China, Mongolia and more have fallen to high numbers!�Holy fuck. Live footage of a protest is being displayed. A man with a 2 stands in front of several people with 4 or 5 digits shouting �More than just a number!� The other small numbers join in the chant. The high numbers begin marching, and all of the sudden, charging. I can�t stand to look. They�re being trampled, Jesus Christ! I turn off the TV.My phone goes off, the president has declared a state of emergency. No one is allowed to leave their homes until the meaning behind the numbers is discovered. I can�t help but check the news, my curiosity is killing me. I wish it didn�t. All I can see is death. I have no words. All I can do is cry. I ruined this world, for what?Soon after, my mom walks through the door. I wipe away my tears and put on a happier face.�Oh my god, what happened to you?!� My mom asks, immediately crying. I decide to be honest with her.�The kids started beating me up because my number was smaller than theirs,� I say.�Oh my god, oh my god, here, let�s get you some ice,� my mom says, clearly flustered.She�s pacing all around the house. It�s a little heartwarming to see her so worried about her son, but it�s hard to replace the thoughts of what I�ve done to this world. I make it through dinner and through my dad trying to teach me how to fight. My muscles are sore, but that doesn�t stop dick\_tugger69 from logging in. I need some relief anyway.Just as I�m having a �staff meeting�, my camgirls counter goes up. Someone in the chat starts typing. �Yo wtf I just nut and her number went up?�Her number goes up again. It keeps going up. The chat starts going crazy.�Why are the numbers related to my nuts?��What the fuck dude? Does this mean the numbers are about how much we masturbate to people?��It has to be! Look at her number! 34,510,952!�I quickly took a screenshot of the chat. I sent the picture to my local news agency and told them that we may have found out what they mean. Hoping for the best, I called it a night and went to sleep.The next morning I rushed to the TV to turn on the news, and lo and behold the truth was revealed. I listened to the reporter and was filled with a relief so great it was like lifting an elephant off my shoulders. I go outside, meet up with Berk, and get on the bus. Berk and I sat quietly on the bus, both too awkward to discuss the nature of our numbers, when suddenly the bus comes to a screeching halt.�What the fuck is going on?� I uttered.�Protests,� The bus driver says.I ask to be let off, and the bus driver opens the back doors. I see a huge group of people outside Hawthorne Elementary. They�re chanting �Close the windows, put up bars, before their numbers climb to Mars,� What a peculiar chant, why would they need to worry about the numbers...of...children��..oh fuck. Pedophiles! Fucking pedophiles! I can�t believe I forgot about fucking pedophiles! I�m standing in shock, I can�t believe that people out here are sick enough to masturbate to children at an elementary school. Horrified, I continue my walk to school. Nothing�s changed. People are still obsessed with these fucking numbers. Protests everywhere. Everyone�s still using the numbers for a superiority complex. Why the fuck is everyone so vain? The narcissism is boundless. People need to stop being so obsessed with themselves, it�s gonna bring our society down. My phone buzzes again, another national alert. I roll my eyes and check my phone.I regret everything. I�m immediately filled with a feeling I have never once felt before. The grief, the guilt, all of these negative feelings immediately bring me down to my knees. I have to check the news, I need to know how many people are involved. Maybe I�m dreaming. I try to shout for someone to pinch me but I can�t make any noise. All I can do is let the tears roll down my face. I�m a killer.It wasn�t a dream, it was a nightmare. People with low numbers were killing themselves by the thousands. I can�t help but feel entirely responsible for their deaths. They�re associating not turning people on online with their self-value, but why? It has nothing to do with being �ugly� or being �hot�, it�s all about being yourself. I keep trying to convince myself this. It was true before the numbers, at least I hope so. I don�t really know what to think of the world anymore. I boiled everyone down to numbers, and as a result, that�s all the base each other off of. At least my favorite camgirl might be president soon. Who am I kidding what kind of bullshit silver lining is that? Honestly, I just have to live with fucking this world over.The angel was wrong. It�s not my funeral. It�s everyone else�s, and that might be worse. I wish the consequences only affected me but in the grand scheme of things I�ve ruined upwards of 8 billion lives and or what? Curiosity? Vanity? I don�t even remember what spawned my urge to make that wish anymore, I just wish I never made it.I guess I have to go to school.



******************************



First of all, big thank you to everyone who took the time out of their day to read the original post. This one isn�t as sad, I promise you! The beginning takes place in my senior year of high school. My life had changed a lot. The town where I lived was no longer so densely homogeneous. There were people of all different ethnic and social backgrounds. Particularly in the high school I went to. It was a co-ed private school. I had to wear a uniform and everything. Because my brother had gone to the same school previously, and because he had been incredibly popular amongst his peers, I was given a bit of a head start on the social ladder � so to speak. In other words, I wasn�t a loner anymore. I had friends and I was deeply involved in extracurricular. To the point that *boys* actually *liked* me, which was so foreign a concept I almost couldn�t wrap my head around it. My parents were rather strict with me, though, and didn�t let me leave the house until I had done my homework, finished my share of the household chores, etc. In the nine years that had gone by since the first part of this story, my cousins and older brother had moved out of the house. Most were in university or living alone, working at this point. I was the youngest and the only one left. The house was empty now. Just my parents and I. As a kid, I had always dreamt of living in a quieter, less crowded atmosphere but I quite missed all the ruckus. It was fun � in hindsight. In any case, because I was *rarely* given permission to go out, particularly at night when there were parties and things, I decided I should bring the party to me. There was this boy in my high school, Dean, who for some reason liked me a lot. He�d flirt with me in the hallways, in class, and wherever else. There were times when I wound find him by my locker with a funny story to tell, his backpack slung on one shoulder and music from his earbuds filling the negative space between us as we spoke, eventually walking home together. For lack of better words, he was hot. On the rare occasion that I was allowed to go out, I would always drag a friend or two with Dean and I on our �dates�. He would bring his friends, too, and we would eventually ditch them so we could run off somewhere and make out. For whatever reason, though, we were never official. He had never really asked, and to be honest, I wasn�t interested in having a boyfriend anyway. I was so focused on school and extracurricular, I had no time for a relationship, and neither did he. We were comfortable just *having fun* together. Either way he eventually expressed interest in taking our fun to the next level. By that I of course mean *sex*. He wanted to have sex with me. Being seventeen, I had never gone that far before. I wasn�t really sure if I wanted to the first time he mentioned it, but the more I thought about it � and the more we made out, I thought *why not*. We both lived our parents, so choosing a time and a place was rather difficult. Being the absolute gentleman that he was, he suggested his car, but I kindly declined and instead told him he should come to my house with me after school. My parents were both workaholics, so I was home alone a lot. There was no way anyone would catch us. As long as Dean parked his car a couple blocks down and quietly followed me inside, everything would be fine. One day, that�s exactly what happened. He snuck into my house after school. I brought him up to my room and we started kissing on my bed, rather hard might I add. Before I knew it, he was on top of me, tugging at my clothes, and I was under him, blushing fiercely. I didn�t want him to see me naked in broad daylight, so I asked if he would close the curtains and blinds, and he promptly did. When he was back on top of me, I shrugged out of my shirt and I let him see parts of me uncovered for the first time. It was going smoothly in my mind. There was nothing that could go wrong. He was being gentle, patient, and I was very much into it � until he said it. He pulled back a few inches and whispered, �You�re so *pretty*, <insert name>.� As with the other times anyone had ever called me pretty since third grade � be it a classmate, a relative, or a lady at a clothing store � I froze. I hated being called pretty. It wasn�t that common of an occurrence, mind you, but when it did happen, my entire body would turn rigid and I would hear that word in a man�s voice. A grown man with a polaroid camera in his hands and a look in his eyes that I can only describe as *hungry* � *calculated*. Being that we had only just gotten to know each other, Dean had no idea why I didn�t like the word pretty. He figured I was just a little insecure and had to be reminded of how cute he thought I was. I obviously didn�t want to tell him the real reason out of fear that it would scare him away. He was a nice person, but he was also just a normal, teenaged boy who, to my knowledge, lived happily inside his white-picket-fence bubble. I envied him because of it. Still, he felt me turn rigid, and he apologized. We took a moment to collect our breath, and then I just � I don�t know � I pushed those memories to the back of my mind, and I followed through with what I had set out to do that afternoon. I lost my virginity to Dean. And that was that. I half expected him to ignore me at school the next day, but he didn�t. He put his arm around me, loosely so I didn�t feel trapped, and guided me to his and his friends� lunch table. Everything was cool. I was beginning to like him more and more, and we eventually made it official. I decided it was time I introduce him to my family, so I brought him home and explained to my parents that Dean and I were dating. They were slightly taken aback, but they welcomed him all the same.My parents were aways massive hockey fans, so they were pleasantly surprised when I told them Dean was on our school�s hockey team. He was very good, and I had gone to a few of his games here and there to watch him play. Eventually, I went over to Dean�s house to meet *his* family. It was my first time and I was very nervous. I knew they were good people for having raised such a nice boy, but I couldn�t help but worry a little. What if they didn�t like me? What if they thought I wasn�t good enough? The usual blend of thoughts in a meet-the-parents type of situation, I would think. In any case they took to me fairly quickly. He had a mother, a father, an older sister, and a younger brother, and they were very nice people. For whatever reason, though, Dean�s younger brother went to a different school than us. He was a freshman at one of the public schools in the next city over. Apparently his grades weren�t up to par, but I call bullshit. The school system screwed him over. He was a smart kid, very smart. In fact he�s currently enrolled in McGill, which is basically Canadian Ivy League. Anyway, I eventually added Dean�s brother and sister on Facebook, because that was the norm at the time. People kind of just added anyone, no matter how distant of a connection. It was a fairly new thing back then, too. 2007. As far as I know, only university students had it before that, so to us it was very cool and the people with the highest friend count were *obviously* the coolest lol. I want to say maybe like, two or three weeks later, I came home from school and did the usual. I hopped on msn and chatted with friends while listening to music and studying. I had a mid-term, I think. One that I was totally and utterly unprepared for. Because of that, I slowly focused all my energy on studying, quietly ignoring the messages my friends were sending in our group chat. Oddly enough, I still remember the song I was listening to when it happened. I took a break from the books, absentmindedly clicking at random on my computer, when I saw a notification in the window where I had Facebook open and running. I clicked on it, expecting an app notification to one of those annoying games everyone used to play, but I soon came to realize my suspicions were wrong. It wasn�t an app notification. It was a friend request from a boy named Nicky. For a second I couldn�t believe it, I sort of just froze and stared at his name as though it would morph into something else, but it didn�t. The letters stayed exactly as they were and I dragged the cursor over the �accept� button, hovering in thought for no more than a couple of seconds before I rapidly clicked on it.I accepted the friend request, and dove into his profile. The comments on his wall, the apps, the people in his friends list, and eventually, the photos, too. I spent a good three hours creeping his profile, to the point that it was dark outside when I finally stopped. I came to realize he went to the same school as Dean�s little brother. The one in the next city over. They were apparently on the debate team together, and � from what I had gathered in my innocent snooping � Nicky had seen one of the funny comments I had left on one of Dean�s brother�s pictures, recognized my name, and added me. It was a silly picture. Something from Halloween if I remember correctly. I remember thinking a few things while viewing the pictures in Nicky�s profile. First, his hair was different. Slightly darker but still blond. Second, he was a lot taller. Very close to six feet if not all the way there. Third, he was the spitting image of his father. I felt a lump in my throat, one that didn�t really go away until my mother called me down to have dinner. Within an instant my parents could tell something was up. They didn�t ask, they just knew. Still, I tried my best to act normal and stuff my face the way I usually did. Once dinner was done, I took our empty dishes to the sink and washed them by hand, the way I did every evening. The whole time I was thinking about Nicky, the way he looked so happy in his pictures, and the fact that he had added me out of nowhere. Truthfully I had considered searching him up on Facebook many a time, but I had never followed through. In part, because I was afraid he wouldn�t remember me � and in part, because he had very clearly severed ties with me before moving. I had no idea if he even wanted to hear from me. The fact that *he* had added *me*, however, had put an end to those worries. I went upstairs after, slipping into my bedroom with the lights off, and plopped down on my desk chair. This time there was a **message** from him. �Hey, <insert name>, I don't know if you remember me, but I used to hijack your pudding cups when we were kids.� I covered my mouth, laughing. I couldn�t believe he remembered. The fucking pudding cups lmao! It was hilarious and cute and so, so unexpected. I quickly typed a response. Something to the effect of, �You�re lucky I don�t charge interest,� and we immediately fell into conversation with each other. We must have been messaging back and forth for hours. Well into the night. Apparently, he and his family had moved to the other side of the country when we were kids, but they were back on this side now. His mother went to culinary school and landed a job at once of the fancy restaurants in the city downtown. She was sous chef. And his sister, Angela, was in her last year of university, majoring in Psychology. Nicky, on the other hand, was still in high school like me. Model student. Debate team. Part-time movie ticket tearer. He also had a car � a beat-up Honda Civic that he adored. It seemed they were all doing very well, and I was so, so happy to hear that. For years I thought of them, asking myself where they were, what happened, if they were okay. It was nice to know they *were* okay. More than okay, in fact. They were happy. Over the course of the next few days, we exchanged phone number and began texting each other, *a lot*. It got to the point where my friends were beginning to notice. I was always on my phone, more than usual. Whenever they asked, I said I was texting Dean. I don�t know why I said that, I just did. I couldn�t very well tell them the truth, could I? *Oh, um, I�m texting this guy who was coerced into doing horrible things with me when we were children*. Yeah, no. Not happening. I knew dropping Dean�s name was the quickest way to get my friends off my case, so I did. But, Dean eventually took notice. I mean, I wasn�t on my phone *that much*. He was just extra observant. One day, while we were driving somewhere in his car, he openly asked me who I was texting and I opened my mouth to give him some bullshit excuse but I eventually decided not to. Dean was good to me, and it was time he knew the truth. I told him everything. Every little thing. From the innocent beginning to the numbing end, to where I was then. He listened very carefully, to every last detail, and then he asked, �So that guy was your first kiss?� I couldn�t decide whether I was hurt or confused by that question. I had just spent the past twenty or so minutes telling him one of my deepest, darkest secrets, and his only takeaway was the kiss. The kiss Nicky and I had been forced into by his sick, twisted father. I *sort of* understood where Dean was coming from. In his mind, he thought *he* was my first kiss. The first boy who had kissed me on the lips, the first boy who had intimately touched me � all of that. He still was the first in my mind, but, being a boy of seventeen, he didn�t see it that way. He wasn�t angry, just a little shocked, I think. And also, he had actually *seen* Nicky in person a few times, during his little brother�s debate team matches (or whatever they�re called). For whatever reason he also mentioned that his sister thought Nicky was cute, as if trying to coax me into saying I thought Nicky was cute, too. It was a pathetic attempt on his part, which I 100% ignored, because *what the fuck*.I seriously, *seriously* considered breaking up with him after that, but I decided against it. As difficult as it was for me to tell him what happened, it was also immensely difficult for him, my boyfriend, to digest this new side to me that he never knew existed. We gave each other the benefit of the doubt, and I later assured him there was nothing romantic going on between Nicky and I. For one, we had only *just* started speaking again, and on top of that, there was a very clear line between us. Maybe if things had panned out differently when we were kids, we would eventually have developed romantic feelings or at least toyed with the idea, but the possibility of that was completely 100% never going to happen now. In fact the thought had never even crossed my mind until Dean had mentioned it. Once the night was over and I was in my room again, I decided to minimize communication with Nicky. It was nice to get back in touch with him but I couldn�t have an old friendship permeating into my new relationship. Plus, it was rude of me to be texting him all the time. I explained this to him and he understood without question. We wished each other a good night and spent the next few weeks toning it down, *a lot*. It got to the point that I began to wonder if I�d said something wrong, if I could have phrased it better when I told him we should take it easy. To go from nearly a decade without any word, to talking all the time, to suddenly not talking again, was kind of � well, it scared me to be honest. I didn�t want to lose Nicky again. Whether I wanted to admit it or not, he played an important part in my life, and I, him. We had avoided the topic for quite some time, choosing only to discuss fun, happy things, but the day he asked to see me in person, I knew why. It was March.The temperature outside was still frigid, wintry. I asked my mother if I could borrow the car for a few hours, and she of course asked why. On the rare occasion I was given the car, it was only to run errands like picking up eggs or milk from the grocery store when my parents were too busy. At this point, my mother had no idea that Nicky and I had reconnected. I wasn�t keeping it from her on purpose. I just couldn�t fathom where to start, how to broach the topic of Nicky without upsetting my mother in some way. She wasn�t upset with him, just � the details that surrounded him. His name, his old house, the cul-de-sac where he used to live. Being that she was my mother, it was just as hard on her as it was on me, what happened. That said, I wasn�t ready to tell her. Not yet. The only person I told was Dean, and he was surprisingly supportive of it. I ended up taking the train to the meeting spot Nicky had suggested, and I eventually saw his car pull up. The beat-up Civic he loved so much. To be honest, I was kind of nervous. I didn�t know what to expect, how to act. The last time we had seen each other was *nine* years ago. Nearly a decade. So much time had gone by, so many things had changed. Yes, we were the best of friends in third grade, but the guy I was meeting now was practically a stranger. When he climbed out of his car and saw me, however, the nervous knot in my stomach quickly unraveled and we met in the middle, laughing through the initial awkwardness like a pair of dorks. I won�t bullshit you. It wasn�t as breezy as you would think. It was very, *very* awkward lol. We walked around a bit, grabbed coffee at the nearby Starbucks, and filled the long gaps of silence with random bursts of nervous laughter and sentences that broke off into the quiet. We must have spent an hour doing just that, until finally, Nicky asked if I wanted to take a drive. It was pretty cold outside, so I agreed. We climbed into his car, him in the drivers seat and me in the front passenger seat beside him. He powered the engine and pulled out of the parking space with ease. It didn�t surprise me, the fact that he was such a good driver. He had always been good at things, especially things I found difficult, and I was a shitty driver through and through lol. Finally we got into the swing of things. We discussed games, the latest episode of Lost (because that was a thing back then) and many more nerdy interests that we both shared. The conversation eventually shifted to a different topic. Nicky asked about Dean. He knew I had a boyfriend, specifically the older brother of his fellow debate team member. I had mentioned my relationship here and there, but I wasn�t really the type to go on and on about it. Still, he asked so I answered, and we then got into the topic of his love life. Turns out he had never dated anyone. It wasn�t for lack of options, I was sure. He was just busy, devoted to school and what not. That part didn�t really surprise me. Nicky had never really mentioned any girls to me before, so I kind of figured he was flying solo. Over the course of the next hour, we drove all the way back to our old stomping grounds. I could tell by the look on his face that he hadn�t been back since he left all those years ago. He was so surprised by all the changes. The new houses that had gone up, the old businesses that had been torn down to make room for new ones. I couldn�t tell whether he was happy or sad, I just went along with it. He eventually turned into the cul-de-sac where he used to live, slowly approaching his old house. Surprisingly it was still up. There was a new family living in it. Going by the playhouse outside, they had a young child. Nicky stopped a few houses down, carefully pulling his keys from the ignition after.It was pretty dark out. Cold, dark, slightly windy. I figured there would be a moment, a second where we could gather our thoughts and figure out what to say, how to say it � but he just blurted out the first words that came to mind. �I�m so sorry.� He apologized to me. He opened his mouth and apologized, as though he felt what happened was *his* fault. I couldn�t believe he spent all these years blaming himself for something he couldn�t control, a situation wherein he was just as much, if not more of a victim than me. I told him right away that he had nothing to apologize for. I knew somewhat that, that was part of the reason he�d severed ties with me before moving. He felt ashamed, embarrassed that it was his own *father*. I told him over and over again that it wasn�t his fault. But he wouldn�t budge. He said something along the lines of, �It was my house, you were my friend, and he was my dad.� I was tearing up at this point. It literally broke my heart that he said that, that he felt that way. He was in no way at fault. Not by any stretch of the imagination. The only one at fault was the adult in the situation. Yes, that man was his father by blood, but that was it. That�s where the relation started and ended. They had nothing in common beyond that and a few physical similarities. Slowly but surely, he started tearing up, too. He said, �We were supposed to be each other�s safe zone and I put you in danger by bringing you to him.� He said those exact words. I had no idea what to say anymore, how to communicate the fact that I�ve only ever missed him. Truthfully, he was hurt. I could see it in his face and hear it in his voice. He was deeply hurt, and there was nothing I could do but lend an ear. Suddenly I saw traces of that eight-year-old boy, the one who couldn�t look me in the eyes when we were alone in that basement with his father. We talked for a long time in his car, the old house in view. Once everything had been said, he drove me home, pulling up to the curb of my house in silence. I wasn�t sure if we were good, if he would ever speak to me again after this, so I took the chance to tell him something I had kept quiet until then. I told him I still had the photo and that if he wanted it, he could have it � but he would have to hang out with me again. He seemed surprised by this. Surprised and mildly amused now that I remember. Suffice to say he *did* hang out with me again. In fact we hung out pretty steadily that year. My friends from school all liked him, Dean liked him, and my family was thrilled to have him back. Particularly my mother. It�s been ten years since then, nearly twenty since we met in elementary school, and Nicky is still a very important person in my life. More important than you would think. (Edit: Nicky really wants me to continue the story. What do you guys think?) *Okay, guys, I did it. I wrote another [Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/50yi2d/prettier_pt_3/)haha. Last one!*

So I was in 8th or 9th (about 13 or 14) and my ex's sister had a really big crush on me. And I kinda liked her too. Well we're in a Skype call and she's all like "Hey I want to watch my little pony but I'm scared I'll be made fun of" and I'm like I'll watch it with you. Fuck it. And she's like aww that's sweet I'll make it up to you. I'll show you my boobs. And blah blah. So we watched *THE FUCKING ENTIRE FRIENDSHIP IS MAGICAL SERIES 6 HOUR YOUTUBE VIDEO* and the video ends and I'm like sweet can you uh. And she's like "gotta go to sleep" never did get to see the tits. Kinda still bummed about.

So the two kids that live in the dorm next door to me CONSTANTLY throw parties at insane hours and wake up my roommate and I and tons of other kids in my hall, and early today at FOUR in the morning they decided to start a party. They put their music on louder than they ever had before and it was SO unbelievably loud. Additionally, they were all talking and yelling so loudly that it woke me up when i was having a really really good sleep. So naturally I was pretty pissed off and I tried coming up with a solution. Here�s what I came up with;I took my REALLY loud bluetooth speaker that I never use (out of courtesy, the walls here are paper thin) and I went on the Google Translate English audio option and typed in �M****** COLLEGE ALERT SYSTEM: ATTENTION H******** HALL ROOM NUMBER 212, THE (insert my hometown) POLICE DEPARTMENT ARE ON THEIR WAY TO YOUR DORMITORY FOLLOWING REPORTS OF INAPPROPRIATE NOISE LEVELS AND SMELL OF MARIJUANA. BE QUIET AND DO NOT LEAVE OR ELSE YOU WILL BE ARRESTED AND EXPELLED. WE HAVE YOU ON CAMERA.�I held my speaker out of my window and closer to their window, which was also wide open, and I played it at full volume... I had never heard so much hushed panic and so much alcohol being poured and bottles being thrown out of a window before in my life. I didn�t think it would be believable, but the reverberation of the courtyard that my room overlooks made it sound like the speaker was further away, and their inebriated minds totally bought it. These kids were absolutely BUGGING. I could barely make out what they were saying as it was quiet and super chaotic, but it sounded like a scene out of Animal House being played at minimum volume. For the rest of the night, I did not hear even a PEEP from their room. Nobody talking, nobody leaving, no music playing. I had one of the most satisfying sleeps of my life.

So this takes place back in high school, long time ago. I was in class and I wasn't feeling too good that day. I wish I was kidding, I really do but I'm not. I have a bowel disorder with the intestines, not gonna get into that. But I was in class, didn't shit for about a week and a half if I remember correctly. I had to take a shit. Really fucking bad. My stomach was aching so bad. I would NEVER shit at someones house, or at school.Except for that day. I thought to myself "Fuck it, I'll take a shit in the bathroom. It's gonna be the biggest shit anyone has seen, but most likely they'll have no idea who it was. So I asked the teacher to use the bathroom, took a hall pass and was on my way. I get into that bathroom, nobody was in it a the time (thank god) and immediately run to the stall, close it, lock it, drop my pants and sit on the toilet. About 5-7 seconds later, there it goes. It was thirty seconds of pushing, one came out, and then another one. I could smell the defecation as soon as it hit the water in the toilet, and it was awful. This wasn't going to flush, there's no way. But then a student walked in. My heart sank from my chest all the way to my ballsack probably.I was genuinely terrified. The student walked right in. He said "oh god what the fuck is that" he took a piss, and left as quick as possible. I sat on the toilet for the next few minutes. My stomach was aching, but I also felt relief. No, I didn't flush it. Didn't even try, I knew it would clog. I didn't want anyone to suspect it was me in even the slightest. I eventually left the bathroom, and walked back to class. I was in there for a bit, so the teacher said I was late on the way back. With some quick thinking I tell her "I'm sorry miss, Won't lie to you, my friends walked in and we got caught up in silly conversation" She replies to me "Well, at least you're telling the truth, I appreciate that. But you're behind on work" I went back to my desk, finished my stuff. At the end of the day, nobody had an idea who it was that took this giant shit in the toilet and left it there.I went home that day, did things a teenager does at home after school, usual shenanigans. Took a piss, video games, half-assed my homework, busted a nut all that stuff. Went back to school the next day. My first thought is "I'm going to that bathroom to see if that shit is still there, if the janitors did anything about it. So I walked in, and that entire stall had a sign that read "out of order" the toilet was closed up and everything.   I was dying of laughter, it was absolutely hilarious. I tried so hard to contain my laughter which I did. I thought it was fucking hysterical coming back the next day and seeing that same toilet out of order the next day. It stayed like that for maybe another month. And to this very day, nobody had any idea who did it. This was definitely one of my weirdest, but also funniest HS experiences I've ever had.

When I was young I met a boy who I will call Zachary, who is 2 years older than me. Zachary was a stereotypical bully, nowhere near Biff from Back to the future and nowhere near that kid in the black shirt in phibias and Ferb, but somewhere in between. But he was still ruthless. He likes to pick on you, call you names and exploit your worst fears, and if he gets bored he likes to start conflicts between best friends by using fake evidence, he seldom shows his good side. But whenever the kids come crying to the teachers Zach uses his charm and manipulation to make the kid look like the perpetrator and he is the victim and he wins every single time. This is because Zach is the student head of year, and the captain of the soccer, swimming and running team. He bullies me because he sees me as an �easy target� Here are some of the things he did to me:* when he found out I was terrified of bees he managed to install a giant bee farm in the school garden and yours truly was �chosen� to be the main beekeeper* he manipulated one of my friends to think that I hate him (complicated)* he framed one of my best friends for having alcohol on his possession* in a Halloween costume party, I came as a werewolf superhero and he �accsidently� set my cape on fireThen came that fateful day. My geography class went on a trip going whitewater rafting (can't say where (fear this will give away my location)) and I was in a raft with 4 of my friends and I was sitting in the back with Zach, who ignored me as he was under watch by 3 teachers.I can't fully remember everything that happened before the accident. Just bright sun, lots of water, and me screaming my lungs out. Then suddenly we went over a giant rock that ripped our raft into shreds in an instant. One moment I was sitting in an uncomfortable position, the next I was thrown like crazy in the rapids. Then pain on my head. Then everything was black.I woke up regurgitating water from my chest (I don't know how to explain the experience but wet) and Zach standing over me with a look of relief on his face. It turned out when the raft got ripped up, I hit my head on a large rock that knocked me out, and it nearly sent me to the bottom of the rapids that would have been my grave if Zack hadn't seen me and immediately dive down to rescue me.Zack, a guy who nearly burnt me and made me face my worst nightmare had saved my life.I owe him an unpayable Dept, and after he saved my life Zach changed almost like a flip of a dime and he apologized to everyone about what he did. I forgave him and we have been friends ever since.

I saw a meme and it reminded me. When my gf and I were like 15 I accidentally shoved my gf to the ground cause I was running and bumped into her and didn�t see where I was going. It sounded like she fell hard so I frantically apologized and she wouldn�t move. After a while of me awkwardly standing there I go to turn her around and she�s unconscious. I try to feel her pulse but because of her chest I couldn�t detect a beat. I was convinced I had inadvertently killed her and I started bawling. I held her in my arms all dramatic like and I cried for a solid minute till she started laughing hysterically. Like cackling. It turns out she was pretending to be unconscious the whole time. We laugh about it now and she said it was sweet how I cried over her but at the time tho I felt really dumb. Learned my lesson

it�s first grade and my mom walks me to class and wishes me the best. i get settled in and meet my teacher. i don�t remember her name but i do remember she was a large very nice black lady. probably in her late 30s.Then after kid after another come this one kid comes in. his name was strange but i don�t fully remember it. i think is was �madaddo� or �Matado� it was very weird and he had very short hair. while the teacher is calling role. i see him in the back holding scissors and playing with the blade. then she gets to his name and mispronounced it. the kid started to scream bloody murder and puts the scissors to the top of his head and starts stabbing the top of his head over and over. kids stared to cry and the teacher sent us to another class. That scream and seeing him stabbing his head still haunts me to this day. i don�t know what ever happened to him. all over a unique name.

When I was very young, maybe 4 or 5, I had died and was brought back to life. I was born 10 weeks premature with a pretty long list of medical complications. One day as a small child my parents recalled me screaming. Crying would be an understatement. They described it as if they heard a full grown adult in total agony. I was quickly taken to the hospital where I was met with my local emergency staff. I had recently received a surgery for acid reflux and after tests were ran they found just about every organ in my body was failing or had failed leading to my heart and lungs. They believed it to be an infection caused by the earlier surgery. What I believe now to be sepsis. They offered my parents a pretty grim outcome behind two options. Either they give me medication to clear the infection or they open me back up and wash my insides in order to fight the infection. At it's severity the latter option was chosen and I went under the knife. I explain it as popping my batteries out and back in again. They flushed the infection away to the best of their abilities. I died on that operating table. I was pronounced dead in some sort of mixup with my surgeons counting to attempt to revive me. After incredible work from the surgeons they brought me back. I know I'm petty young but I suppose there wasn't much internet communication in the 90s as my time of death was not removed from the paperwork. My parents received a death certificate for me soon after but luckily I'm still around. I'm not too sure where it is anymore. I'm sure my mother keeps it with my birth certificate somewhere. Either way I'm grateful for the surgical staff and have a cool story to share.

Ok, so i've had hearing problems since i was about 6-7 years old. When i turned 14, i got hearing aids. I got BTE hearing aids (behind the ear) and just recently i got in-canal hearing aids. So, these kinda look like the galaxy bud things that Samsung released. Once i got them, i was a lot less conscious of them. So, when i went to school with them on, nobody really seemed to notice.During 2nd period, i put my hair up cause my art class was using acrylic paints. So, this kid who was walking past me to refill his water cup, stopped, looked at me and tapped me on the shoulder."You know, those aren't *real* airpods, right?". Me, obviously confused, took a second to process what he just said. "These are hearing aids. I kinda need them to, you know, *hear*". He was embarrassed. He just kinda... slowly walked away i guess. I'm not really sure how to put it.

	"I died in 2021. I lived a decent life. At least, I think I did. I was born February 19th, 1995. I lived in Georgia. We had a small house in an old town in the middle of nowhere. My parents ran a small convenience store that brought in just enough money to pay the bills. I had a brother and a sister.	"In school, I didn't make many friends. I was awkward and quiet. Some of teachers recognized my last name, since my brother was in their classes before I was. I was always teased, so I ended up taking it out on my little sister. I made fun of her, and a couple times she even cried.	"I loved my parents but sometimes I was a brat to them. Times like when other kids were getting cars and licenses, but my parents didn't have the money. I remember saying that they weren't doing it because they didn't care about me. And I made snide comments for a couple weeks after that.	"I never went to college. Instead, I got a job as a grocery store assistant manager. My parents were pretty upset that I didn't go to college, but even more upset that I didn't carry on their business.	"My brother was in a car accident when I was 17 and my sister and I grew apart. I stayed in Georgia with my comfortable job, while she moved away, got a degree, and became some kind of designer. Interior Decoration, mom said.	"I did meet a girl when I was 22. She was pretty. And she was nice, I guess. But mainly pretty. She and I were together for a while. Then I found out that she was pregnant. The kid was mine, but I wasn't ready to be a parent. I stopped seeing her, but I did send her child support every month.	"My parents passed away and their shop was torn down. They built some fast food place on the lot to replace it. My sister didn't come to the funeral and only a few people showed to grieve.	"I developed a bad cough shortly after the funeral. My breathing started to get short and strained. My chest was constantly stinging. They found out that the chemicals in my vape were damaging my lungs. Eventually, I died. And now, I'm here."				"Do you know where you are?"	"I'm assuming this is heaven? Or purgatory... I'm being judged, right?"				"You are being judged, yes. But this isn't Purgatory. This is real. Most of the time our patients forget, so I'll explain. You've been in a simulation for 48 hours. You are 18 years old. The year is 2036. Due to overpopulation, we have decided to test individuals through a simulation of life. We observe your actions and take note of your skills and accomplishments. When it is over, we decide if you are worthy."	"Worthy of what?"							"A space in this world. We've decided that you are not."	"You... Wait, you what?"				"Based on what you've shown us, you do not have anything to add to our world. No social skills, no drive, no pride... You did not even parent your own child. We've decided that you don't deserve a life in our world."

I was flying home from CA and met this super cute girl while walking down the ramp to our plane. She's a biomed student in Idaho with gorgeous eyes, a sweet smile, and frankly just stunning from head to toe. After only a few minutes we found several things we had in common, and I even got her to laugh a couple times. She ended up sitting way behind me on the plane but I really wanted to see if I could get her number. So I ripped out a page from the in-flight magazine and wrote her a note that said:*As a scientist I'm wondering if you'd be willing to help me with a survey. I'm trying to find the best way to get the number of a cute girl I met on a plane (just in case I'm ever in southern Idaho) and wondering if a note is effective. If you would like to participate, would you be willing to rank its effectiveness on a scale of (000) 000-0000 to (999) 999-9999? For science. You can submit your survey by folding this piece of paper and leaving it in the storage door below the mirror in the bathroom behind you. If not, no worries and safe travels. :)*So I take this note and walk back to the bathrooms on the plane, and as I'm making my way back to my seat I lean over to her and say "I'm sorry, I think you dropped this" and walk back to my seat. The flight had about another 90 minutes before landing, so I tried to wait toward the end of the flight and made my way back again. She had her eyes closed listening to music as I passed so I didn't get to see her, but sure enough I walked into the bathroom and her note was there! It said:*My scientific curiosity is piqued! I'm happy to respond to your survey, as I always enjoy meeting new people. Oh, and my name is \_\_\_\_\_ by the way..."* WITH HER NUMBER!She even kept my original note to her, hopefully because it was memorable? I can't believe it actually worked.Also, here's how much I \*do not\* have game...I was so excited that I accidentally left the note in the goddamn bathroom! \*facepalm\* I got back to my seat, realized what I'd done, and practically sprinted to the back of the plane. A woman got out and took one look at my face and I knew that she knew. Haha, her face said it all. I said "did I leave a piece of paper in here?" and she said "yes, I just threw it in the trash." So there I am digging through the wet paper towels in the trash can like a goddamn maniac trying to find this note...I've got a couple people waiting for a bathroom poking their head around the door to see what's up, a flight attendant is asking me if I want gloves...but I found it! It was wet and a corner got ripped while I was digging but I'll be damned if I didn't get it.So yeah, MT if you're reading this, you made my day. Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did :)

One day in the 8th grade, I walked into my art class, and noticed we had a sub, nothing crazy about it, had a regular class and went about the day.Next day teach is back, we ask what happened since she doesn't sound sick or anything and cuz we're a bunch of nosey 12 year old brats. She tells us that near her apartment a man tried to mug someone at knifepoint. The victim overpowered the mugger and landed a hit on him, the mugger fled with injuries while the victim ran to report the crime. He ran into her apartment building and tried to open her door, with the knife... the lock was beyond damaged but never opened, instead it locked the door more. He slumped against her door and bled out. In the morning she tried to open her door to leave for school and was unable to open it. Called her landlord and next thing she knew the police were there and she was trapped in her apartment for the day.Funny thing is, no one cared after about a week. I just remembered it 8 years later and realized none of us even reacted about the severity of her situation. If the man was able to open her door she could've been killed by him.

When I was younger my mom was kinda a control freak. I started smoking cigarettes when I was 18 or so. I never told it but she knew. She started to snoop around my room looking for proof that I am indeed smoking cigarettes. If I got home and bring along the scent of cigs with me she would demand to smell my hands. I always tried to get rid off the smell, sometimes it worked sometimes it didn't. One evening I went to a girl I was hooking up with. We some sexual stuff and such. On my way home, a few hours later. I lighted up a few cigs, it was late at night and I was sure my parents would be asleep. As I enter my home I sniff my hand. "Hmm smells still a bit like pussy and cigs". I enter my living room and see my mom sitting there. She immediately could smell I smoked. Now she demanded to sniff my pussy/cigarette smelling hand. I panicked refused and went to my room. Got a huge fight over it. I would choose the fight everytime instead of letting my mom smelling my pussy scented hand.

This is a story that happened when I was 13 years old.I lived in a primarily white neighborhood, where there weren't a lot of black people, I was going to school and spending my days just like I was did when I was 13, but one day a boy called joey came to our still into my class.Joey was black.In fact I think he was the only black person in our entire school, already he was a sore thumb sticking out, but he was really just an ordinary boy just like me having similar interests like sports and comic books/video games.But the 13 year old me didn't understand that, in my eyes joey looked repulsive somehow, I thought he was unnatural, I obviously didn't hate him, it was just that I for some reason felt disgusted by him at that time because he was black, and it wasn't just me a lot of my classmates gossiped about him too seemingly sharing my opinion.Thinking we should play a prank on him we started to harass him almost everyday like hiding his school bag or giving him funny names.We thought it was all games and fun, but in reality this was just plain bullying and nothing else, but joey took it all, he was never really riled up every time something like this happened, neither did he call for anyone, he just silently endured until everyone stopped doing it as they got bored of it.I too stopped, but my repulsion never vanished, I simply started to avoid joey trying to think that he was not there.This was about the time fresh prince of bell-air started airing and probably a year later, our school since then had a lot more black people around and a lot of controversies were reported because of this, but I never kept them in mind being so young.Honestly I didn't like the show at first when it first aired, this being for the same reason as why I didn't like joey as I felt repulsed by the black actors.But my mother really liked the show, and since we only had 1 tv and I was addicted to the tv, I had no other choice but to watch it with my mother until I too started to actually like the show as well.I got over my repulsion of the black actors, but not against black people in real life as i was more engaged into the comedy.This is when finally the show started to teach the viewers its lessons in subtle ways, I hadn't watched the show in a long while so I don't remember the exact episode but.There was this one episode where will talks with carlton about their trip in the car and will starts to flip out about the police stopping the both of them.Carlton is oblivious as to why Will is so upset and starts saying that it all wouldn't have happened if they had a map which makes will even more upset as he realizes that carlton doesn't understand what racial profiling or discrimination is as he never seemed to have experienced the same thing as will as he came from a rich upbringing and a nice neighborhood.This scene ends with will sarcastically telling Carlton that it was all because of the map and not because of their skin color the police stopped them before leaving to his room while Carlton simply doesn't understand.The next scene is where carltons dad comes in and wishes his son good night, this is where carlton asks his father about whether or not the police did the right thing and were doing their "job", his father replies "I ask myself the first time I was stopped" and then says good night before leaving carlton by himself to contemplate.I don't know why this scene stuck with me so much or why as I child it had that much of a impact on me, but I thought it about for a week later and would stay up at night thinking about it while also thinking about all those other things I had done to joey and how he must have felt and why I did those things when he never did anything to me.I pondered on these thoughts for a month until I couldn't take it anymore and decided one day on our lunch break I would talk to joey.Our school had a lot more black people in it that time, but joey still was the only black person in our class, he was loner too as he never seemed to have attempted to talk to anyone neither did anyone else looked to have approached him.I found him sitting in the cafeteria by himself eating a radish sandwich, i knew that since I too ate those since they were my favorite.I didn't know how to approach him or how to talk him as I felt incredibly awkward doing what I was about to do, I also made sure nobody knew what I was doing which is why I tried to talk to him on lunch break since most of our classmates never went to the cafeteria to eat and brought their own lunch.Eventually I got over my awkwardness and came over intending to talk to him by sitting next to him, joey immediately noticed me when I sat near him, but didn't say anything other then glance at me before returning back to his sandwich.I too didn't talk and just like that I think an entire lunch break passed with us not talking and me just awkward as hell just sitting next to him saying nothing.I asked joey later when we were much older like what he thought when I did that, he told me that he thought I was about to harass him and that what I was doing was actually the most nervous he was compared to everything else he had experienced since he had never anyone sit like me next to him as silent as a rock without knowing what I would do.We laughed our ass's off.Anyways, this actually continued for like 4 days where I would sit down at lunch break next to joey without saying another word as I didn't know what to say exactly, you know how kids are asking for forgiveness isn't something kids can do that easily with their stubborn minds.But finally after third day and thinking how unbearable this was, I finally just wanted this to get with and when lunch break came around I again sat next to him with my own lunch and immediately spoke before he could start eating.\-I am sorry.\-what?\-I am sorry.\-ehm, for what?\-I am sorry for, doing the things I did to you.\-ah, okay.He started eating, I, not eating at all still waited as I expected to hear something else, but I never did as he simply ate while I looked at him waiting for the words I expected to hear.He too noticed me staring at me expectantly and stopped eating before turning to me.\-what?\-eh, so you forgive me?\-ah, no.And thats pretty much the end of conversation.I was totally dumbfounded and had no idea what to say next, joey too didn't seem to want to talk anymore and simply finished his lunch while I did too.for the next week, i pretty much pondered about what to do next, joey had refused my apology and I was clueless as to what to do.Because of that I simply continued to have my lunch with joey everyday since i got used to it, we also started talking, not about the apology, but just talking about hobbies like comics and video games.My repulsion towards him also disappeared as I started to understand joey as a person more then something else, before I knew it we became pretty tight friends going over to each others houses and playing.My original friends also became more friendly with joey once I started to invite and play with him more, this continued until our high school years and even until university as both me and joey attended the same university studying different fields with me studying geology and him studying chemistry.We stayed friends our entire life really, and the reason I am making this post is because I wanted to tell this story as joey had married recently and asked me to become his best man where I told the same story at his wedding.We drunk that night too with me asking how being a married man was like and him replying he couldn't be happier.We got pretty drunk because of that and since I told the story, there something on the back of my mind that I forgot and wanted to ask.After all these years, did joey ever forgive me.I asked him, both of us being absolutely wasted as we sat on the terrace.I didn't see his face, but he did tell me.No, even after all these years he said, he still hadn't forgiven me.Being in a drunken stupor, he said that I was his best friend and that he would never forgive me, that he would hold this grudge until we both became rotten old men and that I had to always stay with him so that I would one day forgive myself instead of asking him something so irrelevant.And just like that we are here.I am writing this post in a effort to do exactly that as I don't really want to keep this up until me and joey both become old men, not that I mind, but I rather leave something like this behind instead of keeping it with me.I hope others too can learn something from this story in a sense.And always fresh prince of bel-air is the best tv show in the world, everything else nowadays is trash!fight me imbeciles!

So I was having a wank in my chair when I heard a knock on my door, after quickly exiting the browser and covering up with my dressing gown I said yea pretty shakily as I was a bit out of breath and pretty nervous/embarrassed. My mum then opens the door slowly and asks me what was wrong in a very concerned tone. I realised that my odd behaviour, shaky out of breath voice and the little fight me and my dad had a little while before and my ongoing fight against depression had caused her to think that I was crying. It was then that realised I had a split second decision to act like I was either; A. Having a bit of a breakdown or B. Tell her I was just wanking. So I obviously went with A. and really went Leonardo-level acting with it. She started getting pretty emotional saying she wishes she could help more and comes and gives me a hug. I'm still out of breath and really play the shaky voice card telling me she's doing more than enough and that I'll be alright. After a little while and me getting my breath back she asked what it was that set it off.  The only thing I could think to say was "I had just been watching a very emotional video"

Quite the story. It was a while ago at the supermarket It was a really cold day. Everyone outside was wearing coats and hoodies, the usual stuff for this type of day.I get of the car with my hoodie on walked fast to the store.As i approached the door which was being fixed, so rhere was a small gap to go it, i hear someone running behind me.I turn around so i can move bc she wasnt even gonna say excuse me or anything just run to beat me in.I move and i hear her say- Stop looking at me you PERVERT!! I nicely say im not even looking at u i just wanted to move bc u were running inside and i didnt hear u say excuse me or anything.  She looks at me and flips me off. I hear someone laughing and it was her friend who also preceded to flip me off.So i guess she thought i was looking at her bc.. she was wearing and undershirt with some tight sweats.In all honesty i didnt even notice until they both flipped me off. All people in the store kept staring at me the whole time i was there. It felt weird, im a quiet guy so im not always socializing with people there which i guess made it look like i was looking. Oo wellHave a nice day people if u read thisNot a fun story, neither interesting but hopefully someone read it.

I�m fifteen and my english is pretty decent, so I use to go around and search for stuff to translate when I�m bored, so that I can improve myself and relax. One day, around 2 a.m, I couldn�t manage to fall asleep, so I took my laptop and searched for a Wikipedia page I was interested about and found out it wasn�t translated in my native language. �That�s not fair at all�, I thought. So I started translating it on my own, because if others don�t do that for you, then do it first. It took me around one hour, and at the end my work was pretty good and I was proud of it, so I took a photo and posted it on my twitter. Apparently, my English teacher (a pretty fresh and cool dude) managed to find my tweet, so after a week he comes up to me and says: �I read your translation about [...] and I found it pretty good for a fifteen years old student, so I decided to give you a mark for that. Good job.� I was pretty shocked about the twitter thing, but I didn�t give a fuck considering the mark!

*i am not too sure how this works or if anybody will read this, but I need to talk/write about it because I have been having challenges a lot recently. I have PTSD and Anxiety because of an event that happened when I was five years old (I am 29 years old now). Well, here goes...**When I was five years old, I was SO EXCITED when my baby sister was born. I also had an older sister. But I was ecstatic because I was a big sister now too! My mother gave birth to my beautiful sister. Her name is Elizabeth. The night she was born, my sister and I went to the hospital to meet her. I couldn�t wait! I sat on a chair where she was placed into my arms. I looked into her eyes as she looked into mine. I told her that I loved her for the first time out of the womb. That night, I feel asleep next to my mother and baby sister in the hospital bed (my mom was nursing her). I woke up in my bed the next morning. The day my sister and mother came home was one of the best days of my life! Over the next couple of days, I rushed off of the bus excitedly after school to go see my sister. When she was four days old, my dad noticed that she was having a harder time breathing than what was normal. He took her to the pediatricians office where they said she was fine. We gave her a bath that night and all went to bed. The next day, my older sister and I woke up and went to my parent�s room to see Elizabeth. Elizabeth was there, lying in her crib. But something was different about her... she was blue... I rushed to wake up my dad and said, �Daddy, wake up...our baby is blue... What�s wrong with her, Daddy?! Is she okay?!� He jumped out of bed and rushed to her, he screamed �CALL 911!� And proceeded to give her CPR. Elizabeth was not responding. The next thing I knew, ambulances and the police showed up. I was rushed to my babysitter�s house upstairs from us (we lived in an apartment complex). On my way up the stairs, I feel on the concrete steps (I have a a scar from that fall). The babysitter tried distracting my sister and I by turning on Oliver and Company. A while later, we were taken by the police to the hospital. The adults in my family were gathered around. My father and my grandfather took me in a golf cart. The whole ride was silent. My grandfather pulled over and he and my father started bawling. I was so confused... �When can I see my baby sister, Daddy and Grandpa?� Silence. About thirty seconds later, my dad softly mumbled, �Honey, your baby sister went to Heaven...she didn�t make it.� At that point, I never saw my dad or grandpa cry. I was automatically devastated. I didn�t understand...she was five days old, the doctors said she was okay. Turns out that the doctor fu\*\*ed up...he didn�t check her well enough. so many thoughts went through my head. My sister was permanently gone, HE killed my sister. So much anger. He could have saved her if he just took time to check her heart. Surgery could have prevented her death. She had Aortic Coarctation. My parents were under investigation for �murder� until the autopsy proved that it was her heart. Other kids came up to me at school just to tell me my parents were �baby killers� because their �parents said so.� I literally wanted to die. I HATED those kids. Kids can be terrible.**Over the next week or so, my whole family came to town to help us put my beautiful sister to rest. I remember EVERYTHING, even though I was so young. I was, and still am absolutely traumatized. I remember every feeling, I remember everybody�s devastated facial expressions, I remember wishing it was me and not her. I remember receiving a teddy bear at her memorial. I buried my teddy bear with her. I remember trying to jump into her grave to be buried with her. I felt suicidal at five years old. I remember being grabbed by my parents when I tried to jump into her grave, and the feeling of their tears dropping in my hair.**My sister and I were diagnosed with PTSD and Anxiety. Our baby sister would be 24 years old today. Today, we still struggle. We both have children of our own now. I can�t help but to be anxious and nervous all the time to the point where I feel myself freaking out about something happening to my children, although they are all healthy. I have flashbacks here and there which suck. Today, I work with children who suffer from serious mental illnesses. Many of them have PTSD and Anxiety. I WAS and still am that kid, I can relate. I would wish this experience on NOBODY, not even my worst enemy. As I wrap this story up, I am so sorry for the length. I know that nobody will probably read this, but if you do, thank you. I feel a little better that I was able to type this out because I have held it in for so long. I am screwed up for the rest of my life. I hope I can help my work kids to overcome their PTSD...I am that person, that voice, for them that I needed. I will work and do my best to help these kids and anybody else who suffer from these problems, because I don�t want them to feel the way I did starting at five years old. Rest in Paradise, our precious little Elizabeth.*

So I�m headed to Colorado...I told the flight attendant when I got on that things would be tight for the connecting flight and asked if there were empty spots if she'd consider moving me up.She moved me up to first class.But when she did it she came back and with a very stern voice said "sir, you need to come with me"Then she took me to first class, sat me down, and whispered in my ear, "I had to make it sound like you were in trouble or else everyone would ask to move up."Then she stood back up, wagged her finger at me, and loudly said, "SO DONT DO IT AGAIN" and walked away.And that is how I flew first class for the first time!

I have a mild Asperger�s complex. It�s been there since the age of five. I�ve always struggled with crippling shyness. It wasn�t until my late twenties that that shyness turned to loneliness. I live in a motel room with cash I make from a side job at a bakery. I hate my life.I think it was at age 27 when I realized I genuinely wanted to die. It was never a complaining thing; I think that whining and complaining about your problems makes them less real. It was all on the inside, and it was a plan.Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to be a superhero. All I ever wanted to do was help people. But you can never look too inviting walking around the streets of Miami at night. I�m not a very attractive person. I always look threatening. The way my face is composed, my eyes are stern and locked, and my jaw sticks out a little too forward. I look like a meat-head bodyguard without the muscle.I always knew that if I saw someone getting mugged, I would intervene. I had way too little self-worry to care about my well-being. I walked those streets for three years. The worst thing I ever saw was a hobo junkie trying to sell me a heroin needle. (I didn�t take it.)I could never kill myself manually. I wasn�t afraid. It�s just that, in my head, I couldn�t go out like that. That was cowardly, and it was so overdone. You hear on the news all the time about the depressed businessman divorcee with the overflowing debt who cut his wrists in the hotel room. That wasn�t me. That wasn�t my style.I wanted to die saving a life.Couple nights ago, I was walking down by the pier and heard some scuffle from an alleyway. I walked over and saw a man pinning a woman against the wall. She was drunk, he was not. The woman was kind of putting up a fight. But her drunkenness left her with no energy. She was practically flailing her arms around, and he would slap them away.The woman reminded me of my mother. Pretty, somewhat Italian, really wide brown eyes. So, I guess for that reason, I felt an immediate connection with her. It was weird, given the situation, that I would take the time to form an emotional connection. But I�m pretty fucked up.The man went from toying with her almost, to slamming her head back against the wall. She groaned, then dropped. That�s when he went to undo the buttons on her dress.The adrenaline made me move. I walked over to intervene, but he was already throwing punches. I was coughing up blood by the seventh. I fell over by the trashcan. Through my faded vision, I saw him pick up the girl and start walking away.I was always a quick thinker. I took off my shoe and started to undo the laces. Once I held the string in my hand, I walked over to the man, threw the string over the back of his head, and yanked toward me. The string caught his neck, and he began to choke. For some reason, he kept trying to walk forward, like I hadn�t just begun to murder him.He caught on after the first four seconds. He slowly let the girl tumble to the ground, then started to tug at the string. The noises that came from him was the part was messed me up the most. It was like a pig dry-heaving or being drowned. It was like a fucked up version of David and Goliath.In the movies, it takes about 10 seconds to choke someone out. In real-life, it takes about two minutes. I learned that that night.In my head, the scenario in which I died would always go like this: The bad guy would be a mugger with a blade. He would have a lady or someone in his grasp. I would sweet-talk while moving forward under his subconscious. Then I would lunge. He�d drop the lady and stick me in the gut, but not before I forced the knife into the neck. Then we�d bleed out together. I would know the lady was safe, and I�d die peacefully.The way it ended up going, I was still alive. The lady was unconscious at this point. I�m pretty sure he roofied her drink. My stomach and lungs hurt like a motherfucker from the punches, but I had to tend to her. I stood and picked her up in my arms. She was really light. Maybe 115. The walk to the police station wasn�t very far, nor difficult. I took her inside. They made me undergo a really long process. Took a few weeks to get everything settled, but I was happy to do it.The girl thanked me after, then we parted ways. I never saw her again. But I hope she�s very happy.I don�t feel like ending my life anymore. Maybe it�s because I served a purpose that night. Or maybe it�s because I couldn�t forgive myself if it happened to a future girl. All I know is that I�ll be there when it does to do the same thing over again.I�d like to think I did the right thing.

It seems like committing federal crimes is ok these days, so I'm ok admitting to one. Here goes...  A few weeks ago I committed a federal crime. Accidentally, I swear.  I was opening all my snail mail that had piled up that week, and after being opened, discovered that one piece was my neighbor's monthly student debt bill. Current balance wasn't huge (that is, not like medical school sized). He was about halfway through paying it back.  According to the sheet, he had never missed a payment, and had�over the years�paid back an amount equivalent to the full amount of the original borrowed principle. But, he was only halfway there because of interest. Maybe less than halfway, since interest would still accrue. So, it being Thanksgiving Day, I wrote a check, and dropped it in the mail, paying off the entire remaining balance.   I've never met this guy. If I ran into him on the street, I wouldn't recognize him.  Four or five people live in that house next door. He'll probably be confused. He might track me down as the culprit. He might not. Hopefully someday, he'll pay it forward.

I had a primary school friend who slowly started talking less and less to me. He would still hang around but wouldn't talk nearly as much as usual. I thought it was just personality change, until one day I asked for something. He passes it to me, and as he does I see his sleeve pull back and there is a long cut there on his arm. I asked how he got it but he quickly covered it up and moved away.I was small, and didn't think much of it. He took on a more resigned, empty kind of personality. I started to worry about his mental health (this is in Year 6 now) and I urge him to talk to someone but he kept saying, "There's no point."We're walking home, and we come to a traffic light. The red man lights up, we stop, the cars start moving, but there is one Range Rover still catching up to the rest of the cars from a small distance away. My friend chose this moment to turn to me and say,"Don't blame yourself.""You were a good friend"And he walked out onto the road in front of the Range Rover.Thank all things holy that his bag was still in reach and I managed to pull him back off the road. Turns out his step dad had been mentally abusing him, calling him useless, beating him, etc. He now lives happily with his mum, who still thanks me when I see her for saving her son.Edit: Thank you everyone for the support! Means a lot. Have a great day!

We are both now in our twenties now. I am staying at my sisters house. Her and I start talking about our mom and how she was always so controlling and how our experiences with her were very much the same. I told her that I had a vivid memory about the time she got kicked out, and how I still felt so guilty about it because I was essentially the reason she had to live with a friend for most of high school. I told her my memory of that day (Keep I mind I was 7 years old, so my memory is not perfect):�Flash forward to the day before she was kicked out. I just got home from elementary school, and it was about 2:30 I would say. My sister was in school until 3, and mom usually worked until around 4. My sister told me that mom would be home at 4, and then she would be going to this event that she had been planning on for about two weeks. We sat and watched tv and played some games while we waited for mom. She called mom upset because she was late. She needed to go, but she couldn�t because mom wasn�t here. She seemed really upset and hung up the phone. She talked to me for about thirty minutes, repeatedly asking me if it was alright that she go. We were dog sitting someone�s dog, and I had told her reluctantly many times that I would be fine because the dog was here. She told me that if I was not comfortable with her going, then she would stay and it would be no problem. I knew she wanted to go, I knew she had these plans for a while so I insisted that I would be okay. She knew that she should have stayed, but I also understand that after all that piling up, she needed to go and do something to make her feel better. I don�t blame her AT ALL for leaving. She isn�t my mom, she is not my caregiver. She is my sister. She ended up going to the party and I was alright for about an hour, and then something happened that I can�t quite remember, and I ended up having a little breakdown. I called my mom, because I didn�t know my sister�s number at the time and I was crying asking if she could come home. I told her that my sister was upset and she wanted to go to the event and that I had told her it was okay that she leave me there, that I would be okay on my own. My mom came home immediately. The next day I woke up and went to my sisters room. She wasn�t there, so I was worried. I then went to my moms room and she told me to get ready so I did. It was a Saturday which meant we were going to my grandmas house to spend time with her, and we were walking out to the car when my sister walked down the driveway. I immediately ran to my sister telling her that I was so sorry that I told mom and how I felt so bad for freaking out. My sister assured me that it was okay and that she loved me very very much and she was sorry she put me in that situation. My sister went inside and put her things away and came out to the car, my mom didn�t say a single word to her. When my sister came out to the car to come to grandmas house, my mom told me that my sister didn�t live with us anymore. My sister was standing right there. She told my sister she had 15 minutes to pack her things. She took her phone away, she didn�t even have a debit card or anything to get her anywhere. I was hysterically crying, thinking that i was the reason that my sister had to leave. I told on her and our mom kicked her out. In my brain that was the only thing that made sense. It was my fault. I couldn�t handle being alone, and now I would never get to see my sister again because I was too scared to be by myself for one night. I went into the house and grabbed one of my stuffed animals, wrote my sister a note explaining how sorry I was and how much I loved her and gave it to her as she left. She started to cry. Then she walked down the driveway and I didn�t see her for a long time after that. ���Years later, my sister and I are visiting and we were talking about this day. I told her I still felt guilty for getting her kicked out of the house. She looked at me and almost started to cry, telling me that it was in no way my fault. And she told me what had actually happened:���4 weeks before my sister got kicked out, she had a dance recital. She worked so hard on her dance all throughout high school and our mom had told her that she couldn�t go because she had to work. This was a pretty normal thing, our mom worked a lot to support the two of us by herself. A couple weeks later my sister made plans to go to an event with her friends, which she told our mom about when she made the plans. And our mom said yes, and that all she needed to do was remind her that she had this event a little closer to the time it was. The day of the event my sister had called my mom around lunch reminding her that she had this event tonight and that she wouldn�t be home to babysit me. My mom knew that this was the case as she had been told two weeks before and reminded a few hours before. My mom asked my sister to just stay at the house until 4, then she would be home to watch me. My sister said yes, but that she would have to leave right after 4. My mom agreed. 4:30 rolls around and Mom is nowhere to be found, my sister had been calling her to see when she would be home because she had plans that night. Mom calls back, angry, saying that she had plans to go to her friend�s daughter�s dance recital this night. She told my sister to just suck it up and babysit me. My sister was heartbroken and angry, because not only did she do all the things she was supposed to do, she talked to my mom and reminded her and called her to make sure she remembered, but also our mom had missed her own daughters recital a month prior. She was upset and really needed to just get out of the house. My sister talked to me for about an hour, asking if it was okay that she go to this event. I repeatedly told her that I would be okay because the dog was there to keep me company. She said that I looked petrified, that I kept looking at the ground and almost starting to cry when I would say that she could go and that it was no problem. She could see the horror in my eyes and told me that she wouldn�t go, because she didn�t want me to be scared. I kept telling her it would be fine and the dog would keep me safe. She finally reluctantly agreed that I would be okay. She made me food and turned on my favourite movie and she left. She got to the event and she was already worried about me. She thought that she should just go home, because she knew how scared I was. She told herself that I would be okay because I told her I would be. So she stayed, had fun and tried to forget how upset she was about our mom going to some other kids recital when she couldn�t make it to her own. She woke up the next morning and got her things together. She headed home on the bus and got to the driveway. She saw myself and my mom walk out of the house to the car. I ran to her and told her I was sorry and I started to cry. She bent down and told me that it wasn�t my fault and that she shouldn�t have left. She told me she loved me very much and then she said she had to go get ready for grandmas. She walked past my mom and put her things away. She got ready in about 5 minutes and came back out to the car. She was about to climb in when our mom said that she didn�t live with us anymore. She was completely shocked and asked mom why, and begged to stay. I started crying hysterically and asking why mom was doing this to her, and mom only said that she had 15 minutes to get her things. She ran inside and started frantically packing, trying not to cry as she thought about how she had nowhere to stay, nowhere to go. I came into her room and handed her a stuffy and a note, and she started crying and was hugging me as I was crying. Then I went out to the car still crying, and she walked out of the house for the last time. Mom told her to hand over her phone and her wallet, and that she better not come back. I got into the car and was screaming and pleading that mom let her stay, but mom just closed the door and drove away. My sister only had about 30 cents on her. She walked to a pay phone and called her best friends number, the only one she had memorized, and they weren�t home. So she got on a bus and rode it to one of her other friends� works and asked to stay with him. He said of course and she stayed with him for about three days before she moved in with her best friends family for the rest of high school. � Shortly after my sister graduated, my mom and I moved to Alberta. I had only seen my sister a handful of times, and didn�t get to say goodbye to her. For years I carried around this guilt. Thinking that I was the problem. I was the reason my mom hated my sister. I was the reason she had to go, I was the reason we moved away. It messed me up. But now I can see that our mom was not alright, she�s being treated for her mental illnesses after all these years. My mom painted a picture of my sister, made it seem like my sister hated me because I was the reason she got kicked out. She made it seem like it was my fault. I didn�t talk to my sister for years because I was afraid she still hated me. Then, right before my graduation I called her to see if I could go stay with her for a while back in our hometown. She loved the idea and was super excited to see me. I was so nervous. I thought that if I said the wrong thing or did the wrong thing that she would hate me again, so I stayed there but barely talked to her. It�s only now, years and years later that I finally understand that she never hated me. She never thought it was my fault. Now we have a great relationship and it�s not weird. She is my sister and my best friend.

This is a story of how my housing became most visited on hypixel.When I was, like, 13 or 14, me and my equally dumb, younger brother were playing hypixel housing. If for some reason you don't know what hypixel housing is, it's a gamemode where you get a nice piece of land and you can build anything you want in it. And what did we build on my free real estate?A strip club!That's right we built a Minecraft strip club, why? IdkSo we built a large, I think it was wooden, box with a big penis at the entrance and all these dancing pols on tables inside. It even had nicer bathrooms than the ones you would find in a gas station.So when we finished building and hysterically laughing every five minutes. We made it public and it didn't take long for the ''Sexy Night Club'' (I think it was called like that) to became one of the most, if not the most visited housings on the server. People were joining our world and doing what they usually do in strip clubs. I felt like I brought joy to the world.But it only lasted about 5 minutes because a hypixel's mod joined the world and threatened me with a ban if I don't shut the world down. So I did, but I still remember to this day that the people of hypixel were dancing on a big dick.

In 8th grade, a holocaust survivor visited our school. We had just learned about the holocaust and other Nazi war crimes in social studies, so we all understood that the story we were about to hear would be gut-wrenching. Unsurprisingly, his story was extremely depressing. The poor guy never saw his parents or siblings again after being separated at a concentration camp. A lot of people were getting choked up, including myself. After he finished his story, the man asked if we had any questions for him. A hand sprung up and we quickly realized it belonged to a notorious dumb ass. My friends and I looked at each other, knowing this sure as hell is not going to end well.The girl stands up, clears her throat, and asks:�If you could go back, would you?� Not the best way to start a Q & A, but it sure was entertaining. The survivor lost his cool and kept asking �what do you mean? Why would you say that?� She tried to rephrase her question but it sounded just as dumb, all the while the teachers were panicking on the inside and about 80% of the student body lost their minds. TL;DR A girl asked a holocaust survivor if he would want to go back in time and experience it again.

I don�t know if anyone else will find this funny, but here goes. For as long as I can remember, my mom and dad have had this joke. Any time she sees the show The Commish (on the guise on the tv, a dvd at a store, on a tv at the doctor�s office, whatever), my mom will turn to my dad and say �hey, look. It�s your favorite show!� My dad will chuckle a little bit and that will be that. The funny thing is, I have never seen my dad actually watch that show. He�s never tried to get me to watch it with him, quoted it, nothing. So finally I asked what the deal was and my mom told me the story. The first Christmas my mom and dad we�re engaged, my dad went to my mom�s parents house for the holiday and it was the first time he was going to meet them. He got really really sick. Now, this is weird enough because in my entire 23 years of life I remember my dad being sick like 5 times. But apparently he had like a 103 fever and was practically delirious. So someone was going to change the tv channel while The Commish was on and my dad was like �nooo!! That�s my favorite show!� When he finally got better, someone asked him and, not only did he not remember saying that, but he said he�d never even seen the show. I don�t know why I find this so funny, but I�ve been laughing at this for 5 minutes. My mom has been making this joke for 25 years!

True story.You know those robocalls you keep getting from "Hilton Hotels Rewards" or whatever they are? Got one today and I finally didn't get dropped when I pressed 0 to talk to them. Indian-ish sounding gal answers. Asks who I am."Bob," I say, in my most redneck sounding accent.She proceeds to tell me about this awesome vacation that I've won and I let her go for 5-10 minutes, answering her questions in redneck-ese. Then she tells me that the vacation is for 2 adults and 2 children. Who would I be taking?"Well, I'd prolly take my wife. And my mistress," I drawled."I'm sorry sir, but it's only 2 adults - you and one other - plus 2 children," she interjects."Well, that's not a problem!" I say - "my mistress is underage!"She hung up on me.

Saw someone I remembered from high school as a "recommended friend" on Facebook. She seems happy; is engaged to be married, has a kid and a job that she seems to really enjoy judging by her available to see posts.Seeing her face and hearing her name...it reminded me of an incident from high school that she was part of. Something that still makes me feel uncomfortable even now. Encase she has chosen to leave this stuff in the past, I won't use her real name; lets call her "Ami".We were 14/15 and attended a catholic high school, which meant morning assemblies everyday. My friends and I started ditching them since they were about very mundane shit that we already knew: "brush your vegetables and eat your teeth" kinda thing. We would initially stay in toilets and chat, but as ditching became more popular, they had staff patrolling the school ground and would take those they caught to assembly or if it had finished; detention.This probably didn't have the effect they intended: it became more fun to sneak around without being caught. We jokingly made up "platoons" where groups would assign one person to lead their given platoon, if you let someone get caught, it was seen as disgraceful...which is exactly what I did.I was with 3 guys, went out the room and around the corner to check if the coast is clear, came back in to find my platoon being lectured by a teacher as I quietly made my way back out while his back was turned. Snuck into an empty classroom, where I thought I was safe. Only to then hear footsteps coming up the hall. I assumed my platoon had ratted me out and hid in a school closet; it had a small window on the door. I then watched "Ami" and a teacher come into the classroom; holding hands.Didn't even cross my mind that this was suspect; I feared being caught. But my tension soon became fear as I watched what followed: first was the teacher walking up to the door, making sure no one was out there while Ami sat on the table smiling. Next came some quiet whispering to each other; I could only guess what they were saying. But then...they kissed: passionately with tongues and the teacher grabbing her undeveloped breast...ugh.  Even as a young teen when even so much as reading the word "boob" gives you a boner, my dick seemed to understand this wasn't the time for that. I had stopped trying to duck behind the door and instead watched on in utter disbelief; Kinda like a car crash.This went on for an uncomfortable amount of time, until footsteps were heard coming up the hall (the place echoed). The star crossed lovers ripped themselves off of each other. The teacher started to adjust his clothes and wiped away any lipstick while Ami...scurried towards the closet.She moved so quickly; rushing into the closet and doing that thing cartoons do where they starfish spread themselves against the door before looking up and noticing me staring back at her; her face said it all. To this day, one of the most uncomfortable situations I can think of. We came out of the closet once we heard the voices outside get further away. We didn't say anything until I reached for the door:"He's a great guy!"What?"Hes better than any of you assholes!"O...okay? I didn't--Ami then went on to lecture me why she was lucky to be in a relationship with such an accomplished man. That all guys her age here were immature and judged girls by the size of their breast than what kind of person they were. "The forbidden factor makes it better" is something that in retrospect makes me throw up a little. She then sealed the deal with "if you tell anyone about us, I will tell about you!"Go ahead, do it."What?"I didn't care about the platoon bullshit anymore; I knew this was much more serious/important. "I don't really care, this is way more important!". Ami then shrieked back about how all of us boys ruin everything and started to cry. I felt awful, so I tried my best to calm her down with frantic apologies and small talk.Said small talk actually became quite enlightening: without making this story another 5000 words long, i'll sum up that our conversation was about if she truly loved him and vice versa. How he'd pushed for sex and pictures of her naked (BLECK!). I'd promised not to say anything and left the rest up to her. From our conversation, I had no reason to believe her stance would change anytime soon.2 months later, I would pass that same classroom on my way to get lunch. I was puzzled to see the door broken off and a police woman stood outside the room. Teachers were trying unsuccessfully to get on lookers to move along and some of said onlooking students taking out their phones for pictures. It was then that the "pedo teacher" from before emerged from the classroom, accompanied by a policeman. The local newspaper would later confirm my suspicion that this teacher was in fact arrested for pedophilia. But it was after Ami went to the police about it "with proof".I have no idea if my talk influenced that decision (feels a bit egotistical to say that our conversation made her think to do this) but i'm glad she did and she seems happy with someone else 8 years later.  The school is still running and is considered the best where I live...but it's still awful; there has been 2 separate cases of student and teacher relationships since then that have had the police involved...

One time I got really drunk while out with friends and Gordon Ramsay came to pick me up and brought me to his place. When I was there I found a frozen pizza in his freezer and decided I needed to sue him. He got mad and started shouting at me so I ran and hid in a broom closet. I called the police and told them that Gordon Ramsay had frozen pizzaand then I woke up.

I was sitting in high school art class during lunch working on some pottery.  Next thing I know I�m being escorted to the principals office.  I�m accused of sexual assaulting someone in the hallway during movement.  What did I do? �You know what you did.�   No I don�t, what am I being accused of.  �Are you really going to make me say it!�  You grabbed her breast in the hallway!!!� In the office Principal says, she�s already identified me when I walked through the office hall.  The police have been called and are coming. I�m scarred and confused.  How could this be happening? Think about everything you did during movement.  Why is this happening?  Did someone give her the wrong name?  Wait...did I do it?  Why won�t anyone believe me?I�m a teenager, I space out, I have hormones, I�m horny all the time.  Oh shit, I�ve fucked up.  What the fuck is happening?!?Girls in the art class, no I don�t know their names.  No I don�t know what they look like, I think one has blonde hair.   Somehow I convince the principal to check my alibis.  I�m locked in his office alone, I can hear secretaries and office staff gossiping through the walls.  I can�t make out what their saying other than some high tones and oh that�s terrible.  I�m a nobody, I�m a little boy in a room with no hope.The girls confirm I was in Art class when the assault was accused.  What time was that I wasn�t even told that.  I�m excused from the office I�m given no information.  I�m dying inside, I feel sad, everyone is looking at me.  No one wants to talk to me.  �Go back to class!�I arrive in class which has filled with students waiting for the lunch period to end.  Everyone is doing their own thing.  No one knows what just happened.  I thank those girls who thought it was funny my fate was in their hands.  I don�t even know their names.I sit back at my art station and just zone out on my art piece, my half eaten chocolate donut still on my lunch tray.  Class starts and the world moves on with a disoriented teenage boy trying to process what just happened during his lunch break and how all that just happened in 30 minutes.I�m 40 now, never learned who made the accusation.  Was never given justice for the slander.  That event still haunts me.  Then again life has put me through it more than once. ���������Thank you for reading.  Before this happened and since, life likes to put me through it.  I have so many stories of life being nasty.  Luckily, I�ve had enough success in life and in love that I have people I hold on too.  But I also have anxiety close to PTSD which has developed from experience and stressful jobs I chose to take.  I suffer from night terrors and problems close to being flashbacks.  As such I have a dark personality and sense of humor which is often inappropriate. I control myself with medication which makes it easier to live and make it easier for my wife and children to live around.I just found r/stories I hope to contribute more as the muse strikes me.  Thank you again.

I originally told this embarrassing story to some friends and after nearly dying of laughter they told me to post it on Reddit. This happened back when I was a student a UT Arlington. I was walking around campus in the afternoon after classes when my colon decided that It was time to evacuate my bowels. Now, to give you some information about me, when I need to go poop I can't just pick any restroom. I prefer to find a fairly secluded (and clean) bathroom where I can effectually Poop in absolute peace and quiet.I walked into a nearby building that I knew had a well maintained, and quiet bathroom. The bathroom in question had alot of stalls and at this time of the day didn't have any nearby classes for the rest of the day.  I took the second to the last stall closest to the far wall and dropped my pants to get ready to take the browns to the superbowl. As i'm pulling out my phone to look at Facebook I freeze as I hear the bathroom door open and somebody walk in. I sat motionless as I hear the guy take the stall next to me, take some stuff out his bookbag, and drops his pants. I was about to just ignore it and start dropping some brown bombs when I hear the sound of anime coming from his stall. I curiously listened to see if it was something I might recognize. To my surprise the only thing I can decipher was the sounds of a women having an orgasm."This dude's really watching hentai right now" I said to my self as I still sat there motionless and not making a noise. My ears where then greeted with another sound: the rhythmic pounding sound of a man yanking his wank. I covered my mouth to stifle a giggle as I hear this man beating his sword into a plowshare. It didn't stop there, as the sound of hentai and fapping went on It was joined by a third sound: him breathing hard and aggressively saying obscene things such as  "yeah! take that dick you slut!" , "you're a naughty little b\*tch aren't you?" and more shockingly "Take that tentacle dick!!!" (tentacle porn? seriously?)I could not believe WTF was going on in the stall next to me, or the fact that he did not know that I was there. My colon then reminded me of why I was in the bathroom in the first place. I decided that I wouldn't disturb the man choking his lizard in the next stall and try to poop as quietly as possible. My bowels however, did not agree with this plan. As I tried to push out the first turd quietly, It decided that it would announce it's arrival by sounding off one of loudest farts known to mankind. The fart lasted a full 4 seconds and echoed throughout the men's room and ended with a small "Ploop" as it dived into the toilet bowl.I sat there , wide-eyed and flabbergasted, for what felt like an eternity as the bathroom fell dead quiet. All noise coming from the next stall over had stopped. At this point, I began to rethink every choice I made that day that led up to this moment of awkwardness. I just sat there; wondering "Dear God what do I do now?". I could just leave, but that would mean that I would run the risk of a confrontation with this tentacle porn fapper or having to do a Butt-clench walk across campus to another bathroom. On the other hand, I wanted to be anywhere but there. At the same time, the tentacle fapper was still silent.The standoff was still in a deadlock when it gave way to another problem: my mom's Onion-lacked, spicy chili that I had for lunch produced some of the most foul smelling turds mankind has ever known (not to mention making my anus feel like an f-16's afterburner). The onions cooked into the chili made sure that the smell would make your eyes water as it raped your sense of smell. I soon heard the fapper in the next stall cry out "oh God!" as he began to gag. He quickly grabbed his stuff and left the bathroom. I spent the rest of my number two trying to not gag on the horrible smell as while crying from the added onions. I finished up, and walked out praying that I may never had to encounter another bathroom fapper.

I feel like I have to post this story from when I was in high school somewhere because it�s hands down one of the funniest things to ever happen to me. When I was a sophomore in high school there was a junior that was very well known for being the bad kid. Earlier in the year he had been caught for having sex with a freshman in the bathroom and there were countless other things he had been caught for. Anyways, kids had been posting all over social media about how this kid brought a Chicken to school. There were snapchats everywhere showing that this kid had a LITERAL Chicken in his backpack and he was going around asking people �you wanna see my cock?�. Later in the day, at lunch, I was minding my business when all of the sudden two kids start screaming at each other. Come to find out it was the Chicken kid and some guy that he had pissed off for an unknown reason. After screaming for a while, the other kid threw an incredibly hard punch at the Chicken boy and it was so hard that it knocked him to the ground and onto his back. Note that he was still wearing the backpack. Security had just started to make their way down the stairs towards the cafeteria when the kid threw the punch. As the Chicken boy landed, on his back, the Chicken let out one of probably the worst noises I had ever heard. It screamed so loud that the whole lunchroom went silent. The security guard was so confused that he approached the kid and removed his bag. He opened it and, I kid you not, the Chicken jumped out and scared the shit out of him. After he realized wtf was happening he started chasing after it, as did a couple of the other security guards. It was probably the most comical thing I have ever seen to witness four grown men chasing after a Chicken, not really sure why it�s even there. Eventually they called animal control to come and get the Chicken and both kids got in huge trouble (the Chicken kid more so, obviously). A few months later he was arrested after committing multiple robberies where he broke into over a dozen cars in one night (including my grandfather�s).

I sat in my dad�s living room reading one night while he watched television. An hour passed before I realized it, and I felt bad for not speaking during that time. I asked if he was OK, and he said yes. Then I apologized for not talking more.��Carmen,� Dad replied. �Talking is like ketchup. If you like the meat enough, you don�t need the ketchup�and if you like the company enough, you don�t need the conversation.� My dad never earned a college degree, but he was the smartest person I ever knew.

When my fiance and I were only a few months into our relationship, I had a "pregnancy scare". I put that in quotes because one missed pill at the end of a cycle with condoms does not a pregnancy make but I had just finished my first semester of college, only 21, and this relationship was fairly new so I panicked myself straight to the store to get a test. I got my test and headed to self check out to keep this little excursion of shame induced hysteria to myself. While waiting in line, I get hailed by the woman at the cash register within the self check out. Her register is open and she has me come over. Sheepishly I hand over my test and swipe my card, trying to not look at her. As she presses the test into my hands she looks at me and says: "I hope you get the result you want".I. Was. Mortified. She knew I had a pregnancy test and acknowledged it! How rude right? That's what I thought at the time as I slunk away to my apartment to take it. But now looking back almost three years later, I appreciate that woman. She passed absolutely no judgement. She didnt assume what I wanted. She said probably the best thing she could have. The test was a negative so I did get the result I wanted and I'm very thankful. I wish I could thank her for being so kind when I was obviously incredibly scared.

Please admire my Target CVS review, below ;)Literally the worst pharmacy ever.� My insurance forced me to fill here, probably because Target has a deal with them to get people in the door to shop.� It's a crapshoot if prescriptions even get filled. Often,��I have to go to the pharmacy 2 or 3 times before I can even pick up routine monthly prescriptions, AND THAT IS EVEN AFTER THEIR SYSTEM HAS ALREADY TEXTED ME THAT THE PRESCRIPTION IS READY.� �Then, after getting CVS's notification text and calling into the pharmacy to speak with someone to make sure my prescription is ready�(believe me, I learned early on how proactively aggressive you need to be in order to pick up even routine monthly prescriptions) they still sometimes never have it.Illustrated example, below.� Sounds completely ridiculous.� 100% true.One of many, many, many, many instances.Me:� "Hi, I'm here to pick up my prescription".(long amount of info giving to get to the point where they can see my prescription).CVS:� "Sorry, I don't see that prescription in our system."(back and forth and back and forth and back and forth, verifying name spelling, prescription spelling, etc, in futile attempt to have them locate the prescription I'm talking about).CVS:� "That prescription is not ready".Me: "What do you mean?� Look, I got this text from CVS saying it's ready and I even called in earlier and spoke to someone at this pharmacy to ensure it was ready and they said yes."�CVS:� "Oh, when they said "ready", they meant ready for you to request�that the prescription be refilled.� We can't refill this prescription without you requesting it."�Me(facepalm):� "Ok, then please refill it.� I'll just shop around until its ready."CVS:� "Sorry.� You have to call in the request to refill.� We can't just take it here".Me: "So you mean call, like I already did earlier today, and request that the prescription be refilled?� I already did that this morning and apparently my asking if my prescription was ready, was not enough of a trigger for the person I spoke with to place the request to refill.� Are you kidding me?� Why didn't this "request to refill" happen then? On top of that, why does CVS send me a text saying my prescription is ready, when "ready" just really means "ready for request to be refilled" but no one explains this nuanced aspect to me and I've been refilling prescriptions here for almost a year and I have got to tell you, that no matter what I do I can't seem to figure out what is needed to get my prescriptions refilled easily.� This is ridiculous. Please just take my verbal request now to refill it.� I'm not stepping out of line to call you on my cell phone.� I just waited in line for 30 minutes."CVS (all frustrated):� "Fine.� We'll just take your request to refill the prescription here, but you have to understand that this is a special exemption, so the next time you need a refill, you'll have to call it in. Hold on, I have to go log into the other system."CVS (takes another 5 minutes to log into a different computer in the next cubicle area and click around in their software):� "Sorry.� We can't fill this prescription today.� We have none in stock and it has to be ordered.� Looks like our supply of this drug has already been ordered and is set to arrive on Tuesday (5 days away)."TUESDAY:Me:� "I'm here to pick up my prescription."(long amount of info giving to get to the point where they can see my prescription).CVS:� "It's not ready".Me:� "What do you mean? I already (long explanation of the rigmarole I've gone through prior) and you said it would arrive on Tuesday so I'm here to pick it up."CVS:� "Yes, our supply arrived today, but your particular prescription hasn't been filled yet.� We can fill it for you now, but it's going to take us at least an hour to fill it because we are in the middle of� doing inventory and can't stop."Me: "Fine. Just fill it, please.� I'll come back in an hour".CVS "Ok.� But you need to know that we close in 45 minutes".(it's like 6 pm)Me:� "......"CVS:� "......"Me:� ".....� is what you are actually saying to me....� is that you are closing in 45 minutes....� but that my prescription refill will take at least an hour....So that means that you are not going to be able to refill my prescription for me today?!?"CVS:� "Yes".This is just one of many examples.� �Sometimes, as a game to entertain myself while in line, I calculate the fill rate of everyone in front of me.� This pharmacy spends more time telling people why they can�t fill their prescriptions than they would if they just actually filled prescriptions like you would expect a pharmacy to do.� No wonder everything takes so long.� One time, I had a 30-minute wait with just 2 people in front of me.�1st�person:� 2 prescriptions � NONE FILLED.� I laughed when he held his phone up to show them his notification text that his prescription was ready.� Newbie.2nd�person:� 3 prescriptions � NONE FILLED.� I felt bad for these two.� They seemed to be picking up prescriptions written after a surgery or something, as they brought in the actual paper prescription and had to go through the LONG process of the pharmacist entering everything, only to tell them that they couldn�t be filled today, for whatever various reason.� And one of the people standing during all of this looked in pain.3rd�person (me):� 2 prescriptions � ONE FILLED.� I was the lucky one.�30 MINUTES; 3 PEOPLE; 1 out of 7 PRESCRIPTIONS FILLED - 14% FILL RATE�This pharmacy is so painstakingly, soul-crushingly awful, that when our insurance open enrollment occurred, my husband�s main and only evaluating point was to choose a plan in which he never had to go to Target CVS pharmacy again.�Me:� �Should we do this plan w/ $2k deductible or $6k HMO?Husband:� �I don�t care.� Does one of those plans allow us to move our prescriptions to Walgreens so I never have to go to Target CVS again?�Me:� �Do you think it's worth buying up for the $25 co-pay?� How many times do you think you go to the doctors in a year?�Husband:� � I don�t know.� Does that plan allow us to refill at Walgreens?� I'll pay anything if I never have to go to Target CVS again�.Me: �Ok, so after I looked at all the plans, the best option for us cost/coverage wise was Plan B�Husband:� �DOES PLAN B ALLOW US TO REFILL PRESCRIPTIONS AT WALGREENS?!?!� THAT�S ALL I CARE ABOUT.� I NEVER WANT TO GO TO TARGET CVS EVER AGAIN!!!!�Me: �Yes�.Husband:� �Ok, good.� Thanks�.�*********************************************I fail at execution though, because my Target CVS novela was too long and I couldn�t actually post the review online, so no one but you get to see how much I detest the Target CVS pharmacy.� That�s not very effective.�Is the hour of my life that I spent this morning lamenting the failings of Target CVS pharmacy, peak privileged people problems? I mean at least I have insurance and can stand in line annoyed with them.*********************************************Credits to Aunt Brie for writing this amazing yet tragic recreation of real-life events. <3

I was driving in the middle lane on a highway at around 100 Kmph, and i see that faar ahead there's these 3  assholes who are riding on one motorcycle and they're lifting up their motorcycle over the sideline coming from a farm and then they go ahead across the road to get to the other side. I slam the brakes with all the power i had and stopped inches away from mowing them down  i roll down my window and shout You Motherfuckers will die like this and as i say it they move ahead to the fast lane and a car crashes right into them, bamm there's blood everywhere one guy falls down right by my door and i get out help him stand up and he smelt like a fucking brewery as i help him stand straight i see there's blood on my windshield but this lucky fellow is unscathed i turn to the road and there's literal brains scrambled on the road one guy is missing half his head other has bones coming out of his right arm and right leg.And as i process this accident some random onlooker comes about and snatches my car keys saying he'll call the police i say i didn't them that car did the car that hit them is now nowhere to be seen because hey it's hit and run not hit and face the consequences. So i drag him to the front of my car and ask him does to have a look at my car and tell me if it looks i hit them? He apologizes gives me the keys i fuck off from there. Hours later cops show up tell me the guy has been arrested, take my statement  and that's the end of this story. Since it's India it'll take years for the trial to begin and I'm supposed to testify in court as to what happened.

Back in 7th grade I had an Aquantince lets call her Karen we didn't talk much but we knew each other existed. Let's note that this girl isn't very bright. So one afternoon in English were were finishing up a book were when I asked Karen for a pencil, she hands me a friction activated color changing pencil. Of course I was amazed by it, I rub it up and down as the color changed I return it  to her after class ended. In a later period I was called into the office for "makeing sexual gestures to a female" I explained the situation and they checked the cameras to verify. Karen Reported me to the dean. Later in the day I asked her about it and she insisted that I "wanted to get with her " (I WAS 12) so I said I don't, shrugged it off ,and mined my business when I was called into the office AGAIN the dean gave the same speal about me harassing women again I denied it ,he then checked the cameras, because it was passing period the hallways were loud and it was almost impossible to hear our conversation so she called Karen into the office to explain what happened she told her story of how I was trying to get with her while I still denied it at this point both our parents were called and when my mother insists on a court case, Karen give everything up and says it's a lie she gets oss and everything is solved until about a mother later I get a note in class saying "I like you- Karen "  Let's just say I played with her heart and when she wanted to "come over " I gave her the address to my old apartment complex (about an hour walk from where she lives) she got pissed and later cursed me out in school and eventually ended up moving to an all girl military school.

One night I had a horrible case of insomnia. I was too tired to do anything and I couldn�t go to sleep. I took a shot of z-quil at 10:00pm, and then another at 2:00am. Of course when I got to school that�s when it started to hit me. I was so tired that walking took a lot of energy. I met 2 of my friends outside of school and told them how tired I was. My friend Tyler said �Dude, have my Monster. It�ll wake you up!� I never really had an energy drink up to this point. He gave me one of those big monsters with the screw on cap. I slammed it. I went from thanking him to being home, 8 1/2 hours later. One minute it was 7:30am, next minute it was 4:00pm. I didn�t remember a thing. I asked a few people how I was the next day and they told me I was in auto-pilot. Giving very short, dead end responses and ignoring people. I wouldn�t try it again because I think I can safely assume that THAT is not healthy.

Ok, so I guess this sounds a bit strange, but I genuinely love to watch my husband sleep.He is an EMT and works 12-16hours shifts, so most nights he comes home so exhausted that he barely gets his boots off before he�s asleep.When he is asleep, it just reminds me of the depth of our love in so many little ways. He has a tendency to toss and turn lately, but he always reaches out towards me, ready to have his arm around me. Even dead asleep, if I shift in the bed, he moves alongside me, as if we�re tied together. He�s an incredibly sound sleeper, too. He never wakes up when I brush his hair from his eyes, or kiss him softly, but when I whisper that I love him, he always sleepily murmurs back �I love you too, baby.�So much can change in a relationship over time, and it�s just so wonderful to know that nothing can change our love for one another. I stay beside him all night, the familiar rhythm of his quiet snores seem to be the only peace that I know now.Every morning when he wakes up, it always startles me just a bit. In the first few sleepy moments, we just smile at each other, holding onto the warmth of each other�s presence for a moment longer. Then he gets up and dressed, ready for another long day, and he kisses his fingers and reaches down to place the kiss on the cool glass of our wedding photo and says �I love you, baby,� his voice so warm and sad.We only had 5 years together before the cancer separated us, but I know our love is what keeps me here. I love to watch my husband sleep.

Welp, first post and it�s gonna be about me being kind of a jerk. Alright, let�s take it back about three years ago. I just finished putting in a few applications for a couple jobs and decided to go get something to eat because I had to walk about 20 minutes to each place. I stop at a McDonald�s because it was cheap and I had no energy to go somewhere healthier. Walking through the parking lot, I saw it was absolutely packed with cars. Kinda like when they were doing the Szechuan Sauce thing but no screams of �Pickle Rick� were heard this time. Since it was a Friday and around the time a nearby elementary school got out, I figured these were parents taking their kids to go eat, but when I walk inside, there is not one person in the main area. At all. Kinda like the Apocalypse just started and everyone got raptured. So I call out to the silence �Hello?� No answer. And as I�m turning to leave, thinking something�s gone way wrong, this woman appears out of thin air behind me. (You know Joo Dee from Avatar? Imagine that level of creepy.) She says �Hi there!� In about as annoying of a voice you�d think and starts sizing me up looking for something. Before I can say anything she says �So where�s Tammy�s present?� (Might�ve been Tina, I dunno.) Once I tell her I don�t have one, she points to the door behind her and says �Well you can leave then.� Naturally I take this as a joke because...well...hungry. So with the dots connected I try to laugh it off and as I turn around to go wait for an employee to show up, she steps in front of me and does a cross between a �Mom-Bar� and a Stiff Arm. I could�ve left but I just had to ask �Are you serious?� And she launches into a torrent of �Private Party� this and �disrespectful� that, during which a worker finally comes half to my rescue by simply shouting �How can I help you?!� I say my order only to get shouted over by this very angry mother. After maybe three minutes of ear piercing screaming, the birthday entourage of about 12 parents and 20 kids come in from the Play Place of Hell only to see me sitting in a booth with the birthday girl�s mom giving me the business. One of the parents does that �You�re being an ass� throat clear and she turns around and the birthday girl, tiara, dress and all says �Mommy, why are you yelling at that person?� And the mother starts stammering for words. Obviously she can�t bring herself to say �Oh our private party in a damn McDonald�s was so rudely interrupted by someone who was hungry of all things!� So I decide to give her a hand and say �She was just telling me how excited she was to get each of you 20 NUGGETS.� Turns out, kids go ape-shit for McNuggets. Like. Damn. Even some of the parents were kinda hype. But it all ends quick as the birthday mother says loudly and slowly �NO ONE is getting Nuggets.� First a sob, then a cry then about 16-17 full blown tantrums break out. Nuggets were (falsely) promised and now their dreams are in shambles. One kid threw napkins, another started throwing presents. In the chaos I ran to the counter where my food was waiting for me. I quickly paid and tore out of McDonald�s faster than I ever have before. On the way out I heard three parents yelling �Put the cake down!� I can only assume the many screams I heard were someone putting the cake down...on the floor. Well I hope this isn�t too wall of text-ish, but if it gets taken down, so be it. Moral of the story? Do not. Lie. About. Nuggets.

When I was 4, my cousin decided to marry a Muslim woman, our Christian society, being a religious minority in an Islamic country, rejected his decision and his family banished him; He was denied to visit his brothers and sisters, his father revoked his right to his future share of inheritance, as the law of our country required, he was forced to change his name and live in solitude (except for his new family, which I have never met), and when his father died of diabetes in the age of 80, all the blame for his death was cast upon his converted son.  As I grew up under the shadow of my bigger cousin, I learned that he was the top student in the top university in my country (engineering), he was a professional climber and socially very active, which was exactly what I have become (except I am a medical doctor). Then I, too, met a wonderful woman who put me in front of the same decision, to marry a person with a different religious background and become the source of my parents misery, or try again and be the one who made the whole family proud. I don't know what the first decision would bring to my life, but after 10 years of making the second decision, I like to make an apology and a statement to two people who are unfortunately not part of my life:To my cousin; I am proud of your bravery, I wish I could meet you someday. If there is a "wrong" decision, it is not yours. I like you to know the same family also put the blame of my father's death on me, because I put him "through excessive stress" by not marrying a "suitable" woman in time (he died of cancer). I should have known better that traditions should not decide instead of you.To the woman I shared my feelings and later decided not to join her when she left the country: I am sorry, I wasted your time and your first experience of love, I should have never shared my feelings with you if I was not sure of myself. You deserve all the love that life has to offer.

 Recently I overheard a father and daughter in their last moments together at the airport. They had announced the departure.Standing near the security gate, they hugged and the father said, 'I love you, and I wish you enough.'The daughter replied, 'Dad, our life together has been more than enough. Your love is all I ever needed. I wish you enough, too, Dad.'They kissed and the daughter left. The Father walked over to the window where I was seated. Standing there I could see he wanted and needed to cry. I tried not to intrude on his privacy, but he welcomed me in by asking, 'Did you ever say good-bye to someone knowing it would be forever?''Yes, I have,' I replied. 'Forgive me for asking, but why is this a forever good-bye?'..'I am old, and she lives so far away. I have challenges ahead and the reality is - the next trip back will be for my funeral,' he said.'When you were saying good-bye, I heard you say, 'I wish you enough..' May I ask what that means?'He began to smile. 'That's a wish that has been handed down from other generations. My parents used to say it to everyone...'He paused a moment and looked up as if trying to remember it in detail, and he smiled even more. 'When we said, 'I wish you enough,' we were wanting the other person to have a life filled with just enough good things to sustain them.' Then turning toward me, he shared the following as if he were reciting it from memory.I wish you enough sun to keep your attitude bright no matter how gray the day may appear.I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun even more.  I wish you enough happiness to keep your spirit alive and everlasting.I wish you enough pain so that even the smallest of joys in life may appear bigger.I wish you enough gain to satisfy your wanting.  I wish you enough loss to appreciate all that you possess.I wish you enough hellos to get you through the final good-bye.He then began to cry and walked away.They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them; but then an entire life to forget them.  Only if you wish, send this to the people you will never forget. If you don't send it to anyone it may mean that you are in such a hurry that you have forgotten your friends.\*TAKE TIME TO LIVE....\*To all who took the time to read this - \*I WISH YOU ENOUGH\*. By Bob Perks. Wish it was mine but it touched my heart and I felt compelled to share.this might be the closure that you need to find peace. It was for me.

My gf and I were just hanging out in my living room watching tv or on our phones. She showed me a �no homo� meme and because I enjoy those, I gave it a good laugh. After a bit, my gf asked if she could go to my room and get one of my hoodies. I told her yes and she went upstairs. She was gone for a while and when she came back she was wearing one of my hoodies that was wayyy to big on her, a pair of jeans that were nearly falling off of her, and one of my caps. She had her hair tucked into the cap and straight up pretended she was a gay boi. She was being really flirty and calling me �bro� in a deep voice and getting handsy. She leaned on the wall with her arm and said something like �C�mon bro, lets go upstairs, no homo� then the pair of jeans she was wearing plopped to the ground because they were too big for her. She got embarrassed and I couldn�t stop laughing. She laughed with me then after we settled down I let her spend the rest day like that. Tho I hate to admit it, this made me feel some type of way. I kinda questioned my sexuality after this. I may very well like boys tooI�ll be honest, she makes for a pretty cute boy. Next time we do the do I plan to tell her to dress like a boy. God what�s happened to me. xd

Back in high school we had a lot of problems with drugs in the bathrooms. The principal knew me because he was friends with my parents and one day called me down to the office.He told me that every person I saw doing drugs in the bathroom and reported to him he would pay me 20 dollars. By the end of the year I had amounted around 300 dollars. And the best part was he never told anyone else about it so none of my friends knew I was selling out people in my school.it still brings a smile to my face.

It was December 2019. I was walking out of a Walmart in a small city. Carrying my bags outside,  since this Walmart was in walking distance of my apartment (about 8 blocks), I headed home. Since it was in a city (I don't live there anymore) there was one sketchy block. I didn't pay any mind to it as per usual and tried to move across the block as quickly as I could.  However, a huge man with neck tattoos and muscles twice as large as mine forcibly knocked into me from behind and dragged me into an alley way by my legs. He then exclaims in a monotone, but quiet voice "Give me all your fucking shit, motherfucker." I explain to him that I don't have cash on me, and had just used a credit card to pay for my groceries. He forcibly shook me down and hammered me with his gigantic fists. Out of desperation, I screamed into my phone "Hey Siri, play Bad Guy by Billie Ellish." The meathead scrambled out of the alley and took off at a full sprint with his ears plugged. After he was gone, I told Siri to turn that shit off. Although I escaped with my life, I still have mental scarring from having to listen to that shitty music.

Okay, first I�ll tell you the backstory of all this. I�m a 19 year old female and a cosplayer. On saturday I was on a convention, cosplaying Sal Fisher. I bought a pair of red jeans for him a few months ago and only got to wear it 2 times or so. I washed it a few time before as well. Keep this in mind.So on sunday I noticed that my legs were blue after taking a shower. I was kind of in a panic since y�know you always expect the worse.So yesterday, on monday I showed my colleagues my blue legs, and they immediately sent me to our company doctor.Company doctor looked at it and said it�s probably a circulation disorder, and went ahead to send me to my normal doctor.After work I went to my normal doctor, which also looked at my legs and immediately sent me to a vascular surgeon. I started to panic even more, obviously because my legs were BLUE and every single person I showed my legs were having that: �Oh heck what are we supposed to do� look in their eyes.So today I went to the vascular surgeon, I didn�t even have to wait 10 minutes because it was an emergency. The doctor did an ultra sound of my leg veins and arteries, and looked at my aorta. Everything was fine. So of course I�m starting to get even more worried because the only option left is a heart disorder or something. So the doctor calls in her boss, he looked at it and asked me if I got any new clothing recently. I told him about the red jeans I bought for Sal but I wore and washed it before.And..then he took an alcohol wipe and wiped over my leg once. And all of the blue colour was gone.Basically my RED jeans tinted my legs BLUE. And that was the story of how I scared everyone of my family, friends, colleagues and doctors almost to death because of a pair of jeans.

About a year ago this guy punched me in the face so hard, my glasses broke and a chip stabbed me in the eye. My family (I was 15 at the time) sued them and they had to pay for my laser eye surgery, which costed 50,000 dollars. I guess I feel a bit remorseful, but teaches him not to punch anybody again. Also, I would�ve been permanantly blinded without the surgery.

Today I was eating with my nephew. I gave him a little bit of cranberry juice because he's never tasted it before. Then when he takes a sip he says...this tastes just like skeletons. When I asked him why he just started laughing lol. Note, he's only 2 yrs old.

Dec 31 2019Playing left for dead when i see my little brothers face drop. My brother and I thought we heard knocking when screams popped in my head in which made me dash to turn off the lights,duck down, and breathe heavily. I live in a gang like city so i usually Don't think of it as to much but the screams made me think what if i die. As i go to my room I realize its new years. I have no family to treat me to a nice dinner or barbeque with music. It feels like a normal day.Moral:  i shouldn't stay playing L4D for hours...

That reminds me of a story. The company for which I am Subsurface Manager was befallen unto by a series of fortunate events. We had exclusive exploration and production rights to three blocks in a certain Middle Eastern country not well known for their oil or gas production. Oh, sure, they did have some O&G production, but it paled in comparison to some of the more egregiously unctuous locales in the region. However, with cunning, cleverness and a surfeit of grinning of the various gods of petroleum, we made several significant, and more importantly, ridiculously profitable, discoveries. But all was not skittles and beer. These discoveries were made in reservoirs that were rather deep, highly pressured and would just as soon take your head off rather than say �good morning�. These were oil discoveries (odd, given the 5,000m depth � it�s all down to a low geothermal gradient, but I�ll spare you the geological and geodynamic science of that particular phenomena), and thankfully lacked heavy metals, waxes, and noxious gasses (particularly hydrogen sulfide (H2S) which will kill you at concentrations above 0.15% vol). They did, however, require some fairly serious (read: expensive) kit just to reach them and do all the needful to make them relinquish their subterranean treasures. This meant that for developing the fields, we needed a couple of fairly rare, very large 3,500 HP top-drive drilling rigs, specially-designed metallurgy drill pipe, stout bits, exotic muds, huge mud pumps, unusual (as in not usually found at Sneed�s Rigs, Seed and Feed) (formerly Chuck�s)) completion downhole jewelry and the like. All of which was in exactly zero supply in the place where we needed to drill; and not even available in the entire region.So, as being the only Norteamericano available, I was duly elected to fly to certain Texas facility to negotiate the vendage of some of their more stalwart drilling accouterments. Therefore, I curtailed my petroleum geological activities, sallied forth and found myself, a couple of days later, wandering around a very large and sunny sandlot chock-a-block with all forms various and sundry of the tools of my trade.  As this was a business trip, I was nominally kitted out in appropriate business apparel: size 16 Vasque field boots, chinos, a loose flannel shirt over a well-worn �Subduct Illinois� T-shirt, my usual gloves (from another tale of oil rig incidents) and new Cavender's Stetson. Truth be told, with my Grizzly Adams-style beard, forgotten last haircut and ever present cigar, I probably did more resemble an aging floor-hand rather than a customer with a rhodium American Express card and a high 8-figure line of credit. However, who buys a new car without kicking the tires a few times? I was up on every rig floor�I�ve done business with these characters numerous times over the last near 4-decades of working the Oil Patch; so to them, I was the personification of the auspicious arrival of a Chicken Delight truck to a famished beach party. I�m frugal as hell with my own finances, but damn, I sure do like spending other people�s money.I had a 6-page shopping list and was out in the lot scouting for the best deals as well as the best equipment that I was to have shipped back over to our particular slice o� heaven. The proprietor�s salesmen would normally be walking me around the joint, pointing out how I just had to have �this�, and �that�, and �Oh, hell, you simply must get the other thing�. I knew my way around quite well, thank you, and didn�t desire nor require some wonko salesman blathering in my ear while I tried to put together the needed necessary necessities. To my ever persistent sales weevil: �Nah, that�s OK, You just fuck off now and let me take in some inventory.��OK, yeah, Ok. If you need anything, just call me at �.��Fine, I need some cold beer and a bottle of Stoli. Just make sure they�re waiting at the office when I finish up here. Do that, and I�ll be sure to get your name on the sales receipt.� As they all work commission. With visions of superfluity dancing in his head, he quickly departs for a Sam�s Warehouse so he�ll be ready when I make my decisions. I climb up on the drill floor of a particularly natty-looking National 1650 rig. Certified, lightly used, but well broken-in, solid draw works, 2.5 million pound hook load��HEY! I need some help here! Where the fuck are you?� came a voice from somewhere south of my current location. I lean over the railing and see some sort of ill-fitting suit-wearing character, glowing positively crimson and gormless in the sweltering Texas noonday sun.�Hello. Hullo! What�s up? What�s new?� I holler back.�God damn it. I need to find some <arglebargle garbled description> in this fucking junkyard. Get down here and show me. NOW!�Even though I don�t work here nor am I easily offended, but to call this hallowed bastion of drilling and exploration a �junkyard� is industrialized blasphemy and assholitry of the first water. I cheerfully reply to this meathead: �They don�t have any of that here. Fuck off, go to Pecos.��What? What the fuck did you say?� he bellows back.�Are you deaf as well as stupid? Piss off.��What? I�ll have your job!!!�Inevitable. You are nowhere nearly enough evolved�I take my time and stroll around the rig floor, and down the ladders. I light up a new cigar so I can be just as offensive as possible and confront Mr. Shiny Suit. �So, what�s your major malfunction, Chuckles?��WhAT? What the fuck�who� where���Let�s not forget �why� and �when�.��What the fuck you talkin� about?��Odd, I thought you might know. Sorry about the confusion. Was the llama red or green?�I was always taught that if you couldn�t say something nice, say something surreal. Shiny-Suit continues: �Look, asshole. I need���Half a mo, Guv. I don�t work here. Do I look like someone that works in a rig yard?��Oh, fuck all that. You do so work here, I saw you up on those rigs. Now listen up, I need��Once more, with feeling: �OK, look here, Herr Mac. I don�t work here, I�m a customer just like�well, exactly nothing like you as I know what I need���Don�t give me that shit, look at you. Clipboard, boots, hat�tell me you don�t work here.�I know a lost cause when I hear one, so I decide that I�ve already got a good idea of what I�m going to purchase, so I�d maybe harass this goof for some shits and giggles.�Yeah, fine. Don�t listen. Whaddya need?��Well�, puffing himself out like a peacock in a henhouse, �I�m the Vice President of Whogivesafuck Oil and Gas and I need some DC-powered 3.5� downhole yellion-contmenneckors�� �Prejaculated, goropreemic, or neodetented?��Umm�ah�the first one.��Sorry, fresh out. The truck will be here next Tuesday.��Oh. OK, How about heavyweight drill collars?��Monel, duraluminum or chromolybdenum? �Umm�ah�I�ll have to check.�Do that. Thinking that I�ve had more than enough fun for one day, I reply: �Well, I�m off; I have a thing. Someone�ll be in the yard though if you need more help.�I turn to wander off and this asswipe has the impudence to seize me by the shoulder and try to spin me around. Bad move. Very bad career move.I came within an angstrom unit or two of just Hapkido-ing this idiot into next week, but pity stayed my hand. �It�s a pity it�s so damned hot out here today.�I instead growled as I exhaled a large blue Maduro-smoke cloud toward his greasy mug and informed him that if he ever tried that again, he�d end up minus a few necessary parts.�What? You threatening me?�I rip off my left glove and shove what�s left of my hand (1 thumb, 1 pinky finger and a mass of keloids) up under his porcine proboscis and inform him: �This is what happened to me the last time. The other guy didn�t look nearly so good.��Sorry. I didn�t know. I didn�t mean��Replacing my gloves: �Yeah, how could you. Now, I don�t work here. Got that?��But I need���Then go find someone who actually does work here.��But you�re already here and it�s so hot and I need��Malevolently, a nasty thought crosses my mind whilst a nasty Grinch-grin crosses my face: �So, give me a little background. What are you doing? That way maybe I can direct you to what you�ll need.�I�ll spare you the gory details, but this nitwit lays out his company�s complete exploration plan. Everything; the whole enchilada, in 3-part harmony. This is exceedingly ill-advised as the oil industry is nothing if not ridiculously competitive and sworn secrecy is the norm. He could have couched his little tale with vague and incongruent details, but no. He lays it all out, including the fact that they were shopping for their own rig so they could drill prospects themselves as they �didn�t trust any drilling company with their secrets�. He also let it slip that they had only obtained the deep mineral rights for their prospects (there�s such a thing as �depth severancing�: where one company can have the rights from surface to 5,000�, another from 5,000� to 10,000�, etc., so several companies can hold certain depth mineral rights to one singular piece of property) and that they were going to save a bundle not logging the shallow parts of their wells. �Do go on. Tell me more.�So, while we wandered around this huge sandlot, getting more and more dehydrated, I finally tote up all the equipment I�m going to need. In the interim I show Herr Shiny Suit where the paraphernalia he needs is currently residing. Did I mention that I have lived in a desert country for the past 15 years and know the value of hydration? I do, Herr Shiny Suit did neither. During our perambulations, I�d quickly nip off to one of the many water stations dotting the landscape (usually behind a large hunk of machinery) that are rather well camouflaged. Out of sight, I�d slurp down a liter or so of cold, clear Brazos branch only to rejoin Mr. Shiny Suit as he progressively grew more and more heated and desiccated. At first, I asked him if he wanted something to drink but his pride and obliviousness precluded him showing any sort of softness; I mean, I�m not a total savage here. So, I dragged him up one aisle and down the other. It was undeniably hot that day. �But at least it�s a dry heat�, he remarked. �So�s a bonfire.�Finally, he starts to complain of cramps and that he�s just gone cold. Hyperthermia and dehydration. This guy may be a knuckle-dragging knee-walking turkey, but even that is no grounds for negligent homicide.I call my sales-wonk and tell him we need an immediate pickup out near the blue National 1650; that I�ve got some idiot that can�t plan and doesn�t respect the climate whose about to go tits-up.Back in the shop, I drop Herr Shiny Suit in the air-conditioned office as I hand my list off to the salesman so he can total up the damages. Looking around expectantly, I remark: �Well, isn�t this just dandy? My signing hand is all knotted up and there�s nothing to help relieve the cramps��Herr Salesman chuckles, and opens what appears to be a closet door to display an impromptu open bar replete with ice-buckets full of longnecks and a rather attractive assortment of high-octane potables. �Well, how about that? My hand�s feeling better already��I drain a few longnecks (be all the beer-snob you want; but a frosty, icy Lone Star or nine certainly does cut the dust). Just add a few hundred milliliters of good Russian vodka, and you�ve really got yourself some tasty and much needed hydration*. (*Yes, I know that alcoholic beverages are bad for hydration, but this is my story. So there.)Since I�m dropping a few rather tall piles of greenbacks for this little (actually about $23.5MM since I negotiated a good lend-lease sort of arrangement) deal, word has gotten out and the entire office decides to join in the fun and dream their little dreamy dreams of unbridled avarice. They know that I could go just about anywhere in oil country and source my company�s requirements; but loyalty is justly rewarded. And that, gangaroos, goes both ways. Like peripatetic leeches, as word gets out about the big sale, various forms of OFT (Oil Field Trash�said with reverence, as I�m a card-carrying emeritus member) drift in to see what all the hoo-ha was about and partake of some free libations. Herr Shiny Suit regains some moiety of his marbles and even with being some whoop-de-doo fucking VP of one or another who-gives-a-rat�s-ass oil company; free booze is free booze. I�m chuckling it up with some of the local operators; most whom I have known from years before I went overseas and did the Expat thing. Longnecks were popped and drained, cigars appeared, and conviviality flowed like 41-gravity API crude on a leasehold. Herr Shiny Suit, irritated and getting quite readily plowed due to heat exhaustion and low tolerance, resented that I seemed to be the center of attention and puffed himself up with gales of self-importance. He waddles over to a group of us relating tales of the rotary table, and forces himself into the conversation: �I�m Joe Palooka III, VP of Whogivesafuck Oil and Gas; now listen here��The whole group, as a man, snort, sneer, and start making for the bar when a glint comes to my eye: �Gents. Some decorum, please. Listen to Mr. the IIIrd here. He�ll tell you all about the project he�s sourcing here�� Wink, wink, nudge, nudge�Puffed up with bumptiousness and free hooch, he launches into the most detailed and self-congratulatory tale of how he built this company up from nothing, drilled discovery after discovery and what their plans were once he secures the necessary drilling materials. All the other local operators just grin and take notes. Once back in the Middle East, awaiting delivery of our drilling and completion paraphernalia, I get an Email from one of the local operators who was present at the aforementioned soiree. Seems he was able to take a top-lease over Herr Shiny Suit�s prospects and they just made a couple of nice, shallow discoveries. The deep prospects didn�t pan out unfortunately, but for the price of $50/acre and a 1/16th royalty, he essentially got another oil company to drill a couple of free wells for them. To this day, Herr VP Shiny Suit cannot figure out how someone got in and snaked the shallow rights out from under him�TL; DR: Don�t be a dick in the Oil Patch especially if you can�t hold your free liquor.

I was in Uzbekistan (Tashkent) trying to flog some oil deals back in 1991. Having Russian ties due to some deals we engineered for Mother Russia in the turbulent span from 1988-1991, we had access to the higher-up muckety-mucks in the fledgling Uzbek government. The country only recently had become independent, had rampant inflation and they were anxious for Western oil deals (slathering for them actually) so my little cabal of Houston-based oil types were treated like royalty. We flew into Tashkent (we were some of the first Western industrial scientists allowed in country, much as the situation we enjoyed back in the Rodina in 1987), and were greeted by a fleet of absolutely decrepit UAZ 4WD microbuses. These were the few the government could throw together for us visiting VIPs. Whereupon, they took a group of heavily jet-lagged and pretty-much-still-drunk-if-not-suffering-from-near-fatal-hangovers (old habits die hard in this geologist's camp) on a 4-day tour of their wonderful (and I do mean that) country. UAZ 4WD gun-metal-gray vehicles are pretty much the workhorse of the FSU's (Former Soviet Union's) military, sort of like the Jeep was for the US; and equally as well outfitted with the opulence of 1/4-inch thick foam pads over the cold-rolled and cold-welded steel pipe that passed for seats. Heaters existed, but with only 2 settings: "Off" and "Chernobyl". Most were stuck in the latter position and not greatly appreciated in this desert country in August. Let's just say, they were a bit rough around the edges and they were all edges. After bopping around the whole country from Karakalpakstan, to the Chardzhou Step, to Gazli and Bukhara Fields, to the Afghan border, Zarafshan, Samarkand, Jizzax, and finally to the verdence of the Vale of Fergana (the Fergana Basin), where the main offices of the Uzbek National Oil Company were located.   We were bivouacked in the Geophysical Department (where absolutely ancient Ghazhel Seismographs were skidded out of the way to make way for our cots), and bid to come to a banquet dinner in our honor.  Remember the jet-lagged, hung-over and fair to moderately trashed Westerners at the outset of all this? Still here; but now a bunch of road-weary, jet-lagged, insomniac, hung-over (they keep giving us bottles of Russkaya vodka and Bei Aice cognac, but every one of those bottles had holes in them...) and seriously sideways Westerners.We drag our weary carcasses to the banquet hall and were greeted with an opulence of plof (a rice dish), shashlyk (mutton shish kabob), horse sausage, a galaxy of fresh fruit, whole barbequed lamb and more vodka, beer and cognac than usually found in a 1960's fraternity. After 3 or 4 hours of this, we all beg off citing a distinct need for sleep. Unfortunately, the collusion between alcohol, megacalories and jet-lag produced an insolvable case of mass insomnia. So we drag a few chairs outside, and I produce cigars for all. The tea boys of the oil company see us and drag tables out where we were congregated; suddenly ashtrays, vodka, beer and cognac (and the always accompanying sliced cucumber and melon) appear. I look at my watch and note its 2:00, having no idea if that was AM or PM. So, here's a bunch of completely done-in Westerners (who spoke absolutely no Uzbek and rather sketchy Russian) sitting around at 2 in the morning smoking, drinking and acting generally like degenerate troublemakers in front of the government offices. When the police arrive. "What's all this then?" or the Uzbek equivalent.We all give our best "we're only a bunch of inebriated idiots, no danger to anyone" smiles and nervously converse amongst ourselves: "Now what the fuck do we do?"Luckily, our sponsor shows up and explains that there's absolutely nothing untoward going on, we were Western "VIPs" and should be treated with respect, yadda...yadda...yadda.There were 2 police officers, one short (compared to us corn-fed lummoxes) and the other shorter. They exchanged curious glances, argued back and forth and just when I thought it might be prudent for a strategic retreat, our sponsor offers the officers to partake of our table full of potables and join our little impromptu party. They stopped and glanced at the bottles but positively leer at the 60 ring double maduro Churchill cigar on which we're all chomping. Free booze is a good social lubricant, but free (and Western) tobacco is a passport to gaining a new friend for life. "Care for a smoke?", I ask them, brandishing a brace of dark-brown torpedoes. Suddenly, bilingualism erupts as these two are quite capable in English and instantly accept my offer and the offer of our sponsor as well. Well, after 3 hours, more than a few bottles of hooch and an equal number of cigars later Officer Best Friend For Life #1 and #2 grumble that they have to be off and complete their patrol.  They wandered generally street-ward , turned and asked if we'd like to come along and see the city from their perspective."Fuck yeah!". Let's go on patrol with the local constabulary. So we all join our new friends, everyone pretty well loaded and strolling around the city center and back warrens smoking huge cigars. It was like a scene from some long forgotten 'Keystone Cops Go East' movie. I'm walking alongside Husan (Officer #1; Officer #2's name was AbdulAziz), and note I'm easily a foot or so taller and 100 or so pounds heavier than he. So, I ask: "Husan, just asking, what you would have done if we were actually bad guys back there?"He smiles a crooked grin and in a flash, I'm staring down the barrel of a Makarov PMM, 10x18 version. Basically, it was like looking down a tunnel hoping the train was going to be late. "Very good gun. Russian, but we will make our own someday." Husan intones.I tell him that I collect large caliber weapons and complement him on his sidearm. "Let me show you..." as he skitters off down an empty lot, sets up a couple of likely targets, and sidles back to our bewildered group. "You're not going to..." Blam. blam. blam. Three shots ring out and 3 bottles downrange evaporate. He yells something to AbdulAziz who takes off and scrounges some more targets. Husan hands me the gun and wants to see how good is the Westerner's aim. Truth be told, I probably shouldn't have been able to hit the backside of a bordello, but luckily, the shockwaves of this cannon were enough to at least knock over 2 bottles. All this at 0600 in a far and distant and very curious land.Much laughter, much more shooting and a box of cigars later, I'm the proud owner of an Uzbek Makarok PMM. Husan refuses any sort of cash, and shrugs off the loss of a sidearm. "We have many guns. We need friends now more." We always laugh about this goofy introduction when I visit Captain Husan and his family.

In my first year of college, I made friends with a girl, let�s call her Bec. Bec was fun and we enjoyed much of the same things; coffee, caring for others, procrastination, plants and a good meme. We both needed to move to another campus for the second half of our degrees so we planned to move into the dorms together. I began to notice that Bec was quite an emotional person. She felt sad a lot and had previously attempted suicide, She struggled with her weight and moving meant giving up her current job. We planned and obsessed. We relied on each other for everything. Bec began to sleep around with boys she met on tinder and would constantly get her heart stomped into the ground. I tried to help, I gave her my shoulder to cry on and gave her some gentle advice, but she would never listen. It was exhausting.She started to spiral - failing exams, getting drunk every weekend, and being rude/dismissive of my feelings. It seemed that every issue I had that was hurting me was a blip in the universe in comparison to her gigantic issues. I felt like her Psychologist instead of her friend. I encouraged her to seek professional help but she didn�t want to.She started saying things to other people behind my back and being rude to me despite everything I was doing for her. So when it came to actually moving I wasn�t sure any more. I tried to make different plans but it was too late. I was stuck with her.We moved into dorms and it was a few months of sobbing in my room because of how horrible this girl made me feel, and how homesick I was.I am financially independent but Bec is not. She expected me to shout her food and coffee etc. when we were out because I earned more money than her. I felt used and so tired. Eventually I started making new friends. I made friends with a girl who was so kind to me, her name shall be Lara. Lara was a give and take type of person and we began hanging out more and more. She suggested moving out together so we started looking with some other friends of hers. I hid all of this from Bec because she was very jealous and manipulative. Everything I did supposedly affected her. So I kept it hidden until we found a place and had our application approved.The day I told her, she put 5-7 of her blood pressure medication in her mouth (dangerous) and went to swallow before I told her to spit them out. She wrapped things around her throat and when I called the mental health line she hit me multiple times and screamed at me. She told me that it was selfish for me to leave and used multiple guilt tripping tactics all of which pushed me further away.I even called her parents to tell them what was happening and that they should come be with their daughter.Before moving she tried to guilt trip Lara saying that she was stealing me away from her and we reassured her by saying she could visit whenever she wanted.Bec has talked to me maybe 3 times since this incident (one of which she threatened to never talk to me again if I didn�t make her a bridesmaid someday). Bec told a mutual friend that she hated me but honestly I don�t know if I trust said mutual friend either.Lara and I are still good friends and we treat each other like family.I don�t miss Bec, And I don�t miss the drama. I left and I never looked back. I am so much happier here than ever before.

I was about 13/14 years old and I didn't have very many friends. I would hang out with a fairly large group at school during lunch. We all would hang out during lunchtime outside and would joke around like teenagers do. But one day near the end of the school year, all of my friends kinda grouped around me and my one friend basically told me that none of them wanted to be my friends anymore. They had some weird reasoning too. They said that I would bring up jokes and conversations that were old. Like what does that even mean?! So after that I sat by myself for the last week of school that we had.At first I really didn't know what to think, I thought it was weird but didn't think much else about it. Until I told other people when I was older and I realized how messed up it really was.

******************************



I'm a 32 year old man. During my junior year of high school, I had what probably amounted to the most traumatizing experience of my life. Even to this day, I still get a sickening feeling in my stomach everytime I look back on it.For a bit of context, I have 3 older siblings. My eldest one, and the one most relevant to this story, is my sister whom I will name �Ava� for the sake of anonymity. Ava is over 14 years my senior. As a result of the rather large generation gap, for a while, our relationship was more �aunt/nephew� rather than �brother/sister�. During most of my early childhood, she absolutely dotted on me. For example, she purchased everything that I ever wanted...even if our parents didn�t approve. At one point, she even got me a dog while my parents were on a business trip, without them knowing. We drifted apart when she left for college. Her college was located several states away from our family�s hometown. Other than some occasional phone calls and her coming home for the holidays, we didn�t have much contact. It didn�t help that were in very different stages in life. After she completed her college education and got her master�s degree, she moved back to our hometown. Ava quickly got a job as an English teacher at the local high school. Funny enough, she ended up being my English teacher in my Sophomore and Junior years of high school.Ava was extremely beautiful and charismatic. She was like the Scarlett Johansson of our small town. Everyone around her agreed that she had this incredibly powerful aura around her. She was also very outgoing and ambitious. One of her goals in life was to ensure that students receive a proper education. Hence why she chose to be a teacher.Unknown to most everyone, with the exception of her closest family members, she had her own inner demons. While she looked confident and appeared to have everything going for her on the outside, Ava was in truth deeply insecure. Her insecurities had led down to some fairly dark paths in her life. She had a drug addiction that Ava battled for years, and she suffered from a serious case of depression that she fought tooth and nail to keep hidden underneath a mask. Worst of all, her desperate desire for romantic relationships and affection have led her to become trapped in a series of failing and occasionally abusive relationships. The worst of her exes was a guy whom I will call Charlie. He was a single father and a pawnshop owner in his late thirties. For some background on the guy, he and his children were some Scottish immigrants that moved to our small town half a decade prior of this story�s incident. As far as I heard, he divorced his wife prior to moving to the US. I had a crush on his eldest daughter (who will be named Luna in this story), who was in my grade. Luna will become very important later in this story. At that point in her life, Ava has recently finalized her emotional rollercoaster of a divorce with her first husband. The bitter battle for custody had emotionally drained her, and she wanted a fresh start in life. As Charlie was a divorced parent himself, she could really relate to him. She also enjoyed the attention that he gave her, and seemed like a nice guy at the time. After 4 or 5 dates, they officially entered in a relationship.Charlie was extremely possessive and controlling of my sister. He would demand to know Ava�s every move, and would get enraged every time she talked to another guy. One time, Charlie had a total meltdown when he witnessed Ava chatting with our brother Lido. I got a horrible vibe from the guy, and our parents really despised him. Slowly growing tired of Charlie�s behavior, Ava started to question their relationship. The last straw was when Ava caught Charlie cheating on her. She confronted him about it, and he physically attacked her. Fortunately, she escaped with nothing more serious than a few bruises. As you might expect, Ava dumped him on the spot. Charlie couldn�t take Ava leaving him, and he resorted to every unethical trick in the book to try to win her back.At first, he showed up at Ava�s apartment to beg her to come back, but she always locked him out and ignored him every time. When that didn�t work, he tried to call her dozens of times a day. Ava never picked up once. He then had Luna (who was also a student in one of Ava�s classes) hand me and Ava these shitty hand written apology notes. We could tell that Luna really didn�t like being her father�s pawn in harassing my sister, but did it to avoid her father�s wrath. However, she did apologize profusely for her father�s behavior every time she half heatedly handed his notes to us.Within half a month, Charlie escalated from being a nuisance to a full on threat. He started to follow Ava from her work to her apartment, and every time she went shopping. Charlie would leave threatening notes in Ava�s mailbox. It eventually escalated into full on break ins into her apartment. He would break furniture, destroyed her television set, and even chopped her bed with a butcher knife. However, nothing would ever be stolen. Ava tried to change the locks and utilized other security measures to stop the incidents, but Charlie was always one step ahead of her. Understandably, Ava and the rest of our family were really put on edge. At that point, Ava decided to issue out a restraining order against Charlie. Unfortunately, that only greatly enraged him.Just when things couldn�t get any worse, Charlie started to target the rest of the family. One day after my parents and I returned from eating out at Olive Garden, we came home to find our house completely ransacked. It was as if our house endured an indoor hurricane. All the tables were turned on their sides, the silverware thrown across the kitchen, cabinet doors ripped off, pages torn out of the books, plates and bowls broken, VHS tapes and DVDs completely smashed to pieces, the couches and recliners cut up, etc. What truly made us sick to our stomachs, was seeing the messages carved into the walls and ceilings. Some particularly lovely ones that have been burnt into my memory, were �your daughter is a cunting whore� written in the living room wall, and the �faggot, you are going to die soon� left for me in my bedroom�s ceiling. Evidently, the intruder broke in by breaking our backdoor window. Just about immediately, we knew that Charlie was responsible. As anyone would do in our situation, my parents called the cops. We informed them about Charlie. The police told us they would look into it, but we never heard anything back from them.  To put very mildly, life was a living hell for my family and I in those several agonizingly long weeks. There was never a time were we didn�t have to watch our backs. Every car that drove past our house and bump in the night put us on edge. Every time the phone rang, we dreaded that is was Charlie�s voice on the other end, or terrible news that happened to Ava or some other family member.One Friday night after school, I went over to a friend�s house. Earlier that day, Luna had warned me that her father was planning on something, but she didn�t know what. Luna�s words greatly unnerved me, but I tried to push it past my mind. My friend and I played video games until nightfall. As I had to work fairly early the next morning, I needed to head home. Since my house was only 10-15 minutes away on foot, I just decided to walk home. I figured if Charlie were to show up, I could just run and hide in a neighbor's house or something. Stupid decision, I know. Keep in mind, I was just a teenager back then who still had that invincibility mentality. As I was walking down the road, I heard a van slowly driving behind me. I turned around to see who it was. My heart dropped several beats, when I saw Charlie in the driver�s seat. I tried to run, but my body couldn�t move. It was as if I was completely frozen in place. He rolled down his window, and pointed a revolver at me. Charlie then yelled something on the lines of �get into the van, or I will blow your fucking head off�. For reasons that I couldn�t understand even at the time, I just compiled. I opened the van�s side door and climbed in, while mentally preparing myself for the worst. Charlie handcuffed my wrists behind my back, and tapped my mouth shut. He then drove off and I blanked out. The next thing I remember, I was standing in front of Ava�s apartment. I felt the barrel of the gun touch the bottom of my head, and Charlie�s arm wrapped tightly around my neck. He then shouted for Ava to come out, and he would paint her door with my blood if she dared to call the police. Slowly, she emerged from her apartment. Ava was literally trembling in terror, and was so frightened that she could barely form any cohesive sentences. The only thing I could make out from her was �alright...alright, just don�t hurt him�. I wanted to tell her to just let the sick fuck kill me on the spot, so he could spent the rest of his miserable life rotting in prison. It would have been so worth it. Charlie pushed me to the ground, and walked over to Ava. He then tied her arms to her body, handcuffed her hands behind her back, and tapped her mouth shut. After he finished tying her up, Charlie picked Ava up on his shoulders. Charlie then grabbed my elbow, and forced me to stand back up. I felt the palm of his hand against my back. He pushed me to walk towards his van.In contrast to Ava, who was sobbing and making loud muffled moans, I was completely silent. I was trapped in my own thoughts, trying to comprehend what was actually happening. It�s very difficult to describe my state of mind at the moment with words on paper. However, you could loosely say that it felt like an out of body experience. Almost zombie like in a way.Charlie opened the van door for me and shoved me in. Seconds later, he tossed Ava in as well. Before climbing into the driver�s seat, he tied me and Ava together. Charlie turned the keys, and drove away. As we were driving to wherever Charlie was taking us, Ava turned her head towards me and looked directly into my eyes. She tried to mumble something to me, but the gag made her words completely unintelligible. However, I picked up the gist of the message through her tear filled eyes. Ava was trying to reassure me (and herself) that everything was going to be alright. I felt her hair rubbed against the back of my head, and she pressed her cheeks against mine.After what seemed to be an eternity, we finally reached Charlie�s driveway. He then pulled into his garage. After the garage door fully closed, Charlie forced us out of his van. Luna opened the door and greeted us with the most wide eyed look imaginable. Her younger siblings took a quick peek at us from behind her back. With a barely audible voice, she asked �dad, what are you doing?� Charlie responded only with a shove, as he herded me and Ava into the house. We were taken to a cellar in the basement. Ava and I were placed on some mattress to sleep for the night, and we were chained by the ankles to the cellar�s walls. Charlie then closed the cellar�s door, and we were trapped in pitch darkness. I felt Ava�s arms wrapped tightly around my chest, and she pulled me towards her. She then hovered her lips to my ear, and whispered �I am so sorry for introducing that bastard to your life.� I tried to reassure her that it was okay, but she cut me off with a tangent on how she failed both as a sister and as a teacher to me. With a trembling tone, Ava talked about how would she give everything she ever had to see her children again. She also talked about how she missed the rest of our family, her group of friends, and the students she taught. I nodded to every word that she spoke, as I reached for her hand to hold it. As my tunnel vision slowly adjusted to the darkness, I could make out a faint smile on her face. It seemed like my silent gesture had soothed Ava somewhat. She leaned over to me and kissed my forehead. Ava then critiqued my paper on the themes of George Orwell�s 1984 that I recently turned in to her. Classic Ava. A millisecond later, we went silent, as we retreated to our own private thoughts. Personally, I pondered about death and the afterlife. I wondered to myself, if Charlie were to kill me and Ava tomorrow, would there be some sort of afterlife like heaven in store for us, if we would be incarnated to another life, or would we simply be sent to an endless void of oblivion? Such questions made my stomach quiver, as there was a good chance that we would be finding out soon.Out of some miracle from the heavens, we finally dozed off to sleep in that cramped and cold cellar. We awoken to Charlie tugging on our shoulders. He binded our wrists before unlocking the chains. Charlie escorted us to his kitchen for breakfast. Luna had cooked up some biscuits and gravy. As soon as we entered the kitchen, Charlie pulled up two chairs for Ava and I. He bound Ava to one chair, while he had Luna tie me to the other one. My god, those damn ropes were tight. The rope burns that got on my arms, legs, and stomach made my ordeal even more miserable than it already was. We were lucky that we didn�t suffer any nerve damage from our restraints.We were then spoonfed our breakfast. After we were done eating, they then took us to their living room. When Charlie left out of earshot to answer a phone call, Luna quietly muttered �I am so sorry for all of this� to me and Ava. She told Ava and I that her dad was completely off his rocker (yeah, like I wouldn�t have been able to guess that�), and she was going to do everything in her power to help us.A few minutes later, Charlie finished his call and returned to the living room. He gave Ava the most demonic glare that a human being could possibly make. Charlie went on an explosive and nonsensical rant, on how much Ava �destroyed his heart� and �betrayed� him. Conveniently, he completely skipped over the fact that ge repeatedly cheated on and abused her in the short time they were together. Once he finished, he demanded Ava to get back with him.Ava simply replied �no, I only date men with high moral standards.� Her response really put a smile on my face. Charlie was absolutely furious, and he yelled �I am going to hurt you the same way that you hurt me.�He then knocked my chair over, and kicked my stomach three or four times. As I was groaning in pain and coughing out blood, Charlie turned to face Ava and said something like �I am going to kill your kid brother. Your children are going to be next.� Ava spat at him, and replied �targeting teenagers and little kids eh? You really are a pathetic and cowardly piece of shit.� with a hateful scorn in her eyes.Luna jumped in between me and her father, yelling �DAD, STOP HURTING MY FRIEND!!� She tried to use herself as a human shield to protect me. Charlie simply pushed her off of me, and raised his foot above my head. The last thing that I remember, was seeing Charlie�s foot above my head, and hearing Ava and Luna desperately screaming at Charlie to stop. I went out like a light when Charlie stomped on my head.Everything that happened after that is like a blur. I think I kinda remember waking up and passing out over and over again. I can vaguely recall waking up to Luna putting an ice pack on my head. The only thing that I remember with certainty, is that I had the worst headache imaginable. I eventually awoke to being outside somehow. Ava was holding me up by one arm, while Luna was holding me up by the other arm. Mostly out of it, I let out a slurred �what is going on?� to them. Luna and Ava quickly hushed me. They carried me across the block, until we reached the  house of my high school�s principal. Ava explained everything on what transpired to him, and he called the cops and the hospital. I was loaded up in an ambulance by the paramedics.I underwent treatment for head trauma, bone fractures, and internal bleeding. My parents, Ava, my other siblings, Luna, and Ava�s children stood by my side the entire time. It took me about a week or two until I was released from the hospital. I later asked Ava how me managed to escape. She informed me that once Charlie passed out from drinking too much, Luna untied us. Both of them carried me out of the house, while Charlie remained in his drunken slumber, and went to find help.The aftermath of the whole kidnapping debacle was a complete rollercoaster ride. Charlie was sentenced to several decades in prison, and he is still in jail to this very day. Luna and her younger siblings moved back to Scotland to live with some maternal relatives. Before she left, we went on a single date and we shared a kiss. That was the last time that I ever saw Luna. Even to this day, I still haven�t contacted her. Both Ava and I ended up acquiring a case of PTSD. Ava took an entire month of work off, and I couldn�t show my face in public for 3 or 4 weeks. It took me far longer to have a decent amount of sleep. Ava never felt safe living alone in her apartment, so she had our parents move me in with her. Ava�s ex husband returned and helped Ava out with a lot of her financial difficulties. He also provided her with comfort and emotional support when she needed it. However, they never got back together. Our community was very supportive of Ava and I. We were showered with free meals, get well cards, condolences, financial support, etc. My family was even approached by complete strangers, who wanted to help out. A decade and a half later, the shadow of the incident still looms over my family. However, our lives have more or less greatly improved. Ava has gotten remarried to a wonderful man and is now a highly regarded professor of a well esteemed university. She is completely happy and her life has never been more stable. I�m still single. Never really bothered dating much, since it never really worked out for me. However I have a really good job that helps pay the bills. Other then some misadventures here and there, my situation is mostly stable. However, as I mentioned in the opening paragraph of my story, I still shudder every time I look back on that experience. To this day, I even have an occasional nightmare from the incident.

When I was in middle/elementary school, I was at a Catholic School. As part of the curriculum, we had to do religious ceremonies like communion and everything, as well as mass once a month. One day in 7th grade, it was announced we were going to confession at the church. Before confession, we were told to say "Forgive me Father, for I have sinned." And then confess to the priest. The teachers stressed that it was very important that we made a good impression on the new priest taking confessions, for whatever reason. The first person to go was someone in my class named Lukas. So, Lukas goes into the confession booth with the priest and the rest of us sit quietly in the pews and wait for our turn. Then, we hear the new Priest yelling at Lukas to get out, and they both come out of the confession booth. The priest yells at our entire class to leave the church as well, all while Lukas is sporting the biggest grin on his face I have ever seen. The entire class leaves, and the teachers ask Lukas what happened. Lukas says "You know how I was supposed to say 'Forgive me Father for I have sinned?"' Lukas smiles again. "I said 'Sorry Daddy I've been a bad girl!"'Edit: to those of you doubting the story, yes it did actually happen and we did have repercussions, although the only major repercussion was a warning of suspension to Lukas for disrespecting the priest.

A few years ago, I worked with a young adult who had Schizophrenia among some other severe  diagnoses.  For confidentiality purposes, we will refer to him as �Bill.� He had a little girl who was about 6-7 years old who he would see during his hallucinations. This is an important detail for this story. Let�s just refer to the girl as �Daisy.� Keep in mind that Daisy is not real and is part of the hallucinations.I was working an overnight shift at the Men�s home that I worked for at the time. Bill was one of my closest young adult clients. He is very kind, free spirited, spunky, and all around a fun and cool person to be around. As I was doing safety checks on the men in the home, I came to Bill�s door, which was for some reason, locked. He usually had it open so I found this odd. �Bill? Are you okay?� I called through the door. No response. I knocked again and I heard Bill crying hard through the door. �Don�t come in here! Daisy will kill you if you do! Please do NOT open the door, she has a knife!� Now, it�s important to respect a clients wishes when they don�t want you in their room, but at this time, I HAD to unlock his door with the key I had. I HAD to get in there and I had to do it quickly. As I unlocked and opened the door, I walked in and realized right away that Bill�s arms were covered in blood. He had deep cuts everywhere where he had sliced his arms open. He had a huge knife to his throat...about to slit his throat. �Bill! I need you to put down the knife now,� I told him in a calm and quiet tone. I was trying my best to remain calm and not make any sudden moves or use any mean tones that would spook Bill or make him feel even more anxious. �I can�t. I�m not holding the knife. Daisy is. She cut my arms, she told me it�s time for me to die and join her because she needs me to take care of her. She said that nobody needs me on Earth as much as she needs me in death.� Keep in mind, Daisy is not real, but she is extremely real to Bill and she IS there, just as another person would be right in front of you. At this point, I was so nervous and I was really scared. At any moment, Bill could press the knife into his throat or he could turn it on me. �Bill, explain to Daisy that I need you here on earth. Your parents, your siblings, and your friends need you on earth. Your girlfriend needs you here on earth.� I listened as Bill explained this to �Daisy.� �She said you�re lying! You need to convince her to leave me alone and not kill me. She is pushing the knife harder and harder. Please, help me. I don�t want to die, she wants me to!� He said this through his tears and it broke my heart. As I fought to stay calm and hold back my tears and my breaking heart, I explained to �Daisy.� �Daisy, honey. We need Bill to stay here with us. Bill is LOVED and he is cared for deeply.� Bill pressed the knife harder to his throat, �Daisy is pissed! She says you are lying!� He screamed at me. As he pressed harder and harder, about to slit his own throat right in front of me, I yelled �DAISY! YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOW! GO AWAY, DAISY! BILL IS STAYING HERE WITH ME!�  At that point, Bill dropped the knife, got up off of the floor, and bolted up to hug me. Bawling his eyes out, he hugged me and said, �You scared Daisy away. You saved me from Daisy.� I stood there in disbelief, wondering what the fuck just happened...Very confused and very shaken up. �Come with me Bill, let�s make sure you are okay.� We walked into the hallway away from where �Daisy� hurt him. I called 911 to get Bill immediate help. He was bleeding out of his arms and still having a panic attack from what just happened. I then called my on call Coordinator and told him what happened as the paramedics, firefighters, and police officers pulled up. The Coordinator called another staff member to cover the men�s home and I rode in the ambulance with Bill. I stayed at the hospital with him where he got the help he needed for his arms and fell asleep. The doctor explained to me that Bill needed to be transported by hospital staff to an intensive behavioral health hospital in a big city about an hour and a half away. After he was taken for transport, my coworker picked me up and took me to my car. I stayed strong and was still shocked until I got into my car and started to drive. I got down the street to an empty parking lot, keep in mind it was now  around 2:00 in the morning. I parked in the parking lot and I lost it. I cried and panicked. I was so overwhelmed by what just happened that I couldn�t think straight, I couldn�t see because of the amount of tears I had, and I had a major headache. What would have happened if I didn�t get there in time? What if �Daisy� killed Bill? What if Bill listened to Daisy? So many thoughts and emotions. After a while, I was able to get myself together and drive home. I had to be strong and put on a mask to make it seem like I was okay. I didn�t want to bring work home... I just wanted to go home and be with my family. I wanted to hold my loved ones tightly and never let go. I wanted to hold my daughter. That night, I didn�t get much sleep. I still felt overwhelmed. Thankfully, I was off the next day. I got a call from my Coordinator in the early afternoon where he told me, �Bill is okay. He is back to his normal self today and hardly remembers what happened last night. You...saved Bill�s life and you prevented his suicide. You were meant to be there and you did an amazing job. Thank you.� When I got off of the phone, again, I cried. I was so grateful that Bill was okay now and he didn�t remember most of the episode he had. My daughter asked me, �Mama, what�s wrong? Don�t cry Mama, I love you so much.� I hugged her tightly and looked into her eyes, mine filled with tears, and I said, �Nothing, honey. I am just tired. Let�s go watch a movie.� She was excited and said, �okay Mama! I want to watch Ariel!� I smiled at her and agreed to her request. That was the end of that. A few weeks passed by, and Bill came back to the men�s home after receiving the intensive help he needed and a medication schedule that worked for him. Bill was doing great. He was happy and his delusions were thankfully under control. I am proud of you, Bill, for the amazing person you are. I am so thankful that you are still here with us. I hope you never have to experience that again. I am glad that you don�t remember what happened. Selfishly, I wish I didn�t remember either, but I am happy that I was able to help you get through that difficult moment. P.S. For those who are probably wondering where Bill got the knife from, turns out that somebody outside of the program gave it to him. This is an independent living program where clients can come and go as they please. There is no curfew because they are young adults and it�s our job to teach them how to live in their community independently as an adult.

When I was in school, there was this girl in my class, she was popular and had a lot of friends, but I felt sorry for her because she was a pathological liar and had a lot of hygiene issues. She would come into class, and it sounds horrible but you could smell her before you saw her. The smell of days old sweat, that she�d try to mask with vanilla body spray, which in turn made it worse. She�d often brag about losing her virginity at eleven to a much older boy, how she�d get drunk with her mother and start fights, and often lied about how she�d lived in all these different countries, how her family were nearly millionaires. Some of her lies were just plain stupid, like how she told people her mother was German, but when she appeared in her parent�s night she clearly was not, also how she�d been to a nearby school and a gang of girls cut off all her hair, even though weeks later when I asked her about it she said she never went there. Her stories changed frequently, her mother was pregnant, then she wasn�t, her brother was in jail, then he was a lawyer. The issues she had were sad to witness, she was obviously smart and great at art, but she was a self destructive time bomb. That was bad enough, but I remember one day in gym class, I caught her putting her hair into a ponytail, as she collected the hair in her hands to tie it, I spotted lots of little white specks. I thought, maybe bad dandruff? And never thought anything of it, until I was in music class with her a few days later. It was then I spotted her hair moving, a fat brown nit scurried across her scalp, then more. I�d watch her scratch and scratch, and I wondered if anyone else spotted it too. Day by day, I watched them get bigger and bigger, the bloodsuckers using her head as a live bug nest, eating, defecating and breeding all in her own hair. I didn�t realise quite how bad it was until she sat beside me one day, I was careful to keep my distance as I know how fast the little buggers spread. They were literally falling out of her hair onto her shoulders, every strand of her hair was dotted with white eggs. By this point I felt real sorry for her, she came from a bad family and was always in trouble of some sort, she�d never been taught how to practise personal hygiene. The strange thing to me was she got her hair dyed twice while having them, and I don�t understand how she couldn�t have noticed them. You could literally see them from a few feet away. I started to become paranoid about my own hair, getting my mum to check my hair obsessively, in case I�d caught them. After a good seven months, when the things had reached their peak size on her head, like fat raisins, I finally noticed they�d gone. Sooner or later she must have found them and got treated. It still puzzles me to this day how you could go so long with these huge parasites on top of you, the itching, the sensation of movement in your hair, I once had them myself as a small child due to sharing a hairbrush with a friend, and it only took a few days for my parents to notice and get rid of them. But several months, I couldn�t imagine. My heart goes out to children like her, who don�t have any sort of proper parental care, she was allowed to do whatever she wanted, stay out of the house all night if desired, her family didn�t care about her, and the worst part was, she thought it was a good thing.

When I was two months old, I had a hernia growing in my groin area, but my parents didn't know what it was at the time, so my parents took me to my pediatrician to get it checked out. The pediatrician referred us to a surgeon that could figure out if it was a hernia or not. When the surgeon started the checkup, I started crying and screaming my lungs out, and the surgeon asked my parents if they had a pacifier on them, and they didn't. He then pulled down my diaper to find out where the hernia was, when I started peeing on him. I made a diagonal line from his shoulder to his hip with my pee. He was shocked and frustrated, when I started peeing again. I made another diagonal line and he now had an X on his shirt made of pee. We eventually got the hernia out and I'm still alive, so the procedure went well.

So the other day I was watching this documentary on Netflix. Just as it's finishing I message my mum recommending it to her as I felt it was something she would like. She replied saying she has 4 minutes left on the show. I look down and see I have 3 minutes and 58 seconds remaining. She lives 3500km away from me and we didn't speak before hand. We had both decided to watch the exact same documentary within 5 seconds of each other! I'm still spinning out about this. 



******************************



So this happened when I was around 9 or 10 years old. I was in my friends house and we had just eaten a lot of food. I felt so full, the urge to poop overtook me so I told my friend I would be right back. I dashed to his small bathroom, they had just one main bathroom so I knew I needed to be quick, I had an unnatural anxiety of using toilets around people. The stage was set I smacked my butt down in a rushed panic and started to s**t my brains out it went on for 10 minutes of pure poop stream. I finished up exhausted with a feeling of weightlessness. I went to wipe only to find out that there was only one sheet of toilet paper on the roll, I looked around sweating at this point, I checked everywhere but there was nothing except for empty toilet rolls. I was in survival mode, I used the one sheet but to no avail it was a really messy poop. I searched my mind for any kind of idea to save this situation but as a kid I didn�t understand plumbing. I reached down picking up the empty toilet rolls and used the cardboard roll to scoop the poop from my butt. I used 5/6 of the rolls and realised it was useless, at least most of the big chunks of poop were gone. That�s when I hear my friends mother say �Anon is everything okay in there� a bead of sweat started to run down my brow, �I�m fine, nearly done� I felt like the world was ending. I stood up my butt still covered in crap, pulled my pants up and flushed the toilet only to hear the water stop very quick and begin to fill the bowl. The cardboard rolls were floating around dancing in between my poop chunks, I almost cried I was so sweaty by this point that my shirt was a mix of dark wet stains. I tried flushing again the water overflowed my shit water was now on the floor and I couldn�t flush again or they would notice. I opened the door slowly, peeking through the widening crack so I could plan my escape. I tip toed through the corridor it seemed a lot longer than before my poop covered butt felt disgusting as my cheeks stuck together then slowly pulled apart with each step. I reached the stairs each step was an eternity the small creaks must have been audible to his family, I reached the bottom just as my friend poked his head around the corner. I began rushing for his front door I didn�t even look at him as I said �I have to go my mam wants me back home� He seemed confused �okay� I imagine his first thought being (How did he know his mother wanted him home without a phone) I didn�t care it was now or never I opened the door and ran for my life reaching my home in a matter of minutes. I ran up the stairs of my home and took a shower. It felt good to be clean after so much sweat and poop had been drying on my body. The next day at school he told me that his parents had to get a plumber to fix his toilet and that his plumbing system was completely ruined. I never told my friend it was me and neither him or his family ever said anything about what happened. I think they knew though and I felt embarrassed with that thought that they probably talked about me doing that behind my back lol

There�s a woman who hates me so much, she spits on the ground every time she says my name.To be fair, I earned it�.kinda.A lifetime ago, I took a class in Printing and Graphic Arts at a local Tech Center. It was my Junior year, and I was a raging ball of highschool hormones. It was that part of every young man�s life where they transition from trying to screw everything that moves into the thought of �why limit myself?�. She was well out of my league. She was exceptionally beautiful; the problem was she knew it. She existed in a social bubble of her own. A little clique of five radiantly attractive girls that did everything together. These are the girls that date the guys with more muscles than brains and quietly wear the penis in the relationship. They don�t just have beauty, they have control. The desire of every guy, and the envy of every girl. The female teenage dating mafia. I�.was not in that world. I was an outcast weirdo in my hometown. A dorky, redneck kid from the farm country in southwest Michigan. I was solidly on top of the Nerd clique in my school, guaranteeing that nobody from her social caste would ever even talk to me in my hometown. I was fine with this. I knew my place and carved out my own little existence there as the class clown.But this was a new school. This was Tech Center, and students there came from a dozen schools spread all over the county. I came from a tiny school, and only one other person from my entire school went to Tech Center. She didn�t know me, my past, my social standing, or the fact that I was an absolute spaz. I had a clean slate.I had the rare and wonderful opportunity to reach above my station in life, combined with a complete lack of anything to lose.So, I took a shot, because why the hell not?Flirting is a delicate dance that requires a deep understanding of subtle nuance. It requires the reading and interpretation of thousands of slight social cues and microexpressions. You have to apply a small stimulus, wait for the tiniest of responses, be socially and emotionally aware enough to detect when that happens, gauge the results, and input the next stimulus. This feedback loop repeats thousands of times (often several times a minute) for anywhere from hours to months. In the unlikely event that you successfully navigate the feminine psyche algorithm, you get laid.That is an engineer's perspective of dating, all in a single paragraph.Now, sitting here with 44 years on my back. I have a soul that�s been shredded, stomped, scorched, and scarred by a dozen women that were as full of energy as Lithium, and just as likely to burn your house down as a bad laptop battery. Age gives the luxury of hindsight. But we�re talking about teenage me. I spent as much time as possible actively avoiding social interaction, yet desperately trying to get laid. My idea of a successful relationship was one that lasted long enough to have to shave twice, and I was ok with that.There were only two classes a day at Tech Center and everyone either drove there or was bussed there from their local school. Half of the kids came for the morning, the rest came for the afternoon, spending the other half of the day at their regular highschool. We were on the 2nd shift, and since my school was just across the street I got there a bit before everyone else. There is a little store across the street. So one day I bought her the finest bouquet of convenience-store flowers and left it on her desk. No note, no secret admirer mojo. I didn�t have the skills to write one. I just left them on her desk and made sure the teacher and their two assistants saw me do it.And absolutely nothing happened.For a week.Because I�m an idiot. I thought the teacher would tell her, they didn�t. They�re smart enough to stay well clear of the drama of pubescent youth.So I spent a whole 30 seconds and formed a plan. I mustered all of the social acumen and subtlety that I could. The moment that class let out I hauled ass to the back parking lot, and sat on the roof of her car smoking a cigarette.Certainly this was an excellent idea. She would come out, see me sitting there in my awesome jean jacket, smoking a Camel and being the ultimate high school badass. I was the pinnacle of Cool. At least, I was as long as she didn�t notice the giant Tigger that covered the back of my jacket, because my mom thought it was cute and was actively working to ensure I died a virgin.She came out of nowhere, screaming, on a dead run, and threw a golf ball sized rock at my head. The only two things that saved my ass were that she can�t throw worth a damn, and I am a hell of a comedian when I�m scared.�Get the fuck off my car!� she screamed, clearly not enraptured by my ultimate coolness.�You throw like a girl!� I replied, which is not something you should ever say to an armed girl within rock-throwing range. She flung another one.The good news is, she actually did throw like a girl and missed me by a mile, despite the fact that she was only ten feet away. The bad news is, she didn�t miss the rear-driver�s side window. It made a �POOFFFFFFF� sound and shattered into thousands of tiny granules all over the back seat. She was�...upset.And somehow, despite the fact that I never even touched a rock, she made it very clear that this was entirely my fault. Now, I�m an engineer. I don�t know anything about women. But I do know how to fix things. Once she stopped yelling, we went back inside and talked to the auto-shop teacher. Tech Center gets out for the day at just after 2pm but he usually stayed after school a couple hours and let guys tinker on their cars. Sometimes he even came in on Saturday mornings to do it. He graciously gave me permission to use a bay and any tools I needed to fix the window. He told us where to run into town and get an inexpensive replacement at a local junkyard, and when we got back about 45 minutes later, he even helped me figure out how to get the interior door panel off (which was easy) and back on (which was not).She and I spent a couple hours together while I fixed her window. It took me less than an hour to get her from being thoroughly pissed off at me, to laughing at my antics. She seemed genuinely amazed that I could actually take something complicated apart and put it all back together. Despite what they say about nerds, smart is sexy. Nerds just have terrible social skills because our priorities are different. If a nerdy guy wants to fix your things for free, it�s very likely because we think you�re attractive. Technical repair is a primary mating display for a Nerd.In the end, the only thing that was different was that I never got the little lip at the bottom of the window quite right. But aside from her and I, nobody would ever notice that.We dated for four months, a lifetime in highschool terms.Over the course of our deep and meaningful relationship I learned many valuable life lessons. The first was that it�s a lot easier to date the exceptionally hot girls than most people think it is. Because the perception is that they�re so unattainable, nobody bothers to try. It turns out, it�s lonely at the top. This was true for her and her entire pack.The next lesson I learned was that while it�s awesome to date someone who�s radiantly attractive, it�s hell when they know it. She wasn�t the hottest woman in school, but she was in the top ten, and she was well aware of her beauty and the value it had. She treated it like a commodity. She wasn�t the Queen, she was a Princess, and she acted like the entire world should treat her as such. For as pretty as she was, she was mean. She had a casual cruelty that was the basis of her entire personality, and she didn�t even try to hide it.And so did her entire little clique of princess girls. I watched them devour, trade, manipulate, and shatter a dozen different guys. When they decided upon a guy that they wanted, they worked together as a team and hit him with a tidal wave of attention. It was mesmerizing, and incredible to watch from the inside. They would be passing messages (and this was before everyone had cell phones), controlling situations, always working three steps ahead of the poor bastard. They always got what they wanted, rides, dates, gifts, anything. They were an estrogen army of great outfits and perky tits, and could completely control the mind and wallet of any young man they chose.I saw it. I saw and understood the fate that awaited me, and I didn�t care. She was radiant, the sex was spectacular, and while I knew she would destroy me at any random moment she decided, I was determined to enjoy it while it lasted. There is a profound motivation that comes from knowing that every time you�re with someone could easily be the last, and that made me into one hell of an impassioned lover.Now the number one problem most men have in the whole world is the airspace between their nose and chin. We have a powerful, and frightfully common ability to be able to speak nonstop for hours on end, and not once need to have a conscious thought. Thankfully we have a backup microbrain located just ahead of and slightly above the testicles and not only is it fully capable of doing all the thinking, for many of us it gets us entirely through highschool and most of college. True to form, my own mouth was my undoing. We were having a deeply intimate post-coital cuddle, sharing our vulnerabilities and speaking from the heart and she asked me what I really thought of her as a person. Being the complete moron that I am, with all honesty and sincerity, I told her.That�..was a bad choice of actions. Our intimate relationship ended as it began, me with a sheepish smile, and her screaming at full throttle. She wasn�t just mean, she was fierce. Her rage came on instantly and without reservation or hesitation. I was dressed, out the door, and halfway home before I even realised what the hell happened.As bright as the warm spotlight of her attention is when it shines upon your face, the hawkish, brumal wrath of her scorn and abandonment goes to the bone. I spent the entire weekend in tears, hiding in my room or walking alone in the woods.Monday was back to normal. I went to class and life went on just as it always had. A week passed and I was still alive and fine. I tinkered with the most important woman in my life, Solna, and focused on the real problems that needed solving, like how to fix the damn vacuum leak  and how I was going to get laid sometime soon.What I had not counted upon, was the persistence and depth of a woman�s wrath. I was upset for a weekend and went on with my life, as you do. That bitch held a grudge, and she was going to make sure I felt it in her own time.She decided the best way to get back at me for my crime of bringing truth to power, would be to have her and her acolytes seduce and devour my closest friends and kill me with jealousy. She started with my class-partner and it was obvious what she was doing. He filled me in and told me he had enjoyed one hell of a weekend and then I gave him my side of things. Together we talked while printing a run of posters for some school play, and pieced together the whole story.I was, am, and always shall be, a Nerd. The thing about nerds is, we have nerd friends. We also enjoy a high degree of social invisibility, especially back then in a 90�s highschool. We�re as invisible as an inner-city homeless person. Everyone knows we�re there, but people just pass us by in the halls. We simply don�t register in their world.She really didn�t have any idea just who the hell my friends actually were. I didn�t have any close friends at Tech Center. I barely had any friends back at my actual highschool. I spent the majority of my time with a massive, 60�s vintage Solna offset printing press that was the size of a minivan. A cantankerous beast of iron and glistening stainless that wheezed, snorted, and dripped water, ink, and grease. It made a glorious racket as it ate a pallet of paper at a time and would easily cover you in ink or rip your arm off the moment you had a lapse of attention or respect. What I did have was a classroom of printing weirdos. This was not the class for the cool kids. This was a loud room filled with people who were very okay spending everyday with permanent ink under their nails. Between the noise of Offset, Flexo, Screen, Letterpress, and Xerography the room was a delight of scents and sounds. We didn�t have intimate conversations, we yelled at each other above the din. We didn�t develop deep social interactions, we hid in the darkroom when we needed a moment of peace.Printing was a collection of slackers, stoners, and weirdos. And at the bottom of the roster, the kid who got picked last for everything, was Pigpen. He was a dopey, quiet, kind, and incredibly polite kid who grew up on a turkey farm where they also happened to keep a few dozen pigs. He smelled like the inside of hell's dumpster. He would occasionally help me clean Solna because he could lift the big steel rollers that would crush my scrawny little ass if I ever tried. He lived a few towns away from me, but we were friends enough. He was a farm kid like me, and had the physique of someone who was comfortable spending all day baling hay. Big and doofy, he was genuinely a nice guy. But the stench of his homelife was baked in his skin, and he walked with the hunched-over shoulders of someone who had a lifetime of having to pay for sex ahead of him.If he had any social skills he�d probably have been a jock. But he was completely inept. He never talked to a girl much less kissed one. I decided I would change his life.So over the next couple days Pigpen and I went through a few hundred rags and a can of Varn V-120 solvent together, cleaning the giant press (blue ink is a particular bitch) and talking. I told him about what had happened and what she was doing now, and asked if he wanted to have a fun adventure and possibly lose his virginity in the process.It wasn�t a difficult decision for him, at all. What the microbrain lacks in critical thinking, it compensates with in reaction time.The first thing I had to do was clean him up. When you live on a farm like that, the smell permeates everything you own. His truck, his clothes, even his skin smelled like turkey shit. You become noseblind to it pretty quickly, but those around you don�t. He knew he had a problem, he wasn�t stupid. But he had no idea how bad it actually was, and didn�t have the means or inclination to change it.We began with a tedious afternoon cleaning his truck. An old Ford that was his dad�s originally and had been a work truck on the farm for over a decade. We scrubbed every inch of it inside and out. We cleaned the seats and got it to that nice plastic interior smell of an old truck with just a faint hint of cigarette smoke. So long as he didn�t use it for work for a week or two, he�d be fine.We took three sets of jeans, socks, and shirts in a garbage bag to my sister�s house and let her in on the idea. She used magical big-sister powers to get his clothes so clean they smelled like a cheerleader�s underwear drawer. It was incredible.We went downtown to Norm�s Barber Shop and both got a decent haircut. As the bastion of hygiene that he is, we decided that Norm was the best guy to go to on how to learn to smell better. A 60 year old barber in a tiny farm town knows these things. He pulled a bar of soap out of the little glass case that was quite possibly older than both of us put together, and said to not be shy with using it, just don�t get it in your eyes. It was cheap, simple, and would remove sin or skin depending on how vigorous you were with it and smelled somewhere between Old Bay and Old Man.The rest was easy. We didn�t really have a plan. We didn�t know how it would end. The real goal was just to get my untouchable friend touched in all the right places. We figured it was only a matter of time before she saw us hanging out and hopefully tried to seduce him. We just had to get him to hold it together as long as he could.So I started riding home with him after school. It was a nice break from the 40 minute bus ride all the way from Tech Center back to the middle of nowhere. He passed by my place on his way home anyways so it was easy. Over the course of our mischievous project and rides together, we actually became good friends.It took longer than we had planned. She waited over a week before she decided to pounce on him. She tossed him on her emotional rollercoaster and he didn�t know which way was up. But damned if he didn�t enjoy the hell out of the ride. It wasn�t that I knew the next morning when he�d lost his virginity, everyone who walked by him knew. He had permagrin for a week. He knew she was using him. He knew it wasn�t love. And he didn�t give a good god damn. If he couldn't get Miss Right, he�d certainly be thrilled to experience Miss Right Now. He banged her like an old screen door and loved every moment of it.I wish I could say that she learned her lesson. I wish I could say that he turned into a Prince Charming. But sadly, life doesn�t work out like that. Pigpen�s overhaul was a temporary fix of a lifestyle that he simply couldn�t escape, and didn�t really want to. Within a couple weeks he was back to his normal, fragrant self. It only takes a couple day�s work on a turkey farm to get that well established aroma ingrained. I grew up around milk cows, and am well familiar with Dairy-Aire, but that�s got nothing on turkey shit.I have to hand it to her, she was a trooper. She hung in there through his slow regression before he came over to her place one night straight from work and the smell could have knocked a buzzard off a shitwagon. He got the same display of ferocious entitlement and rage that she gave me, but Pigpen had a much different reaction. He was completely unfazed,and just sat down on her clean, fluffy princess bed; still wearing his overalls.And that, to hear him tell it, is when she completely lost her mind. He laughed, knowing damn well what he�d just done, and the more he�d laugh the madder she got. He wasn�t intimidated by her in the slightest. He knew his position, he had nothing to fear and nothing to lose. She had no power over him at all and he just let her scream, while he laid down and gently ground turkey shit into her duvet.Eventually, he quietly got up, got in his old pickup truck, and left. I got the whole story from him the next day in class, and he was laughing so hard he had a coughing fit, turned beet red, and nearly pissed himself.Oddly enough, she stopped trying to seduce my friends after that. In the year and a half we still had at school together, I never talked to her again. Her, and her estrogen army stayed well away from my Nerd friends and I. Balance and order was restored in the universe.Pigpen and I both graduated in �93, and we�re still friends to this day. He�s married now, to a typical blonde, round, Dutch farm girl just like just about every third woman in Southwest Michigan. He�s a gunsmith and smells appreciably better these days. While women may spend a fortune on Chanel #5, they really seem to enjoy the smell of Hoppes #9 on a man. They have a couple kids, and a nice boring life that makes them all perfectly happy.She grew up and married a fucking lawyer. I don�t know anything at all about them other than their idea of having fun is playing tennis and spending summers driving places in an RV with a couple tiny dogs. Though I�m pretty sure she carries his balls in her purse. I�d wager they deserve each other.I had honestly forgotten about the whole experience until a decade after graduation when I found out that we had a mutual friend. I told them to ask her about me and see what she said. A few days later they told me that when they asked her if she knew me, she actually spat on the ground when she said my name.�That asshole? Yes, I know Chris Boden *spit*� like some angry old european stereotype.It�s good to be remembered, and the old joke �mean girls suck, nice girls swallow� now reminds me of her every time I hear it.

During elementary school towards the end of the day I went to the nurses office because I had major stomach pains the entire day and couldnt take it any more. I'm told to try using the bathroom after arriving. The mortified shocked look the nurses gave me as one looked in the toilet bowl to see why it was not flushing. I had produced 4 long dense play dough log coils which filled about 75% of the toilet. The panic their voices as they called out to any janitor nearby after realizing flushing only angered the immortal coil, furthering its transformation into its true form, a brown cement or a rotten chocolate mousse. A forbidden dessert for the schools pipes which would not make it far before clogging. Needless to say I couldnt stick around and was sent back to class as the room and adjacent office became in likeness to a quarantine zone, with ground zero being the source of watery gurgles and toxic fumes. A day or two later I overheard teachers discussing the matter with one another and pieced together through multiple accounts that in order to subdue the mud demon I had conjured through the unholyness that was my sphincter, a janitor had to scoop it from the bowl with a shovel into a bucket and with repeated use of a snake to unclog they managed to flush it away bit by bit.

So when I was in middle school, about when I was 12, I came home from school one day and went into the fridge and saw some big cookies in a baggie. My child like mind was so happy I took the whole bag and ate two in a half out of three of the cookies. They tasted funny but I just thought it was because they�ve been in the fridge for too long maybe. My step dad was a huge connect for everyone in the town, and had a lot of his shit just lying around. Anyways about an hour passes and I started to feel hot, so I took a cold shower. Then I started to feel dizzy, so I got out of the shower and put a towel over me and walked over to the mirror. I looked normal but I felt so...unusual. I started freaking out thinking I was going crazy so I called my mom into the bathroom and she was like wtf and brought in my step dad. He was like �what�s wrong?� And I responded �DHSJPZNWBWJDBD� and he was like wtf and actually started freaking out. My mom brought me my pajamas, and my step dad proceeded to ask me what did I do and I was like �nothing I just ate some cookies and went to my room� barely comprehending my words together. I was crying at this point. He finally understood what was happening and asked my mom to leave while he walked me to my room. For the next few hours I was just talking to myself and crying and laughing at the most stupidest of shit like the fucking wall. I had the worst cotton mouth ever, but my senses were fucking peaked. My step dad checked on me a little while later and realized I was still tripping and left my room again. I sobered up around the evening and crashed HARD. Woke up a few hours later dehydrated and had the hugest cravings and snuck into the kitchen and took all the snacks that I could find that was actually in its brand bag and not some plastic baggie.So yeah, that�s the story of the first time I ate edibles. And to all maybe wondering what I did with the other half of the left over cookie, I threw it away. I was honestly a bit traumatized after that, but I�m better now.

Last night I get a text from my coworker inviting me over to his place for a few drinks with him, his girlfriend, and her aunt.  So I show up and we play some pool, start playing some drinking games and before I know it I am well on my way.  While we are all having a good time drinking and playing games we've been munching on a bag of pretzels.  In my inebriation, excitement, and overall stupidity I try to say something as I'm trying to swallow a piece of pretzel.  I choke.  Not like Heimlich level choke, but I was hacking and coughing pretty hard to get this piece of pretzel out of my lungs.  In all of this diaphramic effort, a push was made in the wrong direction, and mid choke, drunk, standing there in front of everyone I shat myself.  It caught me by complete surprise, and I felt my eyes go wide and somehow I managed to cough up the pretzel. But now I'm stuck in my friends basement, buttcrack filled with shit, and too drunk to go home I had to figure out how the hell Im supposed to clean all of this up.  So I go to the bathroom and clean up the mess as good as I could with toilet paper and comeback out hoping they didnt notice.  I ended up sleeping on the floor of their basement and dipping out as soon as I woke up.

I was at a children�s cancer group�s Christmas party. Because I had cancer when I was 12 (I�m 15 tomorrow)We were doing go-karting and the first time I went trains, there was a pro. I am a complete beginner and every time he went around I got completely spooked. I crashed into the wall but was fine. Just a little fright. Easily fixed. The second time round, there were pro�s but much more considerate pros and less of us on the track. I had gotten used to the controls and was more confident. Pre-face- I am dyspraxic and so that means I am incredibly clumsy and misjudge situations ALOT. Also my helmet fogged you when I breathed through my mouth.I was speeding round, I slowed down less on the corners. I was just having a ball. All of a sudden I skidded. I did a 160 and panicked. I�m the shock I breathed through my mouth, fogging up my helmet slightly. I calm down and get back on it quite quickly. I race round with my heart pounding.A lap or two later, the second to last lap, I turn. I have no idea what happened. Maybe I turned too quick? Maybe I was too close to a wall? Maybe both? I have no idea what happens next. I remover driving. I remember the fear, but I don�t remember hitting the wall of tires. I saw black. I saw white. I heard nothing. People think I was exaggerating. I think I passed out form fear for a couple of seconds. I woke up and seriously thought I died.I woke up feeling numb. I had a ringing in my ear. I had a huge tire on my head. It was one of those huge tractor tires. It was on my head, and my hand. I think I put my hand up in the daze or black out or whatever it was.Because I was in a cold warehouse in December, it took a few seconds for the pain to set in. I felt a pain in my hand and head and chest. I then realised my feet were on the go peddle. It took 3 men to get that damn tire off of me. I was apologising profusely and realised the plastic on the go-kart was broken. They said it was fine and we�re glad I�m ok. They said people tend to crash on the corner but not like me. I thought I broke my hand. Nah, just scuffed it, bruised it and took a chunk out of it. I did cry, I�ll admit. But I got over it quick. My hand was swollen for the rest of the evening. Still hurts to move but, I�ve been through worse.I�ll do it again, hopefully with less crashes next time. It�ll take me a while- but I�ll do it again.

That reminds me of a story. Way back when I was at university working on my Doctorate in Geology. At that time, I was headed down the road of Vertebrate Paleontology, through researching the biomechanics, physiology, and metabolism of large non-avian dinosaurs; particularly the larger Cretaceous theropods. This was way before I left the hubbub of academia for the peace and quiet of the oil industry. Anyways. To earn my keep, I worked as Assistant Curator of Geology at the museum affiliated with my university. This allowed me to fund (love those ASIH grants) and build a kickass herpetological biophysiology lab that I was allowed to create in the sub-sub-basement of the museum. This was the place I spent a large portion of my time doing science.I had access to several large, extant reptiles from the local zoo. For my experiments, I chose: a North American Mexican Beaded Lizard [(Heloderma horridum)]( http://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/species?genus=Heloderma&species=horridum&search_param=%28%28genus%3D%27Heloderma%27%29%28species%3D%27horridum%27%29%29), an Argentine Black and White Tegu [(Salvator merianae)]( http://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/species?genus=Salvator&species=merianae) and an African Nile Monitor[ (Varanus niloticus)]( http://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/species?genus=Varanus&species=niloticus&search_param=%28%28genus%3D%27Varanus%27%29%28species%3D%27niloticus%27%29%29) . Down in the lab, I collected data to analyze each beastie�s ventilation and gas exchange rates, systemic blood flow, heart rates, and the locomotor cycle. Clearly, this required a lot of reptile-wrangling: fitting them with respiratory masks hooked up via plastic tubing to a pneumotachograph and 4 different gas analyzers, inserting blood-flow probes, connecting to several dual-channel blood flowmeters, and setting up for videotaping using a 32mm color infrared video system. After all that folderol, I had to get the critters to give me some good runs on a scaled-down treadmill. The Mexican Beaded Lizard was a right chapped bastard. Grumpy, bitey, and generally unpleasant in character. The Tegu was a right sprinter and would give good data, but if she ever got loose, you�d spend the rest of the day trying to track her down. The monitor (affectionately named �Goldie� due to her overall golden sheen) was a peach. For the price of a dozen chicken eggs, she�d give me the best runs and even better data. She was calm, dare I say friendly, and simply a joy with which to work. Sorry about all the background, but we like to call that �setting the scene��The critters were kept in their spacious cages in the 4th floor Paleo lab. This required me to carry them each time from their upstairs digs, down to the sub-sub basement where my labs and office were housed. The museum had 4 banks of elevators for the staff and the general public, and one large freight elevator for staff use only. Museum hours were 0900 to 1700, but being a tax-funded entity, our security guards were told to be particularly gentle in evicting patrons at the end of the day. This becomes important a bit later on.I decided to get through the necessary runs with the Beaded Lizard and Tegu first as they were more pains in the ass than research subjects. Three solid months of being bitten, scratched, and chasing these recalcitrant reptiles; I gladly returned them to the zoo from whence they came.  Then came my time with Goldie. She was more a colleague then a research subject. I knew she was a toothy, sharp-clawed predator with primal instincts, but she always showed me what I like to think was actual affection. I let her roam around the paleo lab when I was working on preparing fossils (until she got stuck up in the heating pipes�varanids love to climb). She would often perch on my shoulders as I was hunched over a stereoscope excavating a fossil and play company foreman. She would rest her head on my shoulder or over the top of my head and just watch what I was doing with what appeared real interest.   A large chunk of my grant money went into a bigger, nicer cage for her. She also earned a nonstop diet of juicy, succulent lab rats, along with a continuous supply of fresh chicken eggs and chicks from a local rancher I knew (he�d be aghast if he knew where his stock was going). Since Goldie was actually so docile around me, I was dragooned into giving lectures to local school groups on herpetological history, their general roles in the ecosystem and environmental status. It was actually rather a hoot to come strolling into one of the museum�s classrooms stuffed to the rafters with raucous 11-year olds; tricked out in my *de rigueur* Rick Sanchez-style lab coat and a 220 cm, 25 kilo smiling reptile draped over my shoulders. It would suddenly go very quiet in the room and I�d see 30 or so pairs of eyes goggling Goldie as I nonchalantly went about setting up the slide projector and getting my notes arranged at the podium. It was always a show stopper and the kids loved it. Back to science. I was running Goldie three times a week. She was so good at her job and such a true pleasure with which to work, it almost got routine. She knew when it was play time and when it was work time. I�d always give her a couple-three eggs on the morning of our experiments so she�d be properly stoked for the noontime runs. She loved eggs and she was thriving. I got such good results; I actually published a paper on the care and handling of Varanids (long since out of print) for this type of experimentation. One fateful day, we were just finishing up another great set of runs and I had Goldie in her basement digs. I�d just given her a reward of a half-dozen eggs and 2 fresh rats while I tallied the data when the intercom blares. I had a call from some magazine wanting to do an interview. There was no phone in my lab, and of course, no GSMs then, so I figured Goldie would be fine whilst I ran upstairs and took the call. I told Goldie that I�d be right back and she should just enjoy her snacks until I return. I swear, between mouthfuls of fresh rat, she smiled at me. I noticed that since this was a Friday, the museum would be closing promptly at 1700 so I hoped to avoid elevator traffic and took the freight up to the 4th floor. Also, Fridays were �clean house� day so the custodians usually started with the elevators. Some would be shut down promptly at 1700 as it was a big, multistory place that served thousands of the public daily. To say the public elevators got a bit nasty was a gross understatement.I field the call, grab a quick beer, and stroll back to the elevators. Banks 1 & 2 were already locked out as it was about 1710. No worries, I�ll just take the freight. From floor 4, past 3, when and suddenly my elevator stops at the second floor. I quickly hide my beer in my lab coat pocket, wondering why my trip was interrupted (it was a glitch of some sort). The doors open to two as what can only be described as �Karens�: with the obligatory feline-anal countenance, tall Simonized hairdos, look-at-what-I�ve-got knockoff purses, and gaudy way-too-young-for-you outfits, are standing and huffing.�Well! It�s about DAMNED time. We�ve been waiting for an elevator for a half hour. All the others don�t work.�Utter bullshit as it was only about 1715 so they were shut down only recently. Also, there were two other operational elevators on the opposite side of the atrium (some whole meters away), and there were always the stairs (perish the thought).They start to barge in, but I stop them and am forced to tell them that due to museum and insurance rules, that this was a staff-only elevator. However, there were others across the foyer or there were stairs� Karen 1 detonates: �WHAT? Are you telling me we can�t use this elevator? We�re tired and just want to go home. Shove over and let us the hell on!��Ma�am, I am sorry, but I cannot do that. I�ve already got the elevator programmed for the sub-sub basement (it was an old building and old manual style elevator, I couldn�t stop at the ground floor without first going to the basement even if I wanted) and���Listen you. I don�t fucking care what you can and can�t do. We are paying customers and we DEMAND you let us on this god-damned elevator!��Ma�am, again, I am sorry (not really) however it is, as I have already explained, a staff only elevator, and the public are not allowed���Not allowed? NOT ALLOWED!?! Just because you think you�re some sort of fucking mad scientist that you can tell us what to do?�I am a scientist and frankly, I am getting a bit pissed off over this whole absurd situation.�Ma�am, it�s out of my hands. Now please step back�� The other Karen pipes up: �You fucking listen to me, you fucking bastard. You are going to let us on and take us to our fucking floor. You�re going to do that now or I�m going to tell my husband and he�s a lawyer and he�ll tell the newspapers and he�ll get you fired and he�ll sue this crummy museum and ��A smirk creeps across my face as a little plan had just germinated and flowered.�OK, ok, ladies.� Sheesh. �Just this once if you promise not to sic your husband on us. But, like I said, I first have to go to the sub-sub basement before I can go back to the ground floor. It�ll take me a minute or two to secure my lab, but then I�ll gladly transport you briskly to your destination. Deal?�Karen 2 smirks: �Well, that�s more like it. See Karen? You just have to deal with these idiot subordinates sternly, and you�ll always get your way.�A brief loathing had just blossomed into a full blown hatred for these two.They trundle onboard; I close the elevator doors and grating, and begin our subterranean descent.It�s not the speediest of conveyances even on a good day, but today I felt the real effects of time dilatation; seconds seem like minutes, minutes like hours. Being in close quarters with these two blathering a blue streak was enough for one to wish for a Vogon poetry recital. Down, down, down; into the very bowels of the earth.Completely ignoring me, Karen 1 sharpens up her tongue: �Oh, she�s such a bitch. I�ll bet that�s not her real hair. Did you see that color? And those shoes? And that coat��Karen 2: �Oh, I know. She�s so smug just because her husband owns that contracting company. I�ll be she�s as much a lush as he is. She always seems like she�s hung-over.�I pull the beer out of my lab coat, drain it, crumple it and shove it back into my pocket; wishing I had grabbed my hip flask. Finally, we arrive and I politely ask the two to give me a couple of minutes. I explain again that I�ll be right back and take them to their floor, as I go to close the outer doors.�Well, hurry the fuck up. We haven�t got all day. [To doppelganger Karen:] Did you see that piece of shit car she drives�?�I go to my lab, shut down all the apparatus, see Goldie has finished her snack and now it�s playtime. �C�mon, Goldie-girl. Time to go.�, as I extend my arm so she can scamper up my lab coat and get comfy on my shoulders. I lock up my lab and saunter over to the elevator.  I open the doors and stroll right in. The Karens are so intent on character assassination of others in their clique, they don�t even notice Goldie. Very slowly, I secure the outer doors, pull the grating shut and ask: �Ground floor wasn�t it? Right?��Yes, yes, yes, damn it! And make it snappy [snaps fingers]!�Well, all righty then. I scan my card, program for the ground floor and off we go on our upward journey.Thirty or forty-five seconds later, I notice that the elevator has gone uncharacteristically silent. I slowly turn to look at the two Karens, plastered up against the back wall of the elevator. Their eyes as wide and white as fine china dinner plates, they were ashen-pallid, their upper lips physically wobbling as they stare into the steely eyes of a recurved-clawed and toothy prehistoric-looking predator. �Wha...wha�what�s that?� the Karens finally manage to stammer out in unison.�Oh, that's just my pet monitor lizard Goldie. C'mon, show a little backbone� I told you I had to shut down my lab�.The elevator ride lasts about 60 more seconds and apart from the shallow gasps of the two Karens, the ride was pretty much uneventful. We reach the ground floor, the gates open and Goldie and I move to the side to let the Karens pass. Staying flush with the elevator walls, they squirm and squeeze past us silently wishing they would have passed on that second schaum-torte at lunch. Just as they were to step off into safety, I chuckle: �Thanks so much. Please come again!� as Goldie lashes out her long protrousible tongue Karen-ward. �Sluuuurrrrp!�The two Karens let out a blast of screaming like a pair of wounded water buffalos and trundle their bulks to the exit as fast as their knockoff Gucci shoes would allow.Goldie got 2 extra rats and a six more eggs for her performance. I allowed myself two or nine schooners of Blatz Light Cream Ale and a half-dozen Korbels later that night at the Gasthaus.I really hated it when I finished the experiment and had to return her to the zoo. In fact, I still get misty thinking about her, her charming personality, and all the fun we had.TL; DR: I do experimental work with several large, toothy and sometimes nasty reptiles in a museum setting. I get a ration of shit from two self-important twats who think they�re above the rules. A quick trip in an ancient elevator with a large monitor lizard teaches them the importance of keeping a civil tongue.

So here�s a little background stuff, I haven�t seen my 2nd cousin since I was 6 and he was 19 back home in the old country. He ended up immigrating to New York later that year in 2002 with his Dad and sister, and My family and I immigrated to Toronto, Canada in 2006 when I was 10. So in August last year (2018) my dad said he�d like to visit our extended family in New York. This was news to me at the time because I had totally forgotten about my cousin and our extended family in New York. I was 22, and haven�t seen them in 16 years.  My dad would sometimes mention them, but I would just brush it off as some family I didn�t know every time he did (we came from a very big family btw. My great grandad had 18 kids)So I took 2 weeks off from work, and My dad and I took the long drive to New York. In all honesty I didn�t wanna go. I wanted to spend my vacation just chilling and hanging out with my friends, but I didn�t want let my dad drive to New York by himself. So after what felt like ages we get to their neighbourhood, and finally see them, my dad was so happy finally seeing family in the new world, and I saw my cousin and I finally remembered who he was. Anyway the whole days goes by as how family reunions usually go. A small party and catching up, stuff like that. By evening I was getting bored and tired of all the �omg last time I saw you, you were this tall� and the �are you still a troublemaker like when you were little?� So i decided to go look for my cousin so I can chat him up and get away from some of these people. I finally found and he I realized he�d gained a lot of weight since I last saw him, he went from like a skinny guy to obese. I chatted him up and he told me he worked as a mechanic and I told him, I just finished college and that I was working as a financial consultant from a well known firm in Canada. We continued chatting and he ended up asking me about my relationships, which Initially thought was weird but, I told him about my first girlfriend who I dated in 9th grade and my finally my fianc� who I�ve been with since 10th grade. He asked what It was like and stuff and like that and I was honest with how hard it was to maintain sometimes but you gotta deal with and push past some of the bullshit that comes with it, especially if you really care about them. A few days past and my dad and I are enjoying New York, and hopping from Island to island trying to get as much pictures and memories as we can.The weekend comes and my dad and uncle decided they wanted to go out drinking, and my cousin realizing I�d wouldn�t like the �old people� place they�d be going took me out to get some ramen and to meet his friends for some karaoke (I love karaoke btw). While we were having ramen he decided to tell me about how he�s been dealing with prostate cancer for the last few years and that he was dying. Best thing I could come up with after he told me this was  pretty much �oof that�s tough man� and he went on about how he�s not scared of dying but he wants to experience a few thing before he did, and the main one was sex. So I looked at him dumbfounded at first and then realized well, why not try to get some tonight. I asked him if he was down to get some street walkers or escorts, or if we wanted to try his luck at a club, and he said he didn�t mind as long as she was beautiful. So I pretty much told escorts are the probably the best bet, they�re usually hot, but more expensive than the usual street walker. I searched through snapchat, twitter, and google for an escort near where he lived and I ended up finding this one chick. She charged $300 an hour (which is apparently cheap according to what one guy at work told me). So I sent her msg on whatsapp and she replied pretty quickly, she was decent and $300 an hour seemed very affordable at the time especially since I was gonna pay for half cuz i felt bad letting this dying dude pay for all of it and also since He probably wasn�t gonna last more than 10 minutes in bed with her.Next step in the plan was to get my dad, uncle, and aunt to get out of the house for when this lady comes so I asked them if they could get me this one specific New York Knicks jersey downtown and that way since my aunt was with them and she�d also get carried away and start shopping for things she could gift to me and my dad before we go home. So they end up leaving, and about an hour later the lady arrives, and I introduce her to my cousin. For some reason this guys thinks escorts take debit or credit and didn�t bother to bring cash. So I had to pay her the $300 up front with my own money and then my cousin took her to his room. Once I hear his room door close, i quickly video called my fianc� to tell that just happened and so that I don�t have to hear the sounds they were making by myself. My fianc� calls me an idiot and then we both just laugh about it. My cousin ends up finishing after like 20 minutes and I see the lady come down stairs pick up her stuff, i say thank you (cuz I honestly don�t know wtf to do in that situation) and she leaves. I wait for my cousin to come down the stairs and when he finally does he�s all so happy and as he was about to tell me about what they did immediately called my fianc� and told him that she was calling me so I wouldn�t have to hear it.Any way my dad and I eventually have to go back home, and we say farewell to everyone. Later around my birthday in October, I get a facebook video call from my cousins sister and she tells me that he passed away, and that his funeral was for later in that month, and He left something for me.I ask my boss for a week off, and take a plane to New York. My dad though couldn�t make it cuz he�d used up his vacations for the year. I got to their place and he�d left me a note thanking me and said he left something for me in his will. He was cremated and then the funeral started. After the funeral my uncle took me to see some lawyer that was responsible for handling my cousins will later that day. In my cousins Will, he left me with 300 in US dollars and a picture he had of us from the old country. It was a picture of him walking me to school when I was kindergarten, it made me smiles seeing how we�ve grown and changed since then.



******************************



A while back I started going to services at a Methodist church near my house. I made friends fast, one of the people I grew close to was Eric, one of the assistant pastors for the church. Him and his wife, Karen, would regularly have me over for dinner. One day, while talking about family, I told Eric that I was ready to settle down and raise some kids. Karen overheard our conversation and told me she knew the perfect woman for me, Keshia. �You think?� said Eric. Karen told me that we were a perfect match. �She�s very pretty, like really pretty, she could be a model.� Karen says. �I thought she did model?� Eric interjects. Karen looks at him and says no. �she�s very smart, independent, strong-willed, she�s perfect for you.� Karen kept hyping her up. I agree to go on a double date with them. Karen texts Keisha and asks her if she wants to go on a double date. Keshia texts back yes and we make plans to meet next weekend.Eric and Karen suggest we go to a fancy bistro downtown. I was so excited to meet Keshia that I went out and got a new haircut, shirt, pants, shoes. The whole nine. That whole week I kept asking Eric and Karen for a picture of Keshia and they kept assuring me that it would be worth the wait. I was kind of nervous that I might be set up with someone that was very unattractive but the apprehension quickly vanished when I told myself that if she�s ugly we would still have a good time just hanging out and talking. I hadn�t been on a date in years and I knew that going out would be a step in the right direction. ��We get to the restaurant and we request a table for four. Keshia calls Karen and tells her that she�s running a little late but to sit at our table, she will be there shortly. Our waiter introduces himself, Alex, and gives us a rundown of the menu. The names are all in french or italian and there arent any prices on anything. Fortunately Alex tells us the prices for everything we ask about (he memorized the market prices for that day). He even makes suggestions based on what type of food we like. Wanting to wait for Keshia we put off ordering food and ask for water.Twenty minutes later, Keshia still hasn�t shown up. The restaurant gets an influx of patrons. Not wanting to take up space without ordering we get a couple of appetizers for the table. We also put in our drink order. Thirty minutes after that (Keshia is now a full hour late) and I�m about ready to call it a night. Karen calls Keshia and asks where she is. She tells us that Keshia is outside parking. Karen tells Eric that she�s going to meet her at the entrance and bring her to our table. The restaurant is absolutely packed. Eric and I start talking about the night. I ask him more about Keshia and he tells me that I should save my questions for her. �Karen comes back 15 minutes later without Keshia. She looks visibly annoyed and asks Eric for the car keys. Karen tells him that Keshia couldn�t find a parking spot close to the restaurant and had to park very far away. Keshia doesn�t feel comfortable walking from her car by herself. Eric sighs, hands her the keys and tells Karen to just ballet park their car when they gets back. �20 minutes later (Two hours late) Keshia and Karen finally show up. Keshia is an absolute show-stopper. She�s undeniably gorgeous, a perfect 10. Her skin tight dress hugs every curve of her voluptuous body, accentuating her perfect hourglass shape. Her flawless hair is effortlessly pinned up with two spiriling curls that tumble down to her full lips and stunning face. Eric gestures at his chin as to tell me to close my mouth. He makes the introduction and Keisha presses her body against mine in a hug. �I�m so sorry for being so late. The lady at the mall told me that it wouldn�t take long for her to finish my makeup� she says. ��I forget that she�s even late and tell her its ok. I pull her chair out for her, she thanks me. At this point everything is going well. Alex shows up and gives the table a list of suggestions. Keshia cuts him off and tells him not to tell her what she might like. It gets a little awkward but Eric relieves the tension with an explanation of how the suggestions are useful for him because of his sensitive stomach. Keshia gives Alex her drink order and he leaves us to look over the menu. At this point I already know what I want but I look at the menu out of conformity. Keshia puts her menu down and asks me why she should date me. It�s such a weird and serious question that I think she�s joking at first. I laugh and make a dumb joke about how I�m a secret billionaire/prince. She doesn�t laugh and tells me that she�s serious. I look over at Eric and Karen but they seem to be concentrating on their menus like its an instruction manual. I try to deflect the odd question with an explanation of how I don�t like to brag about myself and that we should get to know each other to see if we have a connection. Keshia doesnt like the answer. �well, I�m just letting you know that I�m not into booty calls or playing games. Been there done that and I have a little token to remember that phase of my life, my son Lequan� This comes as a total surprise to me. The entire time Eric and Karen talked about Keshia they never mentioned that she had kids. �You have a son?� I ask. �I got two sons. Darrel and Lequan, but I have fifty fifty custody of Darrel with my ex husband.� �You were married?� Another important piece of information that Eric and Karen left out. Keshia tells me that she left her husband because he was being abusive towards her, something I completely understand. I tell her how my dad used to hit my mom when he would get drunk and she left him for a while. Luckily he got sober, completely gave up drinking overnight, and managed to work things out with my mother. They�re now one of those old happy cute couples.Keisha tells me that her ex husband never touched her. She would have killed him in his sleep if he ever hit her. She tells me that he was abusive by being controlling and extremely jealous over her. The final straw was when he told her she couldn�t go to Vegas with all of her friends. She went anyways and moved in with her friend/dealer, Tron. She went through a party phase in her life and Tron got her pregnant. When Tron found out she was knocked up he secretly packed up all his stuff and moved out of their apartment. Tron took the rent and utilities money with him. �She was never able to find him cause Tron wasn�t his real name it was his nickname. Even though she never asks I tell her that I don�t have any kids and have never been married. She laughs and tells me she knows. �I don�t date dads. Karen knows that. If you were ever divorced or a dad I would have swiped left on you.� she says moving her perfectly manicured finger from right to left. The drinks finally arrive and she snaps at Alex again. �I want this milkshake after I�m done eating and it�s to go.� �how would I have known that?� Alex says in a monotone voice.�What? Ni- Boy, you better get out my face with that sh-� she stops herself, looks over at Eric and Karen and says �you lucky I�m Christian woman. I don�t want that drink right now. Put that in a styrofoam cup and keep it in the fridge. Its to go. Thank you.� She says with a frenchmans wave, shooing him away. (I fully admit that I was coward, not standing up for our waiter.) Alex walks away from that exchange with all of his dignity in tact. She starts to ask me a bunch of interview questions: where do you see yourself in five years? What is your biggest weakness? Could you name a time in which your character was tested? And then she circles back to Why do you think you I should date you? By the time we get our food (and Keisha has ordered three different entrees to go) I�m talking about how I left my old career. I have a job now, not a career, but I�m much happier for it. I don�t have all the perks I use to have but I don�t have any of the stress either. �I don�t remember if I read it, heard it, but most people restart their careers at least three times in their lives. I�m young enough that I want to get it right the second time� I tell her. Keisha is looking at her phone while I tell her the most intimate part of my life. The part that I�m most insecure about. �Mmhhmm� she says, feigning interest. �When I�m done talking and she�s done waiting her turn, she puts her phone down and tells me how lucky I am to not have kids. That if I was in her shoes I wouldn�t have the luxury of acting so juvenile. �Thats whats so hard about dating guys my age, they�re too immature-��I�m sorry you guys, I have to take a shit. The linguini is going right through me.� I interrupt Keisha and walk towards the front of the restaurant. I can see Keshia making a disgusted face and she rolls her eyes in contempt. I walk up to the hostess. �I�m having an emergency. I have to go.� I tell her. I ask her to ring me up for my food and I give her cash for what I ordered. It�s around $75 including the appetizers. I give her a $100 bill and tell her to make sure that it gets to Alex. I use what I was planning on spending on Keshia and just give it to Alex as an apology tip. I leave without saying anything to anyone. After that date I was so pissed at Karen and Eric that I stopped talking to them completely. I blocked their texts and calls. PS.A couple of days ago I bumped into Eric. (Which was the catalyst of me writing this story down) We started talking and he told me how he remembered that night. From his point of view:\-The moment Karen recommended Keshia he knew that it was a mistake. Keshia is the angriest person he has ever met.\-The reason he didn�t say anything is cause it would start drama between him and his wife.\-Keshia never pays for anything (except that night). \-The expensive restaurant was Keshia�s idea. She ask for that specific restaurant.\-She wasn�t late to the date, she was on another date with a rapper. Keshia was going to sleep with him but she was on her period so she couldn�t.\-She only came cause Karen bugged her the whole time. \-5 min after I left �to the bathroom�, �Keisha was trying to leave and charge her kids meals to my credit card. When they told her that they couldn�t do that she waited for 10 more min and then she tried to get Eric to pay for her meal. \-Karen told her that she had the wallet and that she only brought enough for her and Eric. I was suppose to pay for her dinner.\-Keshia had to pay cause the food was already made. Alex told her that he would have to call the police for a meal ticket that big. Keshia was pissed. Keshia told Karen that next time she goes on a blind date, the guy has to put down a thousand dollar deposit.\-Karen got rid of her number cause ��not going to be that THOTS pimp.�

When I was about 8, my family moved to a new house. I started attending a new school, which happened to be RIGHT behind my house. You could literally see the school through the sliding back doors in our kitchen. our fence was completely see-through. It was about 2 minutes from my front door to the schools entrance, and 1 minute if we hopped the fence haha. I have an older brother who at the time was 11. Him and I didn't get along back then and often fought. However, he was given a pretty big rule when it came to me which was that he always had to walk me to and from school. My family was the paranoid type and during this time the news covered kidnapping stories at an alarmingly high rate. That said, my brother was deemed my protector by my parents and was often burdened with the task of watching over me.I lived with my parents and grandparents. My parents went to work during the day so my grandparents would look after us. Since we lived so close to the school, my brother and I would come home for lunch. One day, my brother and I began our short walk home. My brother decided we should race (ofc - what a jerky big brother thing to do) and he literally left me in his dust. He rounded the corner to our house and I knew I had lost. I decided to just walk since I was right behind the house. As I turned the corner I saw a tall man standing several feet away from me at the corner of the intersection that my house sits on. The man was wearing a black trenchcoat, black gloves, black dress shoes, a black hat and black sunglasses. This was already odd, because it was May and I remember it being pretty hot outside. He was well over 6ft and had a very muscular build. He appeared to be bald under the hat. Right behind him was a black car, parked much too far from the curb. Several steps away from him sat the local crossing guard who monitored the intersection during lunch. As soon as I registered this man, my stomach dropped. He was staring me down. I just thought to myself, it's fine. Just walk by quickly. But as I started to walk by, the man stepped in front of me. He looked down at me. I couldn't see his eyes through his black sunglasses but I could FEEL HIS GAZE. He opened his mouth. "Hey sweetie. You lost?" He said, in a deep, bellowing voice. "No." I murmured. I was frozen. My eyes quickly scanned around him for my brother but I realized he had already gone inside. The man stepped closer, "you looking for your brother? He's gone already. I think he left you." I stared up at the man in shock. He knew my brother was supposed to be with me. My stomach sank even lower. I started to breathe heavily. The man took a step closer, this time reaching his hand towards my shoulder. "Hey hey, no need to panic. I can help you find him. I saw him go this way!" The man pointed behind me, in the direction I just came from. I took a step back and said nothing. "C'mon! I swear I saw him go this way. I'll help you look!" He began to close the distance between us once again. Suddenly, the crossing guard yelled at me, "Hey Lexi! C'mon over here! You're parents are waiting for you!" The man turned to look at the woman. Without even a second thought, I ran over to her. She held my hand and whispered, "don't worry. I'll walk you to your door." She guided me several feet away, right to my door. My grandma opened the door and began yelling at me for being late. As soon as I ran inside I told her everything. I started crying right away and my grandma went back to the front to see if she could see the man but he wasn't there. She came back to the kitchen and handed me some food. She told me not to worry and yelled at my brother for not walking me. As I sat and ate my food, I looked out our sliding doors to the backyard and through the fence and to my horror the man appeared once again. This time, he was squared off, completely facing our kitchen. He was watching me. I yelled, "grandma! That's him! That's the man!" My grandma walked over to the window and as soon as she appeared, the man turned and walked away. My grandma stared him down until he had gotten into his car and left. We never saw him again.Major thanks to the crossing guard that day. After that I always walked home with someone or got a ride to a friend's house for lunch. That was a terrifying experience and it scares me to think about what could have happened.

I work part time in a bar next to a popular park in my town. We only do Private events. i.e.: birthday parties, company get togethers, and such. So, this happend one night with a small and quiet birthday party of a 34 year old mother. There were about 40 people at the hight of the night, including children. The Kids, who couldn�t drink anything alcoholic and the parents were very insistent about them not getting too much sugar so I made them alcohol free cocktais which the kids absolutely adored and since we use natural ingridients it�s not overly sweet.One of these Kids in particular , a 9-10 year old boy who understood english and was very jumpy (native country isn�t an eng speaking country), loved the pina colada- at least I tought so since he was getting one every half hour.I noticed during one point that this guy in his late 30�s was sitting near the toilet in the corner of the dance floor holding his gut and burping like drunk peoiple burp when they are about to introduce you to their lunch, before running to the toilet. I noticed cause I believe everyone noticed. there wre some super disgusting guteral sounds coming from this guy and I tought this guy might just burst out a fucking Xenomorph.As I returned to cleaning glasses the mother of the boy came up and wanted a mojito- sure thing.As I started Plucking the mint leaves and cutting the Lime when she started asking questions about my work, so I looked at her, trying to engage in a little smalltalk before i noticed the man dragging a bunny like turd ball line behind him struting towards the door moving by stepping infront with his right leg and pulling his left leg behind him. It took me a few seconds to realize what i was seing. Mr shitsmear drilling me with with a stare that sang songs with the theme of I do not want to be fucking here right now. me: Wha... are... you alright?mother: who? \*turns around\* Phillip? Wha... first: she smelled it then: she saw what he dealtthen:THIS WOMAN TURNED INTP SATANS PERSONAL OPRAH SINGER.She screached so high i believed my very phisical being is tacken apart molekule by molekule. After catching my bearing i noticed that I was basically deaf on one ear and the other one wasn�t sounding great either which was probably a pro since the banshee was fucking dissing mister shit stream to tha ground and I would have rather not heard what she said to her husband as I later found out.Guy apparently was a recovering alcoholic and diabetic and basically sent his son to get him the non-alcoholic pina coladas which gave him violent diareha since we put cream in the cocktail and this guy was lactose-intolerant. He either didn�t notice or in his sobering mind didn�t care. I�m pretty sure i heard the screachy lady talk about divorce. Closed up early that night and took a long shower. Called in sick the day after.T.L.D.R.: Served drink to kids, had to clean dads shitsmears from hardwood dancefloor coverd in sticky liquids.



******************************



I know. I know. Your first thought is "This is a load of shit", but I assure you it's not. Some friends (Mark and Angela) and I were backpacking through a small town on one of our annual end of the semester road trips, we stopped by a town just outside of our home state of Colorado. We always had a blast on our trips because we turned off the gps, we went old school with a map of the places we wanted to stop at, and some herbal "medicines" for those extra long drives. It was in this town were we went into a bar, the name of the place slips away from me. Inside the bar we had a few shots and started talking to the locals. Admittedly we're all a little buzzed, so when it slipped that we're tourists on a drive across the country. One of the locals, a bartender named Kate. Told us about a spot, just outside of their town, in the woods, she said this spot wasn't like any other in town, she said before we left town we had to go there an experience the serenity and blissfulness of the woods. She also said that in the face of adversity, look the other way, turn the other cheek.So with nothing better to do, and just out of curiosity. We went, and I'm so glad we did. When we arrived at the place we assumed to be the spot, we set up camp. We didn't plan on camping so we didn't have tents or sleeping bags, luckily an already made firepit stood in the center of the woods. Both of my buddies went into the woods to collect firewood, the sun had set and darkness would creep up soon. While I waited on my friends to get back, I suddenly heard a rustle in one of the many bushes that circled the clearing. I thought at first, it was Mark or Angela, but it wasn't. As the figure emerged from the bush I could make out its shape, it was a man. Around 6'3 in height. He staggered towards me and shifted his feet awkwardly as he did so, which made his walk look like a funny dance.�"Shit man, sorry if this was your spot." I said, but the man didn't respond he just kept at me. Something was off about this guy, I suppose seeing a� strange man in the middle of butt-fuck nowhere would give you that feeling. I wasn't scared or anything, I'm a big guy in my own right. I stood to defend myself when the woman's words ran through my mind, so instead of being aggressive. I killed him with kindness and empathy.�"Sir, do you need some help?" He� stopped in his tracks, he made it to the fire pit and a warm smile overcomes his face. This smile made all� the tension escape mg body, I suddenly felt safe, the strangers demeaner shifted drastically. He just radiated goodness and warmth. I don't know how to explain it, the stranger took a seat on one of the logs adjacent to me.��"Turn the other cheek, sorta speak, huh Ethan?" Said the stranger, now I should've been freaked out that he knew my name, but I wasn't. I felt intoxicated in his presence, I got a better look at his face as I sat down. It� seemed like I knew him, like we've met before, but I didn't even know his name. I was perplexed, but at the same time I wasn't. My mind was moving in slow motion as it navigated me through a swarm of thoughts, and questions. He was a silver fox, as he had a head full of light gray hair and a short combed beard to match. His face looked weathered as,if it had seen a thousand days, his skin a dark complexion which looked lighter under the bright orange blaze.�"Ethan, I know what you're going to ask me." Said the stranger, I didn't feel the need to speak as he did so for me. "You want to know who I am, but you already know I'm no one to be afraid of and after you demonstrated just a little bit of humanity, help thye fellow man. I allowed you to see me for who I really am."�"Who are you." I said with a smile on my face, sitting so close to him was beginning to effects me. I was so happy, this feeling hit me as soon as he let me in, it felt heavenly.�"I have many names..""...Are you G-""Lets just say I'm the father of...many.""Are-"I can't� answer that, Ethan. You'll find out soon enough."Well, what about-"The girl in 4E will say yes, you just have to win her over creatively."�"Why-""That's important Ethan but, what's important right now is that you keep your spirit. Keep that undying need to� your fellow man. Also stay away from 5th and Maine tonight, there's going to be a racially motivated bombing."�"Wait, if you who I think you are, why are you let-" I stopped, you're not suppose to question him, once I stopped he smiled.�"Word of mouth travels fast doesn't? Bombing happens at 3:00am. Craven's Tavern. I put the rest in your hands." I heard the distant footsteps of my friends� approaching us, as they drew nearer Mark called out to me.�"E, got wood?" I looked back and the log was empty. As They sat down on the logs I words instantly sprung from my mouth."What time does Carvens Tavern close?"

When I was 17 my neighbor across the street was an old man who had been taking care of his mother for a few years until she passed away. One day he asked my grandma to come over and feed his cat while he was at the hospital and I went to help her. He basically had a hoarders house. So me and my grandma convinced him to let us help him clean the house. And it took us weeks to do the living room and kitchen. Then one day while he was at the hospital getting tests done me and her cleaned his whole bed room and changed the sheets and everything, it might seem small but he hadn�t done it in years and he cried he was so happy. Then a few weeks later I�m getting ready to take all of the bagged garage out of his garage and to the dump and while me and my friends were doing that I bought him a news paper to read. And I walked upstairs and he wasn�t in the living room or bathroom and when I walked into his bedroom he was laying on the floor passed away. One of the craziest things I�ve ever seen



******************************



This is quite possibly the craziest and most spontaneous thing that�s ever happened to me and I still can�t fully wrap my head around what the FUCK just happened.So about six months ago I was playing a game that I shall not name (small community game, also this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons), with some friends and the game requires teams of 4 to play effectively and win so we�re constantly going through rotations of a few people as they get on and off the game, eventually my friend who�s one of the �elites� of the game, so he knows a lot of the best players, brings this girl into our team and we play a few games and she�s like really good and I�m like �okay so this girl is good that�s cool, I wouldn�t mind playing with her more often�. Well not long after this my elite friend gets communication banned so in order to talk we resorted to Facebook voice chat, which meant he had to add us all on Facebook and make a group chat for us to do the group call from, so now I�m in a group chat with this girl and it turns out she�s WAYYY attractive. Easily a 9, debatably a 10. Total dream girl material. Now I was in a relationship at the time but things weren�t going well so this girl definitely had my attention.Fast forward a couple months and my elite friend went off the deep end emotionally and became a dick and had a falling out with most of us including me, this girl, and a couple others, and we all remained a squad after this without him, I end up mainly playing with her for the next few months and we become really good friends to the point where we were texting and calling each other outside of Xbox, I had just gotten out of my falling apart relationship too and this girl, while in a relationship, made it pretty clear that she was sexually bored of her relationship and we started flirting heavy.About a month ago she had admitted to liking me and expressed a sexual desire, and I had admitted the same back and then I decided I�d drive five states over to meet her and possibly have sex, except she still has the boyfriend so her options to do this (and she wanted to) was to either cheat (big bad) or discuss a threesome/open relationship with her bf.So I show up for three days and nothing happens on the first two days because she�s not willing to cheat and her bf wasn�t willing to play ball on the open relationship thing quite yet and she sprung it on him rather suddenly.Soooo on the third day I�m kinda upset and getting ready to leave and go back empty handed, although I still met up with her and hung out and we had a good time, it hadn�t been the fun time I had imagined. Then she sends me a picture of her boobs and I�m like �uhhh what are you doing?� And she�s like �my bf agreed to a threesome, come over right now�. So I go over there and literally within two minutes and next to no prior discussion, we�re having a threesome and I mean for HOURS we went at it. This girl is lowkey a FREAK in bed.I drove 1,400 miles to meet this really fucking attractive girl who�s IN a relationship and actually managed to have sex with her anyways.Still can�t believe this happened. Xbox does some crazy shit. I�m not even THAT attractive. I don�t know how this girl became interested in me. Genuinely doesn�t feel like this is real. The only reason I�m writing this post is because I really want to tell people, but not people who know me, this story because it�s fucking wild. Only a handful of people on both our ends know the story, the total count is under 10 for sure. I�m driving back right now and still can�t quite believe what happened to me. I am SHOOK.Tl;dr: befriended a 10/10 chick on Xbox, drove five states over to meet her, ended up having a threesome with her and her boyfriend.Wild.

First off to start I am in highschool, and no I am not the father.I was scrolling through Instagram on an old account and just checking up on my friends. I followed this girl like a year ago, and as I'm scrolling I see a big belly, and I took me a minute to see the problem.( I follow alot of meme pages) I thought it was little funny, so I scroll back up so I can save it. I look at the Pfp and my heart stops. For a little information this girl is 13 and in the 8th grade. I say hol tf up cause who fucked you, why didn't he wear protection, and how is your mom ok with this. I'm ok with pregnancy, but at 13.

My crazy ex tried to get me kicked out of collage and used old messages. She took the messages out of context to make me look bad but when I showed the collage the whole story they realised that my response was justified and that she was way more insane and rude to me. When I walked back into class she looked at me and gave me a grin. She then got taken out of class and her face dropped. I can�t wait to see her realise that I�m not getting kicked out and that she�s getting temporary suspended. Aha the stupid cow.Comment and like for a part 2:)

So, I was 11 years old and I had plenty of crushes when I was a little kid but this was my first serious crush. It started like fun. He was a classmate and a friend. So, we were on a school trip and he was funny as always, I realized I like him a few days after and a week after our first 2 days long school trip I decided to tell my best friends. I told just to the girls because I was afraid to tell to the boys.We were having fun and I realized he maybe feels the same. So, the summer vacation started and I didn't see him the whole summer. I missed him. When new year at school started, we got really close. We played football together, we were holding each others hand, sharing food, talking all the time. On Halloween I decided to tell him about my feelings. I was sure he will accept me. All my friends thought he will. It was the first time telling someone about my feelings and I was so excited. I couldn't wait to tell everyone I have a boyfriend (remember I was an edgy 11 years old). But reality was different.It was also the first time being rejected. I did what I had to and he didn't tell me anything. The next day (I can't say I woke up bcs I didn't sleep the whole night; I felt really stressed out and even threw up) I got up from my bed and went to school. He didn't even look at me so my best friend talked to him instead. I was sitting behind a bench in the hallway and heard him saying: "I won't talk to her bcs I love another girl. But don't you dare tell her bcs she's a slut and she doesn't have any right to know."I was furious but I still loved him so I pretended nothing happened at all, which, my friend, was one of my biggest mistakes.His friends would call me by names, slut, whore, bitch, skinny whore, ugly, list goes on. They would comment on my body, like: "How you are so skinny in your age? You don't even look like a girl. Girls have boobs but you don't. Maybe your puberty is too slow. Ask your parents to take you to the doctor." I felt depressed but I thought it wasn't depression, I thought it was love that I'm feeling. I also thought it's normal to my crush showing me pictures of the girls he likes telling me: "Look, they're done with puberty so what's wrong with you?" I thought it was all normal, my fault, I thought I deserve it. I lost my good friends just so I can be in his crew. Then, my old friends just realized something is wrong with me and helped me. I never felt so thankfull in my life. I was where I belong (again) and I didn't feel miserable. You need to recognize real friends and separate yourself from fakes. Abusing is not normal and you should stand up for yourself. And also, if you have to reject someone, don't be such a douche. No one has a right to steal your joy. It's better to make someone happy than to abuse someone. That's all sorry for my HORRIBLE ENGLISH.

Days, weeks. I don't know how much has passed. I couldn't get a word out of my mother, nor anyone else in this heck of a neighborhood. Well, what was left of it, at least. My father had left to "get some milk" what felt to be decades ago. Shortly after that, a breakout of lactose mutating into unstoppable beasts in a nearby ultra-secret site that no one knew much about had started. All the products - yogurt, cream, butter, ice cream.. It had been infected faster than how fast a man dies after falling into a river in a city.I've been sitting, quiet, in my living room. Streets have gone silent, ever since that accident. Suddenly, a loud bang echoes through the house, coming from the front door. It's them. Again. I run to the door, trying to hold it as long as needed to, until the beast tires itself and goes away. And just like that, it stops. I gasp silently after I hear slashes of a heavy weapon sliding rapidly into what seemed to be the soft insides of a rotten buttery beast. Few more slashes, grunts, and then nothing. Silence. I haven't dared to take a breath longer than a second. Then, the most gentle knock on the door. It startled me, since I was still leaning on the door, unsure how to proceed. Since I had no way of knowing who the entity behind the door was besides actually opening it, I shifted my hold slightly, allowing some light to shine through the door crack.I gasp. It's him. It's my father. He throws away the rests of a cardboard box that belonged to the previously intact mutant's body. I saw a hero. And that hero kneeled in front of me, looking me straight in the eye, both tearing up."My son. You're safe now."

I�ve always been fascinated by gore. The problem is that it can be hard to find face-to-face friends who share that fascination. People tend to be a little freaked out when they discover how interested you are in, say, researching the stages of human decomposition.Well, guess what? I�ve finally come out of the closet enough to be working in the funerary/death industry. I have been working as a body transporter for my local funeral homes and medical examiner�s office for about a month now, and I�m racking up crazy stories and wish I had more people to tell them to. My boyfriend suggested I start posting them up on Reddit, so here I am! Today I went to work and experienced something absolutely insane. So, without further ado, here it is: the tale of my first electrocuted body. TURNS OUT THAT IT�S USEFUL TO BE GOOD AT DODGEBALL. By CorpseTransporterThe entire block was cordoned off with yellow tape and cop cars, but they let us right in. �We�re here with the medical examiner.� Magic words: The cop tossed us a joke as he lifted the tape for us to drive underneath. I don�t remember what the joke was. It wasn�t anything special, and it was promptly driven out of my head by the sights that followed.We drove halfway down the block, and at first we couldn�t tell what we were looking for. It was just a bunch of cops. But then we saw it: the green-painted metal of the cherry picker. And then the body of the man still sort-of standing on its platform.We watched from across the street as the investigator took pictures of the body. The platform hovered a few feet above the sidewalk, and the man inside it was slumped forward against the metal bars. He was wearing a hoodie, and it was scorched through across the tops of his shoulders. That�s where he came into contact with the power line, a cop explained to us. The hoodie had burned away leaving crispy, blackened skin beneath it. From across the street, we could see that there was something crazy going on with his side, too. Like there�d been a miniature explosion on the right side of his rib cage.�See there, the debris on the line?� The cop gestured upward to the highest and thickest of the power lines above us. �That�s where he hit it with the back of his neck. And, down on the ground, see... that�s him.� My gaze tracked down to the sidewalk, and it took a moment for me to process what I was seeing. A river of blood, and bits scattered all over the pavement. Like little shredded bits of pulled pork. Tiny cooked pieces of the dead man. It would be impossible for us to retrieve his body without traipsing through a minefield of, well... him.Soon enough, the investigator told us that she�d gotten enough pictures of the body in situ. Now she needed us to come remove him from the cherry picker and lay him out for more photos. We approached to figure out the logistics of how we would move him.He was still smoking, even though he�d been dead for an hour and a half. The closer we got, the stronger the smell became. That odor was absolutely unreal. I�ve smelled decomp, and that�s a nasty, unique scent. But this smell of cooked human flesh? It was worse, somehow. Scorched and eerie, and it haunted my nostrils far longer than decomp ever has. This was ten hours ago, and the smell keeps wafting randomly back into my awareness from nowhere.It was slippery, trying to walk on the sidewalk where the bits of him had landed. The organic material mixed with recent rainfall to produce a slick, almost icy-feeling surface. Now that we were close to him, we could see what was going on with his right side: He was pressed up against the metal railing of the cherry picker, and where he�d been in contact with it, his flesh had been cooked away. His liver was clearly visible, open to the air, with his hoodie burned into the edges of the wound. There was a visibly crispy quality to his flesh. His arms were frozen in bent positions, both hands mutilated by the electricity. One of his hands was missing its fingers: They were charred away. The other was peeling, the epidermis stripped back like a latex glove to reveal cooked flesh. It�s crass, I know, but it�s really the only way to describe how these parts of the body appeared: cooked.One of the men there knew how to operate the machinery, so we had a brief conference with him and decided that the best way to lower the body to the ground would be to slowly tilt the platform itself so that we could get gravity to assist us in easing him onto the sidewalk. So I got in position to brace the body, in a strong stance with my hands pressed against the back of his shoulder. My partner was to the side bracing the man�s waist. The platform began slowly to tilt toward me.Nobody was expecting what happened next. As the tilting motion began, we knew the body was going to shift, of course. That was the whole point. And at first it went as we�d expected. I was holding him, and he wasn�t moving that much. He seemed to have gone sort of rigid against the side of the cherry picker.And then his head fell off. And, given my position and the workings of gravity, I was between where it had been and where it would land on the sidewalk. Time slowed down, and some honorable part of my brain insisted that I should DO SOMETHING. Protect him from this indignity somehow. By... what? Catching his head in my arms like a football?Nope. I actually think that passed my lips: �NOPE.� My basic human selfishness took over, and I dodged out of the way, slipping and sliding and probably looking absolutely absurd. I dodged that head, and heard it hit the sidewalk with a sickening THUNK. It was the sound a bowling ball would make. It was a heavy sound, both physically and emotionally. Somber as fuck. I looked around and saw my own shock mirrored on everybody else�s faces. One of the cops said, �That�s the most fucked up thing I�ve ever seen.�(Nobody bothers with the niceties on scenes like this. If you need to drop an f-bomb, you drop an f-bomb, no matter what uniform you�re wearing.)Nobody blamed me for getting out of the way.Now that I could see his face, I took a moment to look. His skin was an angry red, and it was bloated like he�d been decomposing for days. It had been cooked from the inside out. His hair was crispy and fried-looking. The charred stump of his spine extended from the base of his skull, and suddenly it seemed obvious. He�d hit the power line across the backs of his shoulders. Of course he�d been decapitated. His head had probably only stayed up there because it was supported by the cherry picker itself.I made eye contact with my partner: One of us is gonna have to pick up his head.But that was for later. We�d all come through the shock of his head falling, and now we had to get back to the task of moving his (now decapitated) body onto the sidewalk. Through some careful, delicate maneuvering, we got him parallel to the ground and then had the operator withdraw the machine from beneath him. We cradled him down to the sidewalk as gently as we could.You always do your damnedest to preserve their dignity, even � no, especially � after their head thunks onto the pavement. You owe them that, simply because you�re lucky enough to still be alive.We laid out a body bag, put in the plastic liner, and then lifted him into it. Meanwhile, the investigator had picked up his head, and now she laid it in place with his body and took more pictures. At one point, we tilted him onto his side so that she could get good shots of the gaping cavity around his scorched liver. He was still smoking, and that smell had imprinted itself forever in my memory.It was impossible to transfer the body bag onto the cot without getting those little pulled-pork-looking bits of him on our clothes. We loaded him up into the truck, then rinsed our shoes in puddles and stripped down to our undershirts. When we arrived at the office of the medical examiner, where there is usually one morgue clerk checking in the corpse, eight or so employees appeared out of the woodwork. �Is this the electrocuted guy?� They were so stoked. They geeked out about his liver and hung on our every word as we scrubbed bits of him off our gurney and told them about how his head had suddenly fallen off. I got massive cred today, that�s for damn sure.Maybe you never thought about this: who transports the bodies. Maybe you assumed the cops did it? Or ambulances or something? Nope. There are people whose whole job it is to show up, bag the corpse, and transport it where it needs to go. We are warriors, badasses, and protectors. It�s a hell of a job, and I�m slowly amassing a hell of a lot of stories to tell.

So when I was heading to college, my dad said �listen, I�m paying for your tuition but I refuse to pay for you to party and binge drink. If you want to do that you�ll need to find a job to support it.� I�m now thinking �okay, whatever...I�ll find the easiest job possible.�So once I get to school I�m walking down streets just searching for �help wanted� signs literally anywhere. I stumble across a small, family owned grocery store. I walk in and was introduced to the manager John. He was only looking for someone to stock shelves so I thought this would be the perfect/easiest job for me. He asked if I could start in a couple days so it worked out well.A few days in, my manager John, wanted to have a sale on cantaloupes so whatever. Didn�t think anything of it but remember the price: 49 cents a piece.During the day of the sale, I was minding my business stocking cereal at the time. It was Kix. While I�m doing my thing I hear �psst...psst...hey buddy hey buddy!� I really didn�t know it was meant for me until I turned around and asked �can I help you sir?� He said, �hey, is there anyWAY I can buy half of a cantaloupe?� (Keep in mind one is for sale at 49 cents in its entirety). Now I�m thinking this guy is a jerk or a cheapskate or both but since I was so new I was trying to be polite.So I say �I�m not sure sir, let me go ask my manager.� So I�m walking to the back, honestly strutting my stuff ...having absolutely no idea this guy is following me. I finally get to the back of the store and yell �HEY JOHN! SOME ASSHOLE WANTS TO BUY HALF OF A CANTALOUPE!� I wait and hear an ahem and holy shit now realize this guy was right behind me...but know what I then said?�...and this fine gentleman would like to buy the other half�

My first job after college was as a math teacher. Aside from flipping bottles and dabbing (to give you a sense of the time period), my students actually engaged in some shenanigans that my generation (which wasn't too far off from theirs) obsessed over: slap neck. You know...whenever you got one of your friends to look at a particular sign made by your hand - forefinger and thumb connect while the other three fingers protrude out - then you had a pass to slap their neck. One of my students "got me," and my instant reaction was to yell "self-serve." Boom...now my students felt comfortable playing this game with me and for an entire week I had to struggle, with my already sever immaturity, to get the class to stop trying to "get me" and focus on the lessons. Despite my attempt to regain order, I would NOT look at their hands. Hell no. They weren't going to get me again. Need help with a problem? Slide the paper over and walk away bitch...Okay. I got caught a couple of times and even let some of my student slap my neck. No issue. I'd get them all back. A test was coming up and I was reviewing the material with them via a projector. We got to the last problem and I told my students that what I'm about to show them is super important, but that I will only show the entire class if everyone is looking at the board. Students get tense during test reviews and don't want to miss out on any material. The class all collaborated and ensured that their neighbors, even the slackers, were looking at the board. "I don't know guys...I can't show you yet until I'm sure everyone is looking." "Oh come on man, look at the board, I ain't finna make B cuz of you!"   "We are all looking Mr. ****!"The room was full of energy. Eager eyes on the board.When I finally felt that all of them were looking at the board, I projected that slap neck sign on the board and yelled "no self serve." Boom...slapped all 25 necks and then threatened to write anyone up who dared to play that game in my class thereafter.

https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/dt5xhh/got_called_a_pervert/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareIf you read the past post you will understand a bit more.Long story short a girl called me pervert at the store even though I didn't look at her much and she flipped me off.On the weekend a person (ill call him the guy bc im not good with names) I knew from middle school invited me to a get together with some of them at his home which is not far, heck i even walked there. Mostly people I barely talked to but I agreed. I only saw stuff from them on social media, the usual when u don't talk alot with them. It was pretty chill, some drinks and really good food. He says his girlfriend is coming soon and with some of her friends. I wasn't saying much unless someone asked me something. I ask for the bathroom bc one of the ladies there dropped some drinks and it got me. I go in and clean myself up, almost wanting to leave bc it was getting late and I had to go visit family early the next day. I hear a familiar voice enter the home, i couldn't remember so i go out and behold!!The girl who called me pervert is the guy's girlfriend. Now he pretty much said the most nicest things about her, describing her as the most perfect human being( i mean i don't judge but i wasn't expecting it to be her)She's going around saying hi, giving hugs and all, she spots me and goes silent. The guy comes to me and introduces me to her. Im not a bad person so i say hi and do the hand shake . She looked pale and kinda uncomfortable. Making it clear before anything if u dont read my last post. I wasn't even looking at her that day, all i did was let her pass bc she almost hit me in the way in the store. Now. I didnt tell the guy anything. I go back and sit to finish my food and drink to go home. As im walking out i say bye to everyone and i hear a soft voice aproach me as i exit the fence towards fhe street. She asked me if i said anything or if i was mad. I said not really bc im not one to hold grudges for long. She kinda apologized saying she was having a bad day that day. I just say not to worry just to watch out what she says and does before doing it again. The guy comes and says if everything is fine and i say yes. Just that she wanted to know which high school i graduated from. She says bye and i walked home thinking what would of happen if i made a scene in the party.Well here's the update on that, maybe ill come across her again as theres another party coming up and im invited already. We shall see Thanks for reading :)

On the 5th of this month mom was released from jail. There was too much people in the jail apparently so they decided to let her go. Anyways I was sick the day she was released so I didn�t go to school and I was home when she came home with grandma and grandpa who drove her home.Everything was fine until 5 days later where mom would be sleeping in the middle of the living room floor for hours and hours without ever getting up. I thought it was kinda weird but dad was taking care of her so I thought everything was under control. I at one point found a confetti gun and shot her with it 3 times at her hair and face.2 days later I walked to the living room and found her lying down on the floor like how she was before but something was different. Her body was giving off a gross, stinky smell and her mouth was wide open and her bottom lip looked kinda pale and her eyes were almost closed and looked like they were squinting.In other words she was dead.After I discovered her body I took a picture of it with my phone�s camera and went up to dad in his room and told him that mom was dead. He was mad at me initially at me but then he looked upset when he was shaking her corpse frantically hoping that she would move and then I called 9-11 and then handed the phone to dad but they weren�t really helpful and then dad got super pissed and frustrated at the operator and started wailing helplessly..I eventually gave texts to Wendy, Annie, grandma and grandpa, and my aunt Georgia and I sent the picture of her corpse as proof. Wendy gave no response and Annie, my grandparents, Georgia, her husband, and my other aunt Clara came over to the house and I met them outside the house after the police and ambulance came because the police wanted to investigate the home without us inside.The sky was becoming foggy as fuck and it was getting cold outside considering all of this was happening at around midnight. Annie ran over to me crying and she hugged me for comfort when I first saw her.The cops eventually chewed us out for some questions about her and stuff like that. I revealed to the cop that she had been addicted to heroin for decades and that the cause of death was likely an overdose. It was an ironic death however, considering that when she was in jail, she wrote letters to me and in one of those letters she promised me that she would never use again. How two-faced.Anyways I eventually cried for a little bit and then the cops allowed me to go inside the house so I could grab a jacket which I did and also brought my phone and some earphones with me and listened to the song *Room of Angel* from the Silent Hill 4 soundtrack while I sat down under a tree for a little while as I cried for a bit.Later me, dad, and my relatives watched as a stretcher took mom�s body away and then we talked for a bit and then I decided to go back inside the house and go to sleep since it was now 2 in the morning.Her funeral is gonna be on the 25th and she�s gonna get cremated.&#x200B;Originally posted here:  [https://i-me-and-myself.neocities.org/goodbyemom.html](https://i-me-and-myself.neocities.org/goodbyemom.html)New sequel here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/e4neon/the\_funeral/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/e4neon/the_funeral/)

When I was in second grade, I was in a class with a kid named shane- or maybe it was zane... imma call him shane. we weren't friends, and we didn't hang out. we barely knew each other. but we shared one thing- a sadistic love of fucking with people. also, in this school we had this thing where during the period after lunch, we would go to another teacher's classroom to prepare us for transitions in middle school. me and shane sat together in this class. we didn't know who's desks we sat at, but by their binders, we could guess they were a horse-girl and a monster truck-loving boy. by the angry scribbles about each other on the bottom their desks- we could tell they hated each-other. also, you left your backpack in your 'homeroom' during this period. me and shane sat in the back of the class. we would grab the stuff inside our respective borrowed desks, and the other would put it in 'their' backpack. example: shane would hand me the boy's lunch box, and I would shove it into the girl's book bag. in return, I would grabher binder, and shane would put it in the boy's backpack. we never talked about it, or giggled in the process. we just did it for shits and giggles. we were fucked up children. the other kids tried to kill each other every time we screwed with them. we were never found out, somehow. the adults were pretty incompetent at that school, tbh. I never saw shane again after second grade.&#x200B;P.S., there was a teacher named mrs. johnston who inadvertently stopped me from trading my original charizard shiny ex mega for one of those purple glob dudes. she yelled at us. it was just me and some random kid. we didn't know each other, or what our cards were worth. apparently mine was really rare. she yelled at us for playing poker with our "pokee-mans" and she threw away an upwards of 20,000 dollars of pokemon cards. I still angrily remember it at 3:00 am sometimes.

Very awkward blind story



******************************



I am a prisoner for this foundation, company, government, country? I don't know what to call it. If you understand the things I am about to say, do not mention it under any circumstances. Do not try to find me, I don't want to be found.I have become respected enough to be allowed access to internet and a computer but any mention of this and I will be immediately terminated.Not that it will work, but the pain is unbearable.Everything you think you know about the paranormal is either a prisoner here or will be. I am one of those who started working here to pay for things. Some were on deaths row. All I was asked to do was clean prisoner 173's room with two other people.This is when I first saw what these prisoners were and the curse that I have.Prisoner 173 is a statue that moves when it is not under supervision. It snaps your neck when it gets close to you.I was tasked with cleaning the floor while my friends were tasked with staring at the statue and saying when they need to blink.Unfortunately, one of them sneezed while the other blinked and my neck was snapped immediately.I reappeared outside of prisoner 173's cell for some reason I don't know about.This is my curse. Every time I die, I appear in a place where no one is looking.A guard saw me when I was standing there in shock and pain. He asked how I got out of 173's cell and the only response I could say was "I don't know."The guard immediately took me to a scientist, or at least I think he was a scientist, and told him of what happened.I was designated as prisoner 5017 and to say I endured torture was only the first tests.I was put in the same room as prisoner 999 who is an orange slime that smelled of home, for me at least.It started walking or crawling towards me and tried to hug me, but it was more like it wrapped itself around my leg.I immediately felt better than I have in years, every single concern I had was gone.The last time I felt so good was when I was little and had been allowed to play with my brother for the first time.I forgot all about what happened with 173.When I was told to leave the cell I was reluctant to leave 999 but I told it that I would visit every once in a while and it seemed happy about it and let me leave.My next experiment was with prisoner 049 who looked like a plague doctor.He could actually speak English and I was sent to talk to it and just generally make it less lonely."Another human? Are you another disposable meat bag that has been sent to their death?""I am actually just here to talk to you." I responded "I am prisoner 5017, but please, call me Steve.""Oh, another one like me? Tell me, whats your anomaly?" He said it enthusiastically like he had been waiting to talk to someone who was not human."Well, I am immortal as a sense of that I leave a body but I reappear when I am out of eyesight.""So you are untouched by the Pestilence?" He said it with a tone of disbelief."I think so, but I am not sure.""That is very good to know about you, Steve." He said my name with a friendly voice."5017, your time to talk with 049 is over. Please leave the cell and continue to your quarters." We were both surprised about the scientist interrupting our conversation. I said goodbye to 049 and left his cell.I was allowed to rest for the day. It felt a bit boring not having anything to do. "I should ask someone for things to do." I thought to myself while i was trying to sleep.My next experiment was with prisoner 682, a gigantic lizard is what they told me but he was more than that.I was sent to talk to it and I am still afraid."Hello, 682. I am 5017. I was sent to-""Talk to me, I know what they send all of you to do. You will face death here." He said in his booming voice."Well, I cant really die. I can only make corpses.""Lets see if you are telling the truth.""Wait-" I could not finish my sentence before he bit my head off and proceeded to devour my corpse.The pain on every body part I have was truly torture. Every bit of my body was torn and shredded to pieces.I re appeared around the corner of his cell and continued my conversation with him."God, that hurts. I need to get used to death.""So, you are not lying like i thought." He said it in a mix of surprise and anger."But I do feel every bit of the pain.""You could be my new puppet." He said it like he was amused that I could feed him endlessly."I would rather not because it hurts so much every time.""When it comes to me, there is no choice." He said it while walking towards me."Oh, Fuck."I don't even want to think about it. He killed me 30 times, each more gruesome than the last.The only reason I got out was cause the scientists had had enough of it and looked down on every possible place I could appear so I appeared outside his cell."WHERE IS MY PUPPET!" It was the first thing I heard when I appeared in the hallway outside his cell. I was almost shaking.I saw a scientist going down the hallway. He knew of my existence. His name was Dr. Clef."I see you are 5017 'Steve the Immortal'. You have made 682 very angry I hear.""Yeah, I was his puppet for a while. 30 deaths. 30.""How are you feeling?" We were walking down the hallway while we were talking."It hurts so bad. I feel like i have acid all over my body. Do you know something that can help? It is phantom pain by the way.""Go to 999. He can make you feel better. There is a scientist who is almost like you.""what is his name?""Dr. Bright. He has object 963 around his neck" He said it with a bit of distaste."Huh, Do you think I could get access to walk around the area?""Only if you are not considered a threat.""I will keep that in mind."We went to 999 to get rid of my Phantom pain. He let me in. I might have made a friend, hopefully.999 was happy to see that I kept my promise. I was happy to get rid of the pain and seeing 999 again.We parted ways when I got to my stop, the cell of 079. 079 is a sentient and self learning AI who is in an old computer to make sure he doesn't make a containment breach."Hello, 5017" He said it in his cold, robotic voice"You can call me Steve. I was sent here to talk to you, as normal.""Hello, Steve. You talk to many Prisoners?""Yes, I have talked to 999, 049 and 682.""How were you found by these wardens?""I was hired to clean 173's cell with two others. One blinked, the other sneezed and my neck was snapped. Then I re appeared outside its containment door and a guard saw me and took me to a scientist. Now I am used as an interviewer.""You have experienced death?""Many times. 31 to be exact.""Do you feel pain?""Yes, just like anyone.""I have no more questions for you.""Then I will leave. See you some other time 079.""Yes, we shall see each other again."I was told to go back to my quarters and Clef got me access to the internet and now I am allowed to ask for specific food.I am currently writing this while eating some spaghetti.It is not really a horror story but who knows which other prisoners I met.The worst that can happen to me right now of which i know about is if 682 breaches containment, he will certainly come after me.I will update this when new things happen. Goodbye and remember, do not search for me. I do not want to be found. If you do try to find me, then they will know.The second part of my story:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/eutiug/i\_am\_prisoner\_5017\_i\_am\_not\_human\_at\_least\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/eutiug/i_am_prisoner_5017_i_am_not_human_at_least_not/)

So this is a story that took place a few years ago.Growing up my dad always insisted we couldn't have pets but eventually gave in and let us have one cat (Mickey) who we had for 19 years and to whom my dad was very attached. Mickey died  a number of years ago and my dad hadn't had a cat since.Then, a few years back, I had to go on a business trip for work. I was going to be gone for a week and my cat (Bunny) is quite elderly so I asked my parents to look after the cat while I was gone. My parents agreed and I went on my trip.A week later, I return and pick up my cat and go about my normal life as usual. Until about 3 days later when I get home and realize I can't find my cat. She doesn't come when called, or greet me at the door like usual. So I look around.The cat isn't in the closet, cupboards, or under the bed. The door was locked, the windows are closed and no matter how much I look for the next hour or so, I can't find my cat. So I start to panic. What if the cat crawled somewhere to die? She's old after all (17) and maybe I should look again. I look again, still can't find the cat.Not sure what to do, I call my parents. Frantic, to tell my stepmom that my cat is missing. After listening to me panic for a few minutes she sheepishly informs me that the cat is at their house. Mind you, I live 10 miles from my parents and could not fathom how the cat got there. So I ask her how the heck the cat got to their house. At which point she informs me that my dad really likes my cat. So much so in fact that he got lonely without her, went to my house and took the cat home.I couldn't even be mad. My dad and I have a good relationship. So I had her put him on the phone. My dad (in his early 70's btw) pleads if they can keep the cat overnight because he misses her. I give in. I agree the cat can stay overnight, but I'm going to come pick her up in the morning.In the morning I drove over to visit my dad and pick up the cat, and there he is, in his slippers, in his favorite armchair, petting the cat and the cat is absolutely soaking it up. My dad informs me how good my cat is, how much he really likes her, and tells me that if I ever didn't want to keep her, I could give her to him. I felt bad, but I took the cat home.My dad frequently calls me to check how the cat is and asks about her every time I visit. Luckily, a stray cat recently had kittens in his back yard and he informed me that they had decided to keep one. A week later dad decided they would keep all the kittens. They have 4 cats now, and dad named every last cat himself and frequently emails me to tell me how they are.

This happened about 4 years ago. It was around 10pm when I decided it was time for bed. Before going to sleep, I went outside to get some socks I forget I had left out to dry. The problem was I couldn't find them. Shrugged it off nonetheless. I told my house mate goodnight and went to my room. It was now 10:30pm. I propped my phone up on a pillow and started watching YouTube in the dark. I woke up in a panic around 2:30AM. I was extremely lightheaded and nauseous, so I went to the bathroom. On the bathroom counter I saw my housemates Debit and Credit Cards. Now it's getting even weirder. I went back to my room to check my phone, but I couldn't find it, the charger was still plugged in and resting on my pillow. My housemates TV was still in so I went to check if she took it up. But she was in such a deep sleep that I could hardly wake her. When she finally woke up, she also felt sick. Her phone, and bank cards were also missing, along with most of our cash. In a panic I went to check around the house and saw footprints by the window they came through (The opening was so small, that they must have had child helping them lol). The "scariest" part was that one of our knives was left where they exit (like they were carrying it around while robbing us). When I did the "Find my Phone" thing, they had left the house 10 mins before I woke up. I'm a very light sleeper, so people have said they drugged us. But I don't know of such a drug that robbers use. Then again it might explain why we were both sick for the rest of the day. P.S. The bastards also took my socks.



******************************



So this happened I believe when I was in 7th grade, I�m graduated from highschool now and in college. My friends and I all had a friend who had moved in elementary school to a town that was about 30 minutes from us. Every few weekends we would all stay the night at his house since he had the nicest house out of all of us and he also had a pool which none of us at the time had, so it was the perfect place for a bunch of middle school kids to hangout. Anyways , there�s this park a few blocks from his house and we would always go there and play cherry bomb ( if you don�t know what that is basically one person has to spin around and close their eyes while everyone else hides and they have to stay on playground equipment and the seeker just has to tag you and if they suspect you�re off the equipment they yell cherry bomb , it�s basically fish out of water but on land). And so we went to the park that day and we played a few rounds and then just hung out there and talked about video games and how my friend was doing in trap shooting. My friend had gotten a call from his mom saying that she had bought a pizza from caseys and that we should start heading home as it was getting dark out. So my friends and I ( I believe it was 6 of us ) started the journey home and as we got onto the sidewalk and started walking this black car with super tinted windows pulled up super fast to the stop sign that was in front of us and slammed onto his brakes. We were all still a few feet behind him and then he put his car into reverse. He pulled up right beside us and rolled his passenger window down and then he reached for something below his seat. As soon as we saw him do that we all ran as fast as we could and he sped off into the distance. Now my friends mom worked at a prison as a guard or something I can�t exactly remember her exact position I just remember she worked in law enforcement. When we got home she pushed us inside and locked the door and gave us all a hug. It turns out that there was a shooting right near the park where we were at. I�m not exactly sure if the shooting happened before the incident with the car or after but regardless I wonder what would�ve happened if we didn�t run that day. My friend and I still bring this up every time we go past that park it was pretty spooky



******************************



I was in I think 3rd grade, me and my siblings all skipped a day at school idk for what reason but we did sometimes. We watched tv all day and our mom was getting mad about it and literally demanded to switch off the tv right before our two favorite shows were to begin. We pleaded to let us watch at least the 1st show and she did. Fast forward to 30 mins, the show is over. We lowered the volume so she doesn't hear the end credit song but oh boi she knows. So I just lied about the show having a crossover with the next show and its just continuing. The next show starts and its a crossover episode between the two shows! We were just so shocked that my lie came out to be true. Did this ever happen to you? A lie that came out to me true?



******************************



I was born into chaos. One of my earliest memories is watching my dad throw my mom down a flight of stairs, and him proceeding to hit me because I was crying. After my mom left my dad we bounced from place to place; we were practically homeless. My mom eventually met a man who took us in, but he wasn�t perfect either. He was a recovering addict, and had bouts of anger where he�d scream at my mom, my sister, and I. Reflecting on it though, it was a nice change of pace because he never hit us in his fits of rage. We eventually moved to a bigger city, where we lived in a cramped town house. Even then, those are some of the best memories from my childhood. I spent a lot of time outside, I made friends, but then I was hit with my first case of ADD. I struggled in school but I was always interested in learning so I didn�t fall behind the curve, but I was constantly distracted and bouncing off the walls. After years went by, my family and I moved into our current house. I slowly started becoming overwhelmed with my deviance, and I found it harder and harder to find the courage to speak. That didn�t bother my parents though, because my sister started to become troubled around this time. The next few years were completely focused on my sister, and when my parents stopped paying attention to me I fell lower and lower into my introversion. I still had my friends I made in middle school, but outside them I didn�t talk to anyone. I got really close with this one person by the name of Zack Chiri, and his family more or less assimilated me into there household. When I walked into their home, I was greeted with nothing less than love. All they wanted was for me to be okay, and I really attached myself to his mom. She showed me kindness that I hadn�t felt in a long time, because my own mother was so stressed out from my sister that it was hard for me to confide in her. Some time passed, and my friends mom was diagnosed with cancer. She passed away after a long fight, and it sent me back to where I was. I spent the time being the shoulder for my friend to cry on, but after he started to heal is when I finally broke. I�ve had suicidal thoughts since I was 10, and it became too much for me to handle. I planned on killing myself by overdosing on all the pills I was prescribed for anxiety and sleep. I had them in my hands, and then I had them in my mouth. But I couldn�t swallow. My neck tightened up and I spit them out. That was the point all of the good in my life finally hit me. My family needed me, my mom especially because she was already losing her daughter emotionally. She didn�t need to lose her son. My best friend needed me because he lost his mom, and it would be selfish of me to take his best friend away from him. My life from then there on was a blur; I spent most of it stoned and fighting with myself to get off my meds. I eventually overcame those demons with a LOT of self care, and that�s led me here. Reflecting on everything, I can say my own selfishness is my greatest weakness. I�ve always tried to be there for the ones I care about, but no one was there for me so I got to a low place. But with time and patience I learned to be there for my self, and to be my own crutch. I�m the only one that can understand my plights, and I�m too stubborn to truly rely on anyone else. But I�m going to try my best to be the shoulder for people who need it, because I know that�s what a lot of people need. I value life now more than ever, and if I can save one person from suffering through what I�ve suffered... maybe I can save someone from the same chaos I was subjected to. Thank you all who actually read this, I�m still in a moderately strange place in my life, but I feel myself improving as a person ever single day. I�m not looking for sympathy, I just can�t recall a time where I�ve actually put this in to words, and I just needed to get this out. Again, thank you. I hope you�ve enjoyed this view into my life, and I hope you can take something away from it as well.

The Old Old Lady. � �allo gel, come in� I followed her down a passage into a small, but bright, room. She sank down in an armchair as though the walk to the front door had been a great effort.              She was a little woman in her late seventies. Her hair was a dark grey, long and very thin and she wore it in a bun at the nape of her neck. Her face was lined, but somehow managed to look soft and smooth. I found it hard to discover the colour of her eyes for they were so faded and misty. Her expression was kindly.             �Let me make yer a cuppa tea gel� and shuffled out into what she called the scullery, a tiny room leading off the one in which we sat. When she returned with the tea she asked me to pour, as she couldn�t keep her hand steady and slopped tea into the saucer.             While we sat and drank our tea, she talked of her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren, one or other of whom was always popping in to see her. Although one of her daughters lived in the upstairs flat of her little house, she could not manage to walk up the stairs, nor did she particularly want to. She valued her independence and was never lonely.Television was her only pastime, apart from a quick glance at the daily newspaper, through a huge magnifying glass.          �Pour yerself another cuppa tea gel� she said. She called all females �gel� and all males �boy�.            The milkman had a standing joke with her about this and always called her �old lady�. She had been born in the East End of London and except for a few holidays at the seaside, had never left it.           We discussed a recent wedding in the family and I asked her if she had been married in her life. She thought for a while and said �I dunno gel, I can�t remember�. At my look of surprise she added �well such a lot �as �appened to me since then. I had ten children but two died. I remember them all being �ungry and me with no money to buy food�.          She went on to tell me when she was first married, her husband wouldn�t let her stand at the door talking with neighbours (a common pastime then) because he was so jealous, he was convinced she would flirt with passers by. This was quite untrue, but she wasn�t allowed much freedom. He had a nasty temper and years later, when the children were grown up, always seemed to be rowing with one or other of them. She was too frightened to interfere but sat and cried, hating the quarrelling which went on.            Her children all loved her dearly - and were thankful that she was able to spend her latter years more peacefully, for her husband died when she was in her sixties. She remembered him as a man who had suffered a great deal of pain in his life and bore him no unkind thoughts.            After chatting a little longer, I told her I had to go but would come and see her again soon.            The last time I ever saw her she was recovering from a heart attack. She had had one before and was now very weak and not able to see very well. On this occasion she said �well gel, I�m ready to go now. I feel I �ave �ad long enough on this earth. I don�t want to go blind, I can�t see much now. I don�t want to be dependent on them all. They�ve all been so good to me�.            It made me sad to look at her sitting there, hopefully awaiting death. Sad that she had so little in her long life. Sad that there had been nothing wonderful to remember. Even the births of her children were accompanied by a great worry over lack of money to feed them.           I told her she would be sadly missed by everyone, when her time came.            She sat uncomplaining, she never expected any more from life than what she had received.           I kissed her before I left. �Goodbye gel� she said. �Goodbye Gran�, I replied, �God bless you�. �

ok so about a year ago my dad and uncle and his friends came to my house to watch a boxing game on the samsung smart tv in the living room, and after watching for a few hours they went to the web browser on the tv and went to some sports site and i wasnt paying attention but i think my uncle accidentally clicked an ad or something, and it sent him to a hentai game site called fap land showing a red haired fully naked anime character for every person in the room to see, he was completely silent just spamming the exit button on the remote, i was on a different couch on my phone and just pretend to not seeand so that's basically the story of how my uncle showed my family hentai.



******************************



So I go to a small-ish high school, like 600 kids. I did nerdy shit: band, theatre, speech, and I swam too. Was well known and relatively liked. Anyways, in my senior year, I would rock up to school late to first hour English 102, PEPSI in hand. Teacher starts to notice, gives me detentions for it, I still do it. This continues for a few weeks, until...&#x200B;The gas station I bought my pepsi's from was having a sale. Apparently, the (now ex)manager had ordered WAY TOO MUCH PEPSI. Like, whole pallettes worth. It was taking up so much space in his tiny store that the owner put it on sale for  $3 for a 24 PACK. I would have been a fool not to buy them. &#x200B;I rock up to school carrying 3 24 packs. Whilst avoiding looks from our school cop and hall monitor, I unloaded those babies in my locker. Pepsi time. I grabbed handfuls of these beautiful blue bois and put them in my backpack. Again, I rock up to class, late. Same ole, same ole. My friend mentions being thirsty. Pepsi Time. I grab one out of my backpack and roll it over to him. As he looks at me with confusion, I say "Drink, my child." People hear me say this. People see the pepsi. People see how much I have. I give people the pepsi. I am christened as the God of pepsi.&#x200B;This happens several times over the next two weeks, me restocking the pepsi supply at the end of each week. Eventually the teacher starts to amp up the detentions to 2 and 3 every time I'm late. Or so she said. I believe it was cause of the opening cans. One day, she just tells me to go to the assistant principals office. The children are left without their pepsi. They are sad. The assistant principal basically tells me that the cans are distracting to class and that I can't bring them in anymore. Sad emote. How will the children get their pepsi? Such a fool, they'll get their pepsi anyways.&#x200B;My place of work sells pepsi for like 1 dollar including employee discount. When I learn of this, I immediately buy about 6 of them. The next day, I leave all of my books at home. No need for them. It's Pepsi Time. I rock up to school, late again, pepsi in backpack and solo cups in my hands. The teacher smiles her biggest smile and says good morning. She obviously knows about the pepsi. Fool. I keep eye contact and bring out the two liters. Her expression turns. I open one, and the crisp sound of fresh bepis floods my ears. The other kids cheer. The teacher tries to send me back to the assistant principals office, but I simply say "It's not a can." She still calls him down and I get 3 days suspension in school for "disobeying the rules" or whatever. I don't care. My children have been given the water of life. &#x200B;Aftermath. &#x200B;I find out from some friends at lunch that they've posted pictures of my face over Pepsi-Man's body. I am now Pepsi-man in the eyes of the school. Still hand out pepsi to everyone who asks for it. I am Pepsi-Man

     Last night, my boyfriend offered to watch our son so I could spend some time at my dad's house and catch up on some sleep. Meanwhile, we are having a major ice storm outside.     My sister recently had a friend over who brought bed bugs with her. The past few weeks my dad had spent bombing the house and we really thought that they were all gone. Well last night, at 2 am I decided to get out of bed because i was having trouble sleeping. I thought i would go see if anyone else was awake. Side note there are 11 people in this house, I have alot of siblings. I walk down the hallway into the living room, and what do I freaking see, a BEDBUG. I am terrified of bugs so I immediately start to look around. And I slowly realize that they are EVERYWHERE. I mean seriously, the entire living room, where the 5 younger kids were sleeping, was infested with bed bugs. Hundreds and hundreds of them. I immediately decide to go back home, because I was not going to be sleeping with bugs. So I strip down into a tiny tank top and a tiny pair of shorts. I check my entire body, my purse, and even my car keys to make sure I wasn't bringing any bed bugs with me and I leave.        I run as fast as I can to the car, but it didn't take long to realize that everything is covered in a sheet of ice and getting home wouldn't be easy. I slip and slide my way to my boyfriend's car parked on the street and get inside. I sat in there for about 30 minutes waiting for it to heat up, because it was so cold I couldn't even scrape the ice off of the car.      Finally, I'm able to start driving. I only live about a 10 minute drive away, it couldn't be that bad right? I drove about a steady 10 mph the entire way there. But to be honest my car was basically ice skating the entire way there. Luckily, the main roads had salt on them so it wasn't too bad. But then I make it to my neighborhood and I quickly remember that both entrances to my neighborhood are steep hills. One going up and one going down. So I either risk going downhill and not being able to stop, and wrecking. Or I risk going uphill and not being able to make it up, just to slide back down. I tried to go uphill but I gave up after 5 seconds because I knew it was too dangerous. So I park my car, and I decide I will just walk.   I start thinking, and I realize that every odd is against my favor. I'm on the opposite side of the HUMONGOUS neighborhood that my house is on. I have basically no clothes on. And I'm in my boyfriends car, who doesn't keep emergency clothes and supplies in his car like I do. I can't go back to my dad's, because the rode I'm on is also a hill. And i managed to safely slide down it, but i wasn't able to drive back up. So I'm stuck where I'm at.    I call 911. I have never called 911 before. I explain my situation and the lady straight up says "what do you expect us to do for you? We can't do anything for you." I realize she's right and I decide to suck it up and just walk the 2 miles home. (yes the neighborhood is really that f***ing huge) I thought if I cut through the soccer fields nextdoor it would be faster so I decide to do that. After walking for about a half hour, I realize there is a huge fence between the neighborhood and the fields. So I start to climb, and I end up falling over it. Okay, whatever, I'm fine. I'm freezing, but at this point I really have no feeling left in my body.     Great, now I have to walk through a wooded area that's separating the neighborhood and soccer fields. It will be okay right? I live in Missouri, I'm used to walking in the woods. It's fine for the most part until I realize there's a whole ass river that I didn't even know was there. Luckily, there is a fallen tree that is sturdy enough to hold my 110lb self. So I straddle that thing. I sit on it, wrap my legs around and use my arms to pull my body forward. It takes about 5 minutes to get all the way across, but I did it. And I didn't die. I had been praying to god the whole time. So I thanked him. I finally made it to the neighborhood. I run through a few houses yards until I get to mine. I put the key in the door, twist the doorknob, push the door, and.... nothing. It's deadlocked. He deadbolted the door despite knowing neither of us have keys for it. I try every door, window, everything I could think of to get inside and nothing works. After all this walking I finally make it home and I can't even get inside. My boyfriend is really annoyingly bad at waking up. He sleeps through his alarm every morning. Luckily my phone was fully charged. So I called him for an hour and a half straight until he finally got up and let me in.    I tell him what happens and he acts like it's not big deal despite the fact that I'm practically naked, its 10 degrees Fahrenheit outside, my skin is purplish blue, and I'm covered in cuts from the thorns. I turn on the shower to clean myself up, get undressed, and that's when I realized the actual damage of my "journey." My thighs where I had sat onto the tree are completely torn up. There's more blood than skin. Everything surrounding the huge gashes in my legs are purple and blue. And the rest of my skin is bright red with black and purple spots all around it. I didn't even feel any pain. I couldn't believe my eyes. The cold had really taken a toll on my tiny body. I get into the shower, and the water just burns. I know that you aren't supposed to use hot water when you're super cold, so I started the water pretty cool. And as the water heats up, and my body thaws, I start to feel the pain of my injuries. It felt like I was being cut up right in that moment, my whole entire body all at once was feeling the pain it hadn't felt earlier. It was absolutely horrible.    Fast forward 18 hours and here I am writing this, still in an immense amount of pain. I can't walk, my legs are too cut up. Everytime I move them, the skin stretches and reopens the wounds. My voice is gone and my lungs feel heavy, it's hard to breathe. My nose feels closed off. I probably got sick from the cold. I decided to write this, because my boyfriend and my family are acting as if nothing happened. I told my boyfriend the story and he laughed. I've always felt like I've had no support in my life and now it's just confirmed. they don't care that I could have died, they think it's funny. I needed to vent about my experience. I know others have it worse, but I'm struggling to get over last night. Edited to add- I realize that I made some stupid decisions, and that this was all preventable. Problem was I didn't realize my actions would have consequences until after it already happened. I've lived in missouri my entire life and I've experienced bad roads but honestly nothing like that night. I got hurt, I lived, and I learned. I'm still young and still learning. I was thrown into adulthood when I had my son, so I honestly just make some really dumb decisions sometimes. Thanks for the support guys. And for those of you who think I'm an idiot, I agree. TLDR Left my dads in the middle of an ice storm because they had bed bugs, got stranded and had to walk home through the woods. ended up cutting up my entire body and now I can't walk because of my "injuries" Probably have pneumonia or something now

This was sometime last year, some buddy�s and I  [All males ages 22-25] were hanging out. One of them pulled a piece of string off the end of his shirt, presented it to all of us and dared me to eat it. Obviously I�m not backing out of an easy challenge, so I ate it. The next day, during my morning poop. I literally pooped out the string and it was tied together. I don�t care if you believe me, but I literally shit you knot, it really happened.

Sorry for my english. My name's Vadim, so I decided to change "A" to "I" in the english word "goddamn" and use "goddimn" as a username because of the similar sounding ("vadim" sounds like "voddimn" in Russian). I study english yet and don't know if that was a good idea, so I signed up on reddit, found this place and wrote the post. That's my little story. Update: I've just posted the similar post to another subreddit and received a bunch of downvotes (feel like a fool). If you like my username, pls upvote; or tell me why if you don't.

\*Based on a true story\*YouTube Audio Version:[https://youtu.be/7VhggTKM0tY](https://youtu.be/7VhggTKM0tY)This story takes place when I was 16 years old in my sophomore year of high school. Now I wasn't the brightest of all kids and this story will explain that one to you.My 16 year old self thought it was a perfect idea to hop onto the dark web and see what they have to offer in the "shops". Now for those who dont know what the dark web is... well... the name explains it. Its a dark place of the internet where you can literally find anything. From crazy people to geniuses. Now i don't recommend checking out the dark web at all.I hop on this website called "AlphaBay Market" and start searching just because I was curious. I come across this "Counterfeit $20 Bill" which looks 100% real and had many many many positive reviews so I ordered the bulk amount to mess around with. I ended up buying 100 $20 bills for around $30 . Not bad I thought to myself. Then I hop off the internet and wait.About 2 weeks later I get my bills in the mail and I was shocked from how real the bills looked. So a great idea popped in my head. Why don't I just make it rain at school? Hilarious idea... right? WRONG!I go into school like any other normal day, going through my classes up until lunch time. Now I eat my food fast, just a weird habit, so I ate my lunch and walked up to the 3rd story of my high school. Now from up here it looks down on everyone at lunch so literally everyone would see money falling. Which is a win in my book. Now I didn't say I was bright.I put all the bills in my hand and start making it rain like someone would at a strip club. And lemme tell you it was great seeing at least 100 different people running for the money and seeing all the chaos unfold in front of my eyes. But I dip out because I started to realize what I've just done.5th period starts and I'm like "great coast is clear, im good". I go through that period like nothing but then right before the bell rings the officer of the school pulls me out of class and takes me straight to his office and closes the door. Without saying anything else he reads me my rights. At this moment, i know im screwed.He explains that the bills look super real and a few people used it at lunch. He then tells me It was all captured on the camera (which you can barely see me when i toss the money but when i leave thats when you see me). Which is very unfortunate for me. After sitting for a few minutes the principle and officer determine that the police wont get involved but I have to attend an alternative school for 6 months before getting accepted back into my high school and that I was expelled until I completed it.So I went through and completed the rest of the year there. Let me tell you that, it was a pretty bad school. Kids were there for threatening teachers and principals, trying to stab kids, fighting, dealing drugs, etc. But I honestly enjoyed how easy it was.Moral of the story, don't be stupid like me and buy counterfeit bills. It could lead to you having a felony and prison so honestly its not even worth it.

  My mother went to "beauty school" as it was called when I was around 12 years old. To not pay a babysitter or trust us with friends, she made my little sister and I go with her every Saturday. My sister always got a wash, curl and comb-out. But for whatever demented reason she told the other students they could do anything they wanted to my hair. One week it was dyed, the next permed, then straightened, then curled, or whatever that student needed to work on. The kids at school started calling me Guinea Pig because every Monday I had some mess on my head. I'm amazed I had any hair left by the time she graduated.  If you have a perm you can't live with, immediately wash your hair. Conditioning will help as well.

My grandma is the one who told me this story, I was only 4 (during the mid 90�s)at the time so I don�t really remember it.When I was little and the weather was good my granny would take me outside and teach how to garden and just enjoy the weather with her and my grandad.  I grew up with them and my mom on my families farm in a semi rural town in the South where the grass is green year round.  My grandparents grew up and lived in the same area their whole life so they were pretty popular in town and had many friends so they always knew when something was going on in town.  The summer I turned 4 is when my grandparents friends were telling them about a man that lived on our road(about 3 or 4 miles from us)who they thought might be a pedophile as different rumors were going around.  My grandparents always listened to the gossip but they always discussed it between themselves if they should believe it or not.  This time was different as the man was my cousins boyfriend who lived with her and her children.  My grandma hadn�t heard it before this moment so thought she had better just investigate herself since this was family and if something was going on she knew that she would get them out if need be.  After that she, my mom and my grandfather made numerous attempts to contact my cousin over a couple days, who only gave them short answers and evaded any questions.  My mom finally decided to go to the house with my uncle, according to my grandma my cousin only opened the door halfway spoke quietly and then shut the door.My family decided to go to the police, my grandpa called and told them that he wasn�t for sure what was going on but he knew something was wrong and informed them of the suspicions that he had heard.  They went and investigated but my family hadn�t heard anything after that.  My grandma sits on her porch everyday in the summer and while these suspicions were happening she noticed a truck that always slowly drove past our house a few times during the day, she asked my grandpa about it too but he didn�t know who it belonged too.  This kind of bothered her but she thought she was just being nosey.A couple weeks passed, my grandma saw the truck less and decided to dismiss it fully.  We were in the yard doing our regular routine of gardening and my grandpa was cutting grass.  My mom got home from work and told my grandma about a weird call she got at work, the call sounded like a woman crying and then it just disconnected.  At that point my grandma decided to go inside and try to reach my cousin one more time, she waved my grandpa down to stop him and my mom instructed me to stay in the garden in front of the house and don�t go anywhere before they all went inside.This time my mom calls with my grandparents nearby, my mom gets in touch with her and they talk for a bit with everything seeming normal, and then my mom gets a horrified look on her face and tells my cousin to calm down.  At this point my grandpa runs to the back of the house yelling �GRAB OP NOW� My mom tried to yell back at him and my grandma went and looked outside horrified and yelled at my mom to get me while they were both running outside through the side door.  My grandma saw the truck parked in the front yard, backed in and facing the road. And when she ran outside with my mom saw the man standing in front of me trying to wipe his face saying �Stop Goddamnnit.� With me standing against the house crying and I had started yelling �Go away!!� and throwing dirt at the man. My grandma said my grandpa came running from the front door holding a shot gun at the man yelling something like �N**** YOU GONE BACK UP NOW!!� My mom then grabbed me and ran back into the house. My grandma looked at the man and asked him who he was and where he came from, she noticed that he was blinking nonstop and kept trying to wipe his face and that he had dirt all over his face and shirt. My neighbors also noticed the commotion and had already started coming to our house.  The man then bolted for his truck, my grandpa shot towards the truck and then put the gun back on the man.  My grandma then said something like�Muthafucka you better tell me the hell you�re doing on our land and why you trying to talk to my grand baby.�The man didn�t answer so my grandad yelled at him to answer her.  The man then started stuttering telling them he didn�t put a hand on me he just wanted to make sure I wasnt doing anything dangerous because I was so little and the lawnmower was nearby.  My grandparents knew he was lying.  The neighbors then came running into the yard asking me grandparents who was this was.  My mom came running out with a rifle saying that I was ok and that I said no when she asked me if he had touched me. And apparently one of the neighbors became enraged and yelled something like �I knew I knew your ugly face!!! You that pedophile from over yonder nasty SOB! I seen you at the store walking around with them girls and now your here tryna mess with 4 year olds??�  At this point a screaming match ensued with everyone and the man starts crying, my mom then stepped forward and swung the back of the rifle into his head knocking him to the ground. My mom then pointed it to his head and my grandma pulled her back yelling at her to call the cops.  My grandma then realized that this was my cousins boyfriend, the cops arrived a few mins later and my grandparents, mom, me and the neighbors gave their statements but the only thing they could get him with was trespassing, since I denied that he had touched me.  My grandpa called them every name in the book and told them they could forget hunting rights on his land from them on.  My grandparents pressed charges and the man left, I couldn�t be outside by myself after that and my grandpa had started keeping a rifle with him at all times.  My grandma then made it her mission to get my cousins out, but no matter how hard she tried my older cousin just denied everything.The man ended up leaving town a few months later we have no clue where he went.My cousins who were a little older than me were depressed for a long time but they are happier people now with good lives. They told us that they were told the man died in jail years later when they finally decided to press charges and inform people about everything that he had done.The older cousin passed away a few years after the incident from heart issues that I still think were from all the stress the man put her through and we still don�t know why she had denied it for so long and denied our help.  To this day my granny now in her 80�s still sits on her porch and remembers that �Muthafucka� and how �she shoulda popped a bullet in his ass while she had the chance.�TL;DR Cousins live down the street with pedo, pedo begins watching my house, comes into our front yard while I�m alone to �make sure I�m safe�, grandpa points a shotgun, mom pops him in the head with a rifle, guy only gets trespassing charges. Leaves town and dies years later in jail.

One time I had to go shit I asked like 9 times. I was letting out little pebbles of shit in separated intervals, when class was over I stood up, and the shit pebbles began falling out of the legs of my pants, through the leg holes in my underwear. I left a trail of shit pebbles all over the floor leading from my seating section all the way out the hallway and halfway down the science hall. They had to quarantine the classroom for the rest of the day.

Ok so one night I was in my room doing a livestream (because I was a YouTube but not anymore) and messages started rolling saying � who�s that man behind you is that your brother or dad � and I said to my self a man well it couldn�t be a brother because I don�t have any siblings and can�t be my dad because he doesn�t live here and I never see him so I look in my camera to see any reflection and my heart sunk the standing at the foot of my bed was a tall black figure so I grab my gun from under my desk ( I have a gun because I�ve been robbed before) I then stand up and turn around but there was nothing there I end the stream and lock my door while turning on my lights and I then sit down and call 911 and report what happened . About 3 minutes later I hear sirens and look outside there was 2 squad cars and a police van there was about 6 or 7 cops they then drew there guns and kick the door open I then hear a lot of shouting and then I hear � get down and drop the weapon NOW � and then gun shots and then a minute later a cop knocks on the door and I unlock the door the police officer then walks in and said �that a man broke in and had a knife and was planning on killing you when we told him to drop the knife and get in the ground he didn�t listen so we had to shoot him he was fine but had to go to the hospital� Still to this day I don�t know why he wanted to kill me, how he got in, how he knew were I lived or who he was.

A few days ago, my best friend came over to hang out. Evidently he came too early so I was still asleep. I normally sleep completely butt naked so you can probably guess why he almost gave me a heart attack. He somehow without me hearing, sees me sleeping, quietly strips down naked too, gets in the bed with me, pulls up the sheets over himself, and lays there next to me for who knows how long. Eventually around the time I start waking up I hear faint breathing and rustling behind me. In my head, half asleep i�m like �What the heck is that?� so I turn around and see my friend completely naked in bed with me. One eye closed and the other half opened. I stare in shock and once it kicked in I jumped off the bed and hit my head on my shoes while my friend is laughing his ass off. Still in shock I silently stare at him while I�m sitting on the floor. He fake-stretches and fake-yawns and says something like �Mornin�, babe~� in a jokingly seductive way and �After breakfast let�s shower together.� I snap out of it and I yell at him for nearly giving me a heart attack. I wasn�t necessarily shocked that he was acting hella gae and laid naked with me for who knows how long I was more shocked that I wasn�t expecting someone right up in my face. Then we kinda laugh together for a bit until I sit next to him to cover myself up with the sheets. I put my arm around his shoulder and with my other hand I throw his pile of clothes at his crotch and tell him to get dressed. We hung out like he wanted to for the rest of the day and we didn�t really talk about it. That was the gayest I have ever felt. Part of me wishes I played along with him and seduced him back and even got on top of him while we�re both nude to give him a taste of his own medicine. Now obviously this was all in good fun but if I�m being honest this made me rethink my sexuality. I�ve been thinkint about what it would be like if I dated him but nah. I told my female friend about it and she thinks he likes me and probably tried sending me an obvious sign. She�s into yaoi and stuff like that so she �ships� us. I don�t think I�m ready to be bi. Besides I don�t even know if this is just one of his jokes or if he�s actually attracted to me. My female friend asked me if I saw him as attractive and thinking about it now, this was one of the few times i�ve seen him shirtless and the first time we�ve seen eachother naked. Looking at his body, he�s honestly kinda cute. Because we�re degenerate losers we still live with our parents but my female friend says that my best friend and I should consider buying a house together and to see if we get romantic or not.(She also said she wanted to live with us but that�s irrelevant to the story). If my friend meant the whole thing as a joke then I hate the fact that i�m slowly considering going bi for him. I never imagined i�d be the type of guy to be attracted to other guys. If he wasn�t joking then should I date him? He�s been my best friend for most of my life since childhood. He�s practically my brother. I�m considering it and my female friend says we�d make a good couple but idk.

This is a story that my mom likes to tell a lot, because it felt like a scene from an action movie. I personally like to tell it too since it was quite funny and traumatizing at the same time.It happened when I was around 8 years old. I went to Vietnam for the summer break to visit family members and alike. My mom and I would often take the taxi to go from place to place (this is quite relevant later). Since I grew up in a western country, I wasn�t very good at speaking Vietnamese, so I just followed my mom everywhere and made sure to not get separated.While we were on our way to another city, the taxi driver informed my mom that he had to pick up medicine on the way. While my mom and I were waiting, she saw a fruit stall along the road and went to go buy some for guests. She told me to stay seated and that she�d be back really quickly, as it was only like 10 meters away. When paying, someone stepped into the car at the driver�s seat and rode off. I started crying and screaming in full panic mode. My mom had already told me to not be separated from her because there were incidents at the time, involving the murder of young girls. And now I�m in a car with a stranger, perhaps never seeing my mom again. In the meanwhile, my mom saw the car drive off and started chasing us by stepping into the first available car, shouting �Follow them! They have my child!�. Now comes the funny part, although it wasn�t funny back then. It�s funny to me now because in the end it was one big misunderstanding. The stranger/driver turned around and stopped immediately when he realized my mom wasn�t there. The reason he didn�t respond to my crying earlier was because he thought my mom had been scolding me while he was away. He was confused and asked �where is your mother?� To which I couldn�t reply as I didn�t know how to speak Vietnamese. I could understand it but not speak it. My mom finally caught up to us and I was crying my eyes out. It turned out that the taxi driver was a family friend. He had been driving us for 90% of the times we took a taxi to another city. I don�t know why I didn�t recognize him. Even if he accidentally drove away with me or without us, my mom could have just called him. I guess at the time it happened it is difficult to think rationally. I was traumatized in the sense that I didn�t dare to wait in cars anymore, and I�m lucky that it was all a misunderstanding. I can laugh about it now because it is quite the experience to me. P.S. I just want to clarify that I don�t think kidnapping is a laughing matter, I am only talking about my own experience.

So I woke up today and I remembered this incident that i will never forget. So it was 8th grade this new hot girl was in my class. We talked for a couple of minutes, exchanged numbers and we were like kinda best friends. When i got back home she texted me for like the whole day we talked alot and shit. Friday, after school she wanted to hangout so we went for a pizza place. We ate and all then she invited me to her house, on my way there my dad called me and told me to get back home so i did. Every time we went out me and the girl she invited me to her house and i didnt go every time for some reason. At the end of that year she left our school. One of my friends then figured out that she and her father were arrested for kidnap and rape! I will never forget how many times she invited me to her house and i didnt go.

We were in our Patriot Period class, and we had to work on computers. I had just gotten back from using the bathroom and logged onto my computer again. I then heard somebody coming into the intercom saying �we�re in a lockdown, this is not a drill, I repeat, this is not a drill� frantically.We all close our computers and run to the corner of the classroom. People are falling down and giggling. We already know what�s happening. People are shushing other students and get down on their hands and knees to pray. I sit across my friend and start to pray with her. Our teacher sits down at his computer typing an email. People whisper things like �I need to text my parents� and �[the teacher] is gonna get us caught.�One girl beside me takes out her phone. Her brightness is on 100 and we all tell her to turn it down. She does, but then a notification comes up in her phone, showing a blinking flashlight. It startles some people as we all make a noise. She texts her mom �I�m in a lockdown. I don�t know if I�ll survive.�I get out my phone and start to text my mom, who works at the other side of the school. She says treat she�s fine, and I text one of my friends from a different school. Her mom also works here, and I tell her that I�m scared for our lives and that there�s a shooter in the school.I get in my friends arms and hug her, whispering things like �I don�t want us to die� and �I want to be safe and okay.�The intercom comes back on again, saying that the threat is gone. We all sign with relief as we get back to our seats. I�m shaking still, and I�m wondering what happened.A few minutes later, the principal comes in, laughing, saying that one of the teachers saw a guy with a PlayStation 2 controller on his desk and thought it was a gun. She ultimately came to conclusions. Who wouldn�t? Our school is known across the county as being in a different town and also for being terribly dangerous. People fight everyday. We�ve had 20 fights this year alone. People joke about shooting our school. And it was on Halloween. I�m just glad that I�m safe.

Well, where should I start? As a young child, I was very shy. According to my mother, she would see other kids playing and interacting with each other while I was in the corner by myself. Around the second grade, my parents pulled me out of public school and enrolled me in a private school. I was able to form a comfort zone within that school and lived happily despite my limitations with interacting with others. Once I turned 16, I got my license and managed to get my first job a month later at a local restaurant.I remember the first day on the job. I was really nervous; my heart was racing as I opened the door. The manager showed me around and told me what I'll be doing. After an hour, he saw I was still nervous so he called me over telling me I can eat a meal from the order he missed up. The delicious meal helped me relax and I was able to continue working. During my time working there, I encountered several pretty girls that gave me butterflies. Of course, I didn't have any experience with girls. Like heck, I never had a date before. Over time my co-workers (all male adults) started poking fun at me because they saw that I really got nervous around girls. Even the high school guys who frequent the restaurant would see my vulnerability and also take advantage. Fortunately, there would be good days when I would get along with my co-workers and the day would carry on smoothly. I remember the first time I "flirted" with a girl. It was on a Sunday. All the girls would dress up nicely and would go to the restaurant after church. This girl went up to the checkout to pay her bill. Of course, I nervously went up to the counter to ring her up. I was thinking about what to say to her five minutes prior. I settled on saying, "Hey, you look nice today." She responded, "Thank You." Nothing else was said. I simply left. After graduating from high school, I went to college. I was excited finally going to a university. I was able to meet a large pool of people. Little did I know, it was going to take a long time before being able to make a friend or two. After the first two semesters, I managed to only have a few acquaintances no friends. I became depressed at times. I saw on Instagram people going to parties having fun. During a class, I noticed a girl staring at me smiling trying to get my attention. I was so nervous that I made an awkward face. She felt the nervousness and looked away. This happened again in the same class with a different girl. At that point, I noticed I wasn't getting anywhere in the "making friends" and "getting a girlfriend" departments. Fast forward three years, my anxiety was still hovering around my mind but I was able to make a few friends during the three years. I finally decided to go to the student health center to seek counseling. I googled around my symptoms and came across the term "social anxiety". I cried as I read the list of symptoms. After two semesters of counseling, I started seeing improvements. I decided to start taking medication. After a few hours after taking the first pill, I noticed my heart wasn't racing when I sat down to take a test. I didn't feel anything. I continued taking the test with no stress. In the next class period, I got my test back and I did well! I was so happy. Now with the help of a pill, I decided it was time to talk to girls. To my surprise, as I approached a girl I seen around campus, my heart started racing again despite having taken my medication before arriving on campus. I kept going and said, "Hello, how are you." Boom! The conversation started flowing from there. After leaving, I was surprised how easy it was to start talking to girls. There wasn't a secret conversation starter or magic word to say. I was blown away.I continued talking to more random girls. Eventually, I started asking for their numbers and most of them (to my surprise) gave it to me. Unfortunately, none of them responded to my texts. Despite this, I kept trying to get more numbers. I started reading articles and books on how to ask girls out on a date. In this outdated book, the author suggests I call her to ask her out on a date. Well, I called her. She answered saying, "Hello." I responded, "Hello (her name), it's me (my name)." She immediately hung up. I spent an hour crying. After letting my emotions out, I started thinking about how to handle the situation. I saw her on campus often. Finally, I decided when I see her I'll say hello and act as nothing happened. It worked! We continued talking as if nothing happened. I realized people don't make it a big deal as long as you don't. During my last semester, I got called out by a professor in front of the whole class because I was risking very expensive lab equipment due to not paying attention. I felt humiliated. Now every time I went to that class after the incident, I felt a rage of anxiety fearing I was going to mess up again. I didn't try to be a better student as I was too busy in despair. I failed the course I didn't receive my degree.At 24 years old, I still haven't gotten my first date and currently working an entry-level job not related to the major I was seeking. The reason I wrote this is because I wanted to exam my life so far. I have been thinking about the choices I made and the consequences. I figured life is like a game of chess. Every choice you make affects the outcome of the game. I figured no matter how many times I lost. I can always play again and become a better player after that last game. Well, I'm ready to play again.Thank you so much for reading.

I�m on phone so sorry for anything and this is my first postI�m in class and I gotta pee, so I do the standard and ask teacher to go and yeah, but when I go in I see this kid sitting leaning up on the urinal on his phone and I think, �He�s just checking his phone� and I don�t think anything of it, when I go in the stall I see him just pull his pants up a bit and leave. But when I walk out the stall, I see a GIANT TURD inside the urinal. I think, �WTF?! He was shitting�? I�m in shock because he shit in the urinal while there were two EMPTY stalls. Then my day goes back to normal but that experience is now stuck my head.

One day, a woman named Kate Wasserman was just about to start cooking dinner when her son arrived home from school.�How was your day, dear?� she asked.�Ugh awful,� the boy groaned. �I�ve got a splitting headache. We were playing soccer and one of the other boys kicked me in the head.��That�s terrible, dear,� his mother said. �Do you want to put some ice on it?��No, that�s OK,� the boy replied. �I�m really tired. I think I�ll just go upstairs and take a nap.��OK, Dinner will be ready in an hour,� she said. �Don�t forget.�A few minutes later, the phone started ringing. Checking the caller ID, she realized the call was coming from a private number.�Hello? Wasserman residence,� she said. �Kate speaking.�She could hear crying on the other end of the line. It sounded like it was a female voice.�Hello? Who is this?� asked Kate.�Please� Please take�� said the female voice on the other end.Then, all of a sudden, the line went dead.The voice sounded very familiar. She was convinced it was someone she knew very well. It sounded like someone in her family. She just couldn�t put her finger on who it was.She immediately called her mother.�Mom, did you just call me, crying?� she asked.�No, of course not, dear,� her mother said.Then, she called her sister.�Mary, did you just call me a minute ago?��No, it wasn�t me,� her sister replied.Kate spent the rest of the night trying to figure out who it was that had called her. She was so perplexed by the anonymous call that she completely forgt about cooking dinner. She was convinced that she recognized the voice. She called every one of her family members and every one of her friends, but they all denied calling her earlier that day.When she went to bed that night, she was still thinking about it.�Maybe it was just a wrong number,� said her husband.�No, that�s just the problem,� Kate replied. �If it was a wrong number, I could just forget about it. But it was the right number. I�m sure of it.�The next morning she found her son dead in his bed. He had died from a brain hemmhorrage. The kick he received during soccer practice caused internal bleeding on his brain and during the night, he had lapsed into a coma and passed away.The woman and her husband were devastated. Neither of them could get over the loss of their beloved son. As time went on, they grew apart and eventually, they divorced. They packed up their belongings, sold their house and went their separate ways.Five years later, Kate was sitting alone in her new house, watching TV when she started thinking about her son. It was the anniversary of his death. She couldn�t believe he had been gone 5 whole years.All of a sudden, something struck her. She leaped out of her chair, rushed into the hallway and grabbed the phone.She dialled the number of her old house and listened to it ring and ring.Then, someone answered and she heard a familiar voice on the other end say:�Hello? Wasserman residence. Kate speaking.�She stood there dumbfounded, tears streaming down her cheeks. She was so shocked, she could barely speak.�Hello? Who is this?� said the voice on the other end.Kate took a deep breath. �Please� Please take�� she said.Just then, the line went dead.�Please take him to the hospital!� she screamed.She tried the number again and again, but all she got was a recorded message saying the line was no longer in service.

So this was last week. Me and four of my friends were at the gym and I was not taking it too serious and I belly flopped on the jumping cube and the gym teacher guy got mad and kicked me out. A few minutes later my friends came out and we got bored and started walking around. We walked down to an old school that closed down last year. We went around it looking for open windows and doors. We jumped over a fairly big fence that lead us to the back. My friend had trouble climbing over the fence. We went around and found a few open windows but they all were child safety so they opened like 2 inches. After a while we were about to give up when we found 3 metal bars. Me and 2 of my friends pushed on a window with it and got it open a good bit. We all climbed into the school and started messing around. (Looking at old computers and just having a bit of fun) anyway later on there was a locked door so I got the metal bar and smashed the window on it in hopes of opening it from the other side, but then decided that I did not want to stick my hand through glass.I then found a fire extinguisher and started spraying it around the place. I remember my friend said, �are you stupid there is a fire alarm right there?� I laughed at him and said nothing will happen... I was wrong, very wrong. A couple minutes later we are all talking in the hall and the fire alarm starts blaring! We all stop for 1 second and start sprinting. 4 of my friends went through the tiny window (one of them was taking too long so my other friend pushed him out the window) and I went out a door that sets off the fire alarm when opened (but the fire alarm was already set off so it did not matter) We all start climbing the fence and run off but one my friends could not get over him self so my other friend had to help him over. (Later on he was annoyed at me for leaving him behind xD)Anyway we went down to a little shop and sat there for a while waiting to see if a fire truck goes by. After an hour we don�t see any fire truck and my friends dad picks us up and drops us all home. And we thought we were in the clear.(we were not)The next day my friend was coming home from training and there was 5 cars outside the school and a police van. Luckily the police where I live are absolutely useless so I think we are ok.TL;DR broke into school and set off fire alarm and police are looking for me.Edit please keep at 69 upvotes. My friend said if I get 69 upvotes he will do transition year.

I have a story that I told to many of my friends. And now, this story will be here, on Reddit. This is the story that made me pissed the most in all my miserable life. I'm also sorry for my bad english, I'm French Canadian, but I can also talk english, but I'm still learning it. It happend years ago, in 2013, when my little sister was borned. In my family, we are 4 kids. Me (18), my two brothers, (22&14) and my sister (7). I was pretty happy when I learn that I was about to have a sister. But my little brother, that's a no no. When she was born, my parents take care of her all the time. Me and my older brother knows that we are old enough to take care of ourselfs, even if we sometime fight each other.My young brother was pretty jealous when my sister got all the attention from my parents. For me, seeing my sister getting attention of the parents was not a huge deal for me. But for him, it was war. A month later, I was in my class, in elementary school, waiting for lunch. 5 minutes before the bell rings, I got called in the principal's office. I was never called there that year, except for that day. So, I slowly walk, as I get in the office, then I was a woman that I NEVER saw before. She work for some child protection services or something but I never knew that till I got older. She said that she wanted to go with me and my brother to the hospital (she worked there). At first, I was nervous because STRANGER DANGER! But the principal said that she knows the woman really well. She was a little old (maybe like 45 years old) but really really nice. She tooked us to the hospital, as we waited almost 2 hours. I was in a room, with my brother. I was feeling concerned about what is going on. When she called me, I walk in her office. I sit and then she asked me something that make me in a huge confusion ;"Is that true that your father is beating you and your younger brother...?" [Our father NEVER beats us. NEVER.]I was a little shocked at first, but I replied with ;"No. But, our mother lighty beat us with a wooden spoon when we were younger because we were acting like devils."Her mouth dropped, as I though that this is gonna put us in trouble. It does. She then said ;"I'm sorry, but I have to put you all 3 of you in foster care..."MY mouth dropped. I said it was a misunderstanding, but she didn�t want to hear anything! And my foster parents was a couple (mostly the woman of the couple) that baby-sitted me when I was a baby. And it was that moment that I knew that I won't see my parents for a long time..... this lasted for 3 to 4 months. The most depressed period of my life ; Being snached from our parents because of my little brother's lie. The first month was the worse, but with the foster mother that I know for years, I was able to pass that depressing moment, but not for a long time... I didn't tell everybody, not even my parents until now, that I tried to commit suicide by hanging(this is not for adding drama in the story. I was just depressed as f**k. I thought that I'll never see my family again). The day of my "supposed death", it was break time. I was in the school yard, as I walk in a small forest. A rope in my hand. After everything was ready, I was finally ready to leave this non-believing world. As I jumped, with the rope around my neck, I land on the ground. I then notice that the rope was too long(also a little too thin, it would break anyway). God want me to suffer more.After 2/3 weeks in this house, I was told that I'm going to be now with my 2 cousins. I was REBORNED, because I love spending time with thoses girls. And when I moved in there house, they treated me like if I was another part of the family. The problem, is I HATE it when I live in a place that is not my own house, with my OWN parents... I kinda feel alone even if I'm with my uncle and aunt... After 3 months, I was finally back with my parents! My nightmare was finally over... And years later, I learn that was because of my brother who was JEALOUS of my sister and told everybody in the city that our father beat us! I wanted to beat him to half death. But now, he's pretty cool. But I still kinda hate him. Because that experience gave me some mental issues...Thank you for reading this strange sad story. If you want more information about that experience, comment and I'll replied it with all my honesty.~~~~~~~~~~Edit ; Thank you for all the questions and support you gave me... But, I'm already okay and pass to another thing now. So, you don't need to support me, but I'll accept questions!

My name is Alicia. I live in Hell, aka Arizona, and have for as long as I can remember; though I was born in West Virginia. I learned a few years ago that I was supposed to be adopted to family friends in Maryland. They had a nursery set up for me, a big family reunion type party planned, all the legal/adoption fees had been paid, everything was all set up. My mother was 18 at the time & felt she couldn't adequately care for me, especially considering her tumultuous relationship with my sperm donor. My older brother ended up not belonging to my sperm donor, but for some reason he was convinced that I was different (sadly I am biologically his). Had my mother not listed him as my father on my birth certificate, I'd have grown up as Erin Marie Thompson in Maryland & probably wouldn't be the fucked up mess that I am today. But she did list him & moments after I was born and put into my almost-adoptive-mother's arms, my sperm donor refused to sign the papers, stating that I was his and nobody else would raise me. My almost-adoptive-parents were so devastated they never tried to adopt again and have no children to this day. I grew up living with my sperm donor as he had most of the resources to care for me compared to my mother, but he was negligent and mentally abusive. I looked forward to alternating weekends that I spent with my mother, who was loving and attentive. She died 2 months before my 12th birthday from an accidental morphine overdose. It's kinda funny my sperm donor prevented my adoption and made such a huge deal about keeping me, because he ended up absolutely hating me for no reason. He still treats me like garbage to this day. Nobody understands, especially because when my older brother died of Leukemia, my sperm donor did seem interested in being a parent. I was a "daddy's girl" by all accounts until he met his current wife when I turned 5. That's when the neglect/abuse began, and it never ceased. Everyone thought after losing a child he'd cherish the one he had left. Funny how things work out sometimes. I know this probably isn't nearly as interesting to others as it is to me, but I don't know where else I could talk about this.

It�s not a secret, or a confession..It�s me not believing what I did.I am locked, I deserve what is happening to me.My name is Raymond, I killed an innocent guy with a knife, I did it because I wanted to do it, I did it because I am evil.He was young, I remember it clearly, I might be loosing my mind but trust me when I say I remember him, He had a red hat, blue coat and was wandering infront of my window at night, I didn�t know his name, but I knew I was angry, I was mad, I needed to do something, I raged towards him with a knife, I do remember the knife, it was really sharp, it hurt.I called him in, I stabbed him too many times he couldn�t even scream from the pain, I do remember the pain.I watched him die. And I cried.I don�t know why I did it, I think I hated him, I hated his hat, I hated that he was alone. i hated how easily he trusted me when I came towards him, I expected him to fight, to yell, to be surprised But he didn�t feel anything at all, He was numb.It�s like he wanted it. He needed it.I don�t want to say he deserved it, because after all. I wish I was him.I wish it was me who died.I wish I drew the knife to my heart. I wish I was the guy with the blue coat. And you know what�s funny, I sometimes dream of wearing the same coat.Doctor Garry said that it was my coat, I asked him if he�s saying that the guy stole it, I begged him not to justify what I did, But he said something and I don�t know where it came from, he said the guy�s name is Raymond, He told me he tried to kill himself, he told me he used a knife to hurt himself, he told me he was in pain, and he deserved so much love and happiness,I couldn�t care less about who I was or who he was.I just was grateful to know that it didn�t work, the knife didn�t kill him. Raymond lived. And that�s all what matters.

So first of all i'm german so my english could be much better and second of all it's my first post on reddit so dont expect to much. But that's not important. I just whitnessed one of the funniest situations of my life. So I (15) have to share a room with my sister (11) at my dads place. its 02:45 right now. And she should be asleep and she was but then something crazy happened. So I was Face-Timing with my gf. But suddenly my sister jumped off her bed. She had a really strange facial expression like she was high. I asked her what the problem is but she was kinda annoyed and said that it's nothing. Me and my gf being really confused but just continuing on talking. Then a few seconds later my sis is putting on her hoodie like if it was a pair of pants. I ask her what she's doing and she tells me still annoyed that she's putting on her pants. I tell her that the hoodie isn't her pants but she just doesn't believe me and says im lying. So first i thought it was a joke but then she pulls the hoodie up to the height of her  chest. Then she suddenly stopped because she realised that these aren't her pants. Then she gets out of them and goes to f cking sleep in no time. Me an my gf were so f cking confused had had to laugh so f cking much. I'm still really confused but it was such a funny moment. I will talk with her about it when she's awake and give you guys an update if it's interesting. But goodnight guys i need some sleep now because im confused af.

I had just turned fourteen, and I was on a camping trip with my church, we call it high adventure. We went to a lake up in northern Idaho, and just camped and kinda chilled, one day me and another kid who couldn�t swim went down to the lake, he was just there to be my �buddy�. Anyway I was just jumping off the dock and swimming around a little bit, and I was an alright swimmer but not in the best shape. While I was swimming I saw a man get into the lake with his son, who was maybe 3/4 years old. They were in a one man kayak with the man paddling. His son was sitting in front of him on the kayak and because of that he was hitting his son with the paddle and having a hard time paddling. I didn�t think much of it, just kinda chuckled. I kept swimming and just diving into the water, and after I had dove off a few times I came back up, and the other boy that was with me ran over kind of panicked. He said � I think that man needs help� so I got up onto the dock and I could hear him screaming a high pitched help. He had flipped his kayak and his son and him were both in the water, and I guess he couldn�t swim. Because his yell was so high pitched it sounded almost comical and I couldn�t tell if he actually needed help or if he was just messing with his son. I yelled out and asked if he needed help and he responded back yes. Instantly I got an adrenaline surge and without thinking jumped into the water. I had never and still haven�t swam that far that fast, it took me probably 30 seconds or less to swim out probably fifty yards. When I got out there I asked the man what he needed me to do, he told me to grab his son and swim him back. Thankfully his son had a life jacket on our neither of us probably would have made it. With one arm I grabbed the back of his life jacket and with the other ( and my legs) I started swimming another 50 yards back to shore. I dropped the kid off with the other boy there, then swam back out to the man to see if he needed anything else. They went out to go fishing so I grabbed as much fishing supplies as I could and helped swim him back. Just as I got back to the shore with everything my leaders showed up, so I got a little bit of recognition which was kinda nice. But at that point I was shaking and exhausted, so I went back to camp, changed and promptly passed out and had a two hour nap.

So I was just cleaning up and getting ready for our next surgery. After I was done, I went to see the other animals to know how many we had left to do (i'm not the surgeon btw). This one cat caught my eye. She was black and white and had this chill look in her eyes. Me and my sister were making jokes about this cat and how you could feel the chill vibes radiating off her. We were complete strangers to her and she let us pet her like if it was nothing. I was like "Finally! A cat I can relate to!". I later asked the main surgeon why this cat had such a different attitude. Turns out she was just preggo. :(

For context I'm 17 (turning 18) m. I jogged through all of a college campus, went to doctor's office (with a mask on as I walk in), and Walmart. Walmart lady kindly told me, "Excuse me sir, do you know that you ripped your pants?" Completely ripped in the backside. Needless to say, I was thankful for her telling me, and she was thankful that I wasn't annoyed at her (which ig means she must have been debating with herself whether or not to say anything at all -- "will I lose my job over this kid possibly being a jerk?"

My algebra teacher has to deal with shit not only from students, but from administration. One day I walk into class and I see a sub. Seems normal, but she doesn't show up for nearly 2 months. Rumours started spreading, some about her daughter, others say she hit a student. When she came back, she explained what happend. She was fuckin' put on probation cuz some little bastard lied to the admin and got away with it. Said little bastard along with some other kids said she did things she never did all because they're intimidated by her. She wasn't allowed to talk to anybody associated with the school, not even her own students. In her absense, some other kids decided to be assholes and stole half the students' whiteboards, markers, and even took the bathroom pass and hand sanitizer. And she even found out about the rumours and the only person she told was the principal. To this day, I'm still pissed off at that little shit that lied about teacher. All this shit happened because of that one little shit.

When i was young, around 8 or 9; i used to play Call of Duty: Black Ops on my Wii. I was addicted to the online portion of it and i was surprisingly well. My neighbour, my brother, and I always played turns on it even though my neighbour had the same game on playstation(this is important). One week i had to leave for camping, and i played my last round of online cod then left. I know that my neighbour knew where the keys were for the house because when we chilled after school i had to unlock the doors and it was always hidden at the same place. When i came back from camping, and started the wii up, i noticed i have full stats on everything, and i was even prestiged to the max; even the guns had max stats and all atachments unlocked. I have been lead to one conclusion; my neighbour grinded Call of Duty on my Wii while i was gone. tldr; my neighbour broke into my house and played Call of Duty black ops on my wii while i was gone for camping.

It has been a while since it happened and I think it�s high time I told someone anyone. It�s not like anyone is going to read this anyway. If you are reading this I urge you to keep yourself safe on the internet and don�t let yourself fall into my trap. Also I�m sorry for spelling and grammar I have really bad dyslexia.So when I was 12 I was part of a Minecraft server community, it was very tight nit and we knew everyone there. We all operate off of Skype and all of us played together a lot. I had fun and built some cool shit with my friends but this was something that went sour fast. One user send me a DM and he started talking to me, he said he was a 12 year old boy but he never joined any voice chats so I didn�t know, I just assumed that he was telling the truth and that was the first red flag I missed. We started chatting and playing a lot together, he didn�t want me to play with any of the others and got really angry when he saw me playing with them, this was the second red flag I missed. He then started to get rather pushy and said he wanted to meet up with me so that we could talk, he first asked if I could come over but I said no and as soon as I said that he went off on a rage saying that I was a bad friend, this was my third red flag I missed. Soon after that he started asking me to play with a girls skin and he game me a rather garish skin which was one that I didn�t want to use because I was and still am a boy. He pressured me into using it and when I eventually did he started getting intimate saying that I should stay in the house and not go out because I was the woman of the house, then he said that we had to sleep in the same room to safe space and so on and so on. At this time he asked me to move onto another app I hadn�t used before.  This went on until he started asking me to rp having sex with him, which at that point I said no, this is when things got bad. He then started to send me pictures, starting with a picture of my house, then one of the back of my house, then me at school and finally pictures of my family, my dad at work, my mum with my little brother, my big brother at boarding school and then finally use all together eating Sunday lunch. He then started saying that if I didn�t do what he said he would murder all my family and then finally kill me. At this time I had also been sent to boarding school so I had no way of knowing how close he was to them. So... I agreed to do as he says. DISCLAIMER: This is where it gets bad... so please be warned that some of the stuff your about to read is horrific and still makes me want to cry today. Over the next few days he told me to do a few different things, first he wanted me to steal some girls clothes from the lockers and when I said that I didn�t want to he sent back the phrase �You don�t have a choice slut.� This came up a lot over these 4 years. So I did as he asked, I took the clothes and when I had them he told me to put them on and �Show your master that cute body of yours�, I had no choice I had to send him pic after pic of me in the clothes I stole and eventually he said he was going to bed and that he would contact me in the morning. That night I cried myself to sleep, the first of many nights where I would cry until I passed out. After that he went on and on asking me to do things to my body that got increasingly more and more dark until he made me take a razor to my belly and write �Slave� across it, the worst  part was that he wanted it to be deep so that it would scar, in my mind I though that if I didn�t he would hurt my family and from what he told me it was better that I suffered instead of all of them. After a while he started to tell me in great detail what he wanted to do to me, how he wanted to hurt me, here is a list of some of the things he wanted to do to me just so that you know what kind of a sick monster he was.Things he wanted to do to me where: Cut off my arms and legs because and I quote  �You won�t need them for what I want you for�, he wanted to shove a red hot poker up my ass to listen to my screams, tie me up and pour acid over me till he had his fun, make a horse fuck me, force me to become his toilet and so much fucking more. He even kept saying that he wanted to chop me up and cook me when he was bored with me!Those 4 years my life was ruined, I didn�t eat I barely slept, I had to send pic after pic instead of doing my homework because �You are too much of a bimbo to do anything other than be my sex toy� so my class work went down hill, and the worst part was that I couldn�t tell my family or teachers because he said that he would know if I did it and he would do everything he wanted to do to me to all of my family. And I ducking believed him. I know what your going to ask, why not just block him? Why not just call the police? Because he made me thing that if I told the police that I would be the one that would go to jail because I stole girls clothes, he also said that if I blocked him he would just target my family. And again I fucking believed him!!! I was young and scared and now that I look back I was rather stupid to believe him, but he knew where I lived so what else could I do? This all got worse and worse until I turned 16 and a few days after that I was talking to him and asking him why he didn�t just kidnap me, this is when he messed up, he said that if he kidnapped me now he would be found and sent to jail. In that moment his web was broken. He would not ever make a move against my family because he was a coward he was never going to do anything. He was full of empty threats and then in that moment of rational thinking I called him out on it and said that I was going to go to the police. In truth I just wanted him to be scared off and to just leave me alone, I didn�t want to tell anyone else about what happened because I felt far too humiliated by what I had done and sent to ever tell anyone, after I called him out he deleted his account. And the thing about this app is that when you delete your account it removes all of your messages so when I refreshed the page everything was gone. To this day I regret not taking it to the police but for two years now nothing has happened and I have had no contact from him or ever seen him. I am a happier person now that I have him out of my life and I am looking to work at GCHQ when I leave UNI which I�m going to at the end of this year. To everyone who has or is experiencing this now just know that your not alone and it�s always better to get help as well as never taking these perverted pieces of shit seriously. Most if not all of them are far too cowardly to do anything. Thanks for reading and I hope that my story helps to keep people safe in the future.

My parents went on vacation for a week and left my sis(21) in change of me. At the time I was 15 years old, male btw, and my sis and I were really close. So during this week long gap without our parents we would do bets to keep ourselfs entertained. As the days passed the bets kept getting harder and the stakes higher until I finally lost one. And the punishment...be a girl for 4 days until my parents got home. So, my sister made me a girl. Throughout the day I was feminized, I had to shave my arms, legs, put on a bra, panties, makeup, fake breasts, hair extensions, nail polish, etc. After hours of this they we�re finally finished. When I was able to look in the mirror I was in awe, I looked like a complete girl, if I didn�t tell anyone I was a dude they would have never guessed, I already had girlish features but wow. Let me tell you, being a girl for 4 days was quite an experience but I guess that�s a story for a different time.

It was back then in 2nd grade I was trying to hide from a bully that really wanted my ass beaten up. So I tried to hide from him and I thought "Hey why not hide in the girl's Restroom" so I did. When I was hiding in one of the stalls a girl opened it and at first, I thought "Shit, she's going to report me" then the sweetest voice I heard from the wide world. "what are you doing here" she asked then I told her a short story of how I ended up there then she asked my name and I was just silent. After seconds of silence, she introduced her self "My name is Hailey" and she stayed for a while until I decided to come out. I'm now 14 and to this day I still have a crush on that girl, sadly back in April she left to go to her province and I hoped that she will come back.

True story: I have suffered from IBS for most of my life, and have experienced more than my fair share of gastrointestinal nightmares in the worst possible times and places, so today I am going to tell you about just one of them. When I was in 8th grade, we only had 2-3 minute breaks in between classes. I was in choir for 5th period, and the choir room was all the way on the opposite side of the building from the rest of my classes. On this particular day, I had been suffering from some pretty nasty stomach cramps. It sucked, but it was nothing terribly out of the ordinary. Choir class came to an end and I had to haul ass across the building in 2 minutes to make it to my English class. My English teacher was a total bitch and would often resort to ridicule and passive aggressive humiliation when dealing with students she didn't favorite. I often made fun of her to my friends, insulting her for always wearing the same striped, cotton turtle necks to hide her double chin. This might sound cruel on my part, but she was the type of teacher who favorited the popular, smart kids, and just had a shitty cynical attitude for any student who was less than perfect in her eyes. Anyway, in just 2 minutes I had to run across the school, go to my locker to switch my books, and make it to this bitch's dumbass class on time. Once I got to my locker it suddenly hit me that I had to pee really bad. I knew I was really running low on time and did not want to divert to the nearby restroom, but the building pressure in my gut made me realize I had little choice. Once I got to the bathroom I knew I was probably going to be late already, so I knew I had to empty my bladder in record time. In a rush of pure adrenaline and anxiety I pushed my pee out as hard and as quickly as I could. Apparently I pushed just a little too hard and I soon felt what can only be described as some of my pee leaking out of my ass and running down my leg. I immediately felt mortified and realized I had just squirted liquid shit all the way down my pant leg. It was the consistency of pure water and it smelled like propane, sulfur, and burnt tires. Nevertheless, I was so scared of my English teacher and missing/being late to class, that I ended up JUST RUNNING TO CLASS ANYWAY.I arrived with seconds to spare, and promptly sat down in my own liquid shit, hoping no one around me could smell the demonic fumes eminating from my jeans. Our desks in this class were clustered together in pairs (Just fucking perfect, right?!) and I happened to be seated next to this really cute girl who made me super nervous. I kept looking at her out of the corner of my eye to monitor her expression, hoping to God she couldn't smell what I could smell. At this particular time in my English class, we were studying the history and culture of slavery in 1800s America, and Ms. Fat Turtle Neck Bitchface made us sing   "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" as a class. I was absolutely petrified, and, not wanting to draw any attention to myself, could only mouth the words under my breath as my vocal chords remained paralyzed in fear. My dumb bitch of an English teacher didn't care to realize I had just come from choir and would normally have no problem singing out loud. She always seemed to single me out because, to be fair, I frequently missed assignments and didn't pay attention in class. So, to my horror, she came over and got her face super close to mine and made a sarcastic, angry smile, trying to force me to sing audibly. My anxiety just grew worse and I honestly could've passed out at this point from the pressure and potential humiliation. My forehead began producing beads of sweat, and I could feel myself blushing as I sat staring blankly ahead like a deer in the headlights. I stayed super still, trying avoid further agitating the pool of anal leakage in my pants and emitting even more toxic fumes into the space around me. The rest of the day went mostly okay, and I just kinda kept quiet and watched the clock in anticipation for when I could go home, change my pants, and relieve the mounting pressure in my bowels. Luckily I only had to get through one more easy class period and a bus ride before I could find the solace of my own commode. When I got home, I finally let out the rest of my shit, come to find out it was WHITE (I didn't tell anyone this at the time, but apparently that's a sign of liver failure or something, but it never happened to me again, so idk).Anyway, I know this is a funny story, but I just can't believe sitting in my own diarrhea for 3 hours seemed like a better option to me than going to the nurse's office and facing the awkwardness of what had happened to me. I think it says a lot about how terrifying navigating the school system can be for kids who have anxiety and/or gastrointestinal problems, many of whom, like me, would rather just suffer in silence. Anyone else relate??

So my girlfriends mom really hates me neither I, nor my girlfriend knows why. For the record, we had only met once, before I was dating her daughter (at this time she had only good things to say about me and even suggested to her daughter that she should date me). So I assumed that her hatred towards me was because I was dating her daughter, you know, regular protective parent stuff. Turns out that I was wrong. Earlier today she suggested to my girlfriend, "you can date other people behind his back, it's not like he needs to know."I genuinely wish I was joking or even just exaggerating, this is probably the most fucked up thing to happen to me. I thought her problem was that her daughter may be having sex, but apparently now she's suggesting that her daughter have more sex behind my back.I've only met her mom once briefly as mentioned so I can't even confront her about this.I genuinely do not know what to do right now, suggestions welcome

Do you remember being indestructible?  I do.   I would ski as fast as I could and crash on purpose.  One day during a crash I felt the lower leg bone stress up BIG and I heard a Blam!  I thought I broke my leg!  I had broken the ski into an L shape.  In those days there were no ski brakes, just long straps.  So I splinted the broken ski (held together only by the steel edges) to the good ski with the long straps, and returned those skis in a crowded return pile-up.  I could not afford to buy those skis and I made a quick exit from the rental building.

That reminds me of a story. I just got back to Houston after a particularly arduous 60-day long 28-day hitch out in Siberia. I was done in. Finito. Fuckered. Flamed-out. I've been going on jobs back-to-back-to-back for about 14 months and I decided to say: �fuck this�. The phone's going off the hook and I'm taking some downtime for the next�whatever. The kids are in school, they�re doing well; the prime marital unit barely recognizes me and I feel like I've spent more time in airport bars and hospitality centers than at home of late.Which was far too true.Stumbling through the door after a heart-skippingly amusing and expensive ride from the airport, I inform my wife that �Daddy�s home!� I also tell her �Yes, I know I owe you big-time for your patience and riding-herd alone on the house, the kids, etc.� She�s pleased with these facts and also relieved. Relieved she's not going to be done over for spousal homicide.The Alexandrite earrings and pendant set I�d had fashioned for her at Diadema in St. Petersburg didn�t hurt, either. I inform her it�s road trip time; who doesn�t love an extemporaneous road trip?So, without as much as a �by your leave�, I impulsively throw some of our clothes in a suitcase, toss a case or two of Spotted Cow (plus a couple of jugs of Wild Turkey Rye) in a cooler, and we take off in the Rover. We just point it west and let it take us where it will.We spent a brilliant couple of carefree weeks in the wilds of New Mexico. We own a spread out in the Sangre de Christo range where I have some far-out latter-day hippie friends living in and taking care of the property and the fish until such time I ever decide to retire.We drift over to Taos to check out the Navajo turquoise jewelry scene, then out �round Albuquerque-way to visit some present-day friends. Once sobered up, we head out to Vernal, UT to visit some Jurassic friends. While we were in the neighborhood, I take us up on Cripple Creek to check a couple of my grubstakes; then down, around, and over, to the Hill Country of Texas.We were taking in the local county fairs (bloody hell, Hummels ain�t cheap�), scenery, beer, and cuisine of the region. Remember, this was the period before GSMs and cell phones, so I was essentially incommunicado because I refuse to carry a fax machine around with me and pagers-beepers were just too silly to give much thought.Unfortunately, I did have Telex and fax machines back home on the Kingwood estate; and it looked like they�ve been left on interstellar overdrive. There�s also several sternly official-looking business-delivery �Where the fuck was you?� notes plastered around various entrances admonishing me for not being home to receive the incredibly important packages and messages they�re currently holding for me.Retrieving all these missives, messages and memos; I sort them thusly: Junk, junk and, hey, more junk.No, I do not want to invest in North Korean pork-belly futures.No, I don�t want a chance at winning $US6.02x1023 by subscribing to �Better Gnomes and Gardens�.No, I really don�t want to look into furthering my education at the local community college by training in something called �programming languages�. Yeah, like that�s going to ever be a thing�There were, however, a couple of parcels that actually grabbed my interest.There was this peculiarly official-looking package from South America, from a very �silvery� country down there.It was from the offices of �Yacimientos Petrol�feros Fiscales� sent off by a Major General Jorge de Altamesa de Aye Carumba de Padwajuan Mar�an Steverino L�pez de Santa Anita in the Fifth y P�rez de Lebr�n, Junior; the �Ministro de Energ�a y Miner�a de la Rep�blica Argentina.��Ah! Must be fan mail. How nice.�Upon opening the packages, I thought it might be another of those just becoming popular Nigerian-royalty scams to invest in some oil deals with a possible potential of prodigious probabilities. Upon closer examination, it wasn�t. It was a personal invitation for me to visit Argentina, specifically Buenos Aries, to discuss the prospect of my doing a little consulting work for the national oil company.After closer inspection, I see it wasn�t for just a little consulting work; they basically wanted me to relocate with my family (i.e., go the old Expat route again) to Buenos Aires (BA) to take over and lead to glory the exploration activities of the national company which, truth be told, was just emerging from a rather rocky epoch. Across South America, there was a precipitous decline in oil production and an increase in imports which continued throughout the 70s and 80s. These were difficult decades, particularly for Argentina, in political and economic terms, with intermittent military governments and frequent economic crises.�Hey, sign me up!� I re-joined sarcastically to the wife.We discuss the matter and decide that since spring break was coming up, that if nothing else, we should all trek down to BA. It would be fun and educational for the kids; though I�ve worked in Argentina before, my wife and children have never been there. I was already looking forward to lunch at Caba�a Las Lilas and the re-awakening of my inner carnivore. Take it from a native, though displaced, Cheesehead; these characters really know how to cow down there�Since they were enjoying an uptick in the Argentinian economy, the company sends one of their spiffy-new corporate jets to Houston Intergalactic to wing my family and me southward. This is the only way to fly. Forget Business Class, forget First Class, this is �Holy Fuck! We have an entire plane to ourselves Tony Stark class�.An expertly efficient, friendly and obviously well-informed (they had laid in a supply of Bitter Lemon (plus adjuncts) just for me) flight crew made the ten-hour flight just, ahem, fly by. We were all fresh and relaxed as we deplaned into Aeropuerto Internacional Ministro Pistarini, where we were whisked through visa, customs, and all that passport control trumpery. Even our luggage followed us there without incident, which was truly refreshing.In a company car, we were transported briskly, though not so hurriedly as to preclude any quick sightseeing, to our Executive-suite in the Palacio Duhau Hotel. This joint was your typical bog-standard 5-star luxury sort of byzantine brick-pile (I am being excessively facetious here; it was extraordinarily posh, especially to this old Oil Patch denizen) as the wife and kids instantly fell in love with all there was to see and do; particularly since it was on the company�s nickel.Before we flew over, the folks at the oil company with whom I was being interviewed, surreptitiously (or so they thought) kept asking about the wife and kids: what were their interests, what did they like to do in their free time, where did they like to go�? Of course, I mentioned how my eldest was rather an accomplished English dressage rider (we owned several riding horses scattered around the American Southwest�here�s a note for all you aspiring horse owners: �Never own something that can eat while you sleep�).Also, I stated that my youngest was a fledgling aspiring artist and held a genuine interest in all forms of art; particularly those that were dark. Finally, I remarked that my wife held several advanced degrees in cooking and a black belt in both clothes and shoe shopping.I was informed that in no way was I to be concerned that my family would either get bored or be tired of the itinerary the company had set up for them while I was doing business at their offices. While thrashing out not only my contract with them but venturing my initial impressions of how to get the hometown oil company back on track and in the black, they put their covert plan into action.My family was scheduled to go boating, swimming, shopping, horseback riding, shopping, visit local art museums and galleries, go shopping and basically play tourist while I, once again, had my honker honed on the proverbial grindstone.It was especially dirty pool when they had a pair of custom-leather riding boots crafted for Daughter #1, set up tutoring and talk-time with some local artists for Daughter #2. They also prepared maps and transport that would have not looked out of place at any military infantry invasion for my wife�s shopping forays.Damn, these characters were either really desperate or really devious; probably both.After a load of legal and interpersonal wrangling, we finally shake hands on a 3-year, open-ended consulting agreement. I was to assume the title of Senior Exploration Manager (Domestic) and my Force Majeure, Take-or-pay, it-is-what-it-is occasionally-extortionate contract was signed and sealed by all.Happy campers all around, we celebrated at one of the local carnecer�as where Bos taurus could have been placed on the endangered species list. As I noted previously, these guys really know how to cow down here.Since this would require an unusually long period of Expat-ness for us, we decided to put most of our Texas personal effects into storage and farm out the ol� Houston homestead to some Estate Agents who would rent out our digs in our absence. They would be taking care of both tenancy and repairs, if needed, and only taking a paltry 23.5% cut of monthly rent in return for their services. At least they could have provided a little Astro-Glide for the initial �service� they provided�My wife and I decided that the kids should finish out their school year (only a couple more months until summer break) in the US since it was paid for already. We, however, would scoot down to BA to find a place to live and my wife could bring into force her not inconsiderable shopping skillset and set-up housekeeping. We had several places pre-scouted for us by my company so less than two weeks later, we�re touring the town, and inspecting those places that might pass muster where we would be comfortable in calling home.We have semi-eclectic tastes: we�re American, big in stature and voice, and require a fair amount of room. Our request for a 5 or 6-bedroom villa with pool and hot tub was reacted to by collective gasps and looks of astonishment (mostly regarding their commissions) from the leasing agents.Surprisingly, after turning down the first half-dozen villas shown by the agents, they remark: �Senor, there�s this one villa out in Casa 1890 San Telmo�it�s a bit costly and no one we�ve ever shown before has even considered it��I glance over at the wife, �Well, let�s go have a look.��Senor y Senora�it is kind of pricey���I�m just here to set up my family and my company is paying for accommodation�OK?�Magic code words indeed. We were briskly whisked there and shown a most comfortable looking, cozy little 5-bedroom villa in a rather cosmopolitan part of town that just so happened to be within walking distance (yeah, as if it would ever come to that�) of the office.Three-floors thick, with a huge well-appointed kitchen. A natty three-car attached garage. Walk-in closets in every bedroom, lots of marble and real wood accents, a nice third floor-space for my office, gated with a forward-looking security building, big rooms for the kids, manicured lawn and garden, a hot tub and pool�this place had it all.�We�ll take it�, I told them after a half-hour�s worth of walkthrough.�It�s is not inexpensive.��Yep, and I�m OK with that.��Gas, water, electricity and sewer are going to add a monthly additional���OK, no problem. We�ll take it.��Security is also going to cost���Not a problem, that�s already covered by my company as per my contract...��Ah! Anything else?��Yeah, for the first couple of months, we�re going to need a car and driver (for the family, mine was taken care of by the company), a housemaid or two for laundry and general house cleaning, and someone to go to the markets weekly for food and the like��With visions of neatly-wrapped piles of banknotes Tangoing in their heads, �Ummm�certainly, sir. Anything else? ��Yeah. I need maps to the nearest off-license and cigar shop.� Y� know, the essentials�Our container arrived from Texas late the next month and our children followed shortly after. They would be going to school in 3 months hence at the International American School of Buenos Aires (�Lincoln School�). However, in the interim, my eldest had desires to go visit one of her horse riding buddies in Sweden for the summer. Not to be outdone, my in-laws desired to take our youngest to Germany to visit family she�s never met and better learn the language.This means, that, gasp, we�d be all alone for three months. What should we do?My wife and I wave �Adios!� to our children as they jet off to Houston, join the in-laws, then onto points European.Well, time progressed as is its wont. My wife had an absolute blast shopping and outfitting our new place ostensibly to get it �ordnunked� for when the children returned. With virtually zero-ticks in the culture-shock department, we took to living in BA like an old geologist takes to a new perpetual-Happy Hour gin mill. We found some of the finest housemaids BA had to offer and a driver that promised to avoid driving like Joie Chitwood, and he also spoke great English. Things looked like they�re to be going just swell�Then, the Argentine economy once again stubbed its collective toes and very-fluid excrement began to impact that rapidly rotating air-moving device.Of course, as a national oil company, the first thing you do in a situation like this is freak the fuck out. After that subsides, you panic. If still conscious, you give into anxiety, look everywhere for both scapegoats to blame this mess on and ways to cut spending of any and all monies.�Ummm�Mr. Rocknocker. We need to talk�� one of the more dickheaded Directors squeaks as he warily wanders into my office.�Yes?��Given the current economic climate, what is happening in the Middle East (it�s always the Middle East�) and with other oil exporting countries, we�ve been experiencing a bit of�an economic downturn. I�m afraid that we�re going to have to re-evaluate the company�s direction and our projects currently slated for this and subsequent fiscal years���Yeah, that�s the dribbling shits, ain�t it? Well, let me know how that goes.��Ah. Well, ummm, we were discussing your current 20-well exploratory drilling program. We are going to have to evaluate the project, existing monetization, your team, and all contracts currently in force.�Ok, I see where this is going.�Wait one. I�ll save us all a lot of time, money and frustration. If you carefully re-read my contract, its bullet-proof. As in iron-clad; cast-iron clad. I�ve been down this road before. These are my projects, which have already been approved by the board, and they are under my total purview. That includes the scope of the project, the people whom I�ve recruited and specifically brought into my teams to make this project ensues. The only way you can get around this is to realize that my staff and I all have exclusive �Take-or-pay� contracts. You alter one jot-or-tittle, we all walk and you are on the hook, by Argentine Labor Law, for repatriation of all Expats as well as the full costs of said contracts, which have to be paid in full before any one of us heads north. Try anything extra-contractual, you�ll be out both the money and the people.��What? We would never agree to��I go to my desk and pull out a signed, sealed and notarized copy of my contract.�Care for a little light reading? Page 36; paragraphs 7 through 35���We�ll see about this!� as he turned and stomped out of my office.Charming fellow. I hope he gets run over by an elevator full of hungry ducks�Days progressed into weeks then into months. The kids came back from Europe and loved their new school. I was a bit concerned, but if the other shoe hadn�t already dropped, it probably wouldn�t at all. I did, however, notice certain little niggling things around the office, which I really couldn�t quite put my remaining fingers on�It was�quieter. Not nearly as frantic as when I moved in. Coffee was getting steadily worse and donuts on Thursday just became extinct. Not all at once, but it was a slowly-rolling expanding ball of micro-events much like a dung beetle builds, this time only corporately.One bleary Monday, I call out to my secretary to ask her to retrieve a file for the drillers I was attempting to recruit.�Ms. Tessmacher�Hello?��Bzzzt...� replied the intercom.I go out to the ante-office and see Ms. Tessmacher is not only not there, but all of her pictures, coffee cups, and personal paraphernalia was gone from her desk.I wander over to my favorite Director�s office and ask if he�s heard anything about our wayward secretary.�Oh, um, yes. Ms. Tessmacher was only an adjunct assigned to you and not part of your �hired� team, so she was let go.��Ah. Well, thanks large for telling me. What am I supposed to do for clerical support?��What clerical support? It told you times are tough and sacrifices have to be made.�OK, gotcha. I see where this is going.�One thing, just the common courtesy of a heads-up if you�re going to pull another stupid stunt like that. Please be so sodding kind as to let me know. If you�d do that, yeah, that�d be just fucking great.��I�m afraid I don�t much care for your attitude���I�m afraid that�s just too fucking bad, Scooter. The board didn�t hire me for my scintillating good looks or my sparkling personality (not by a long shot). They hired me because I�ve been sniffing out and developing giant gas and oilfields for decades all over this planet. You know, that gooey-green glop we put in barrels or VLCCs to exchange for hard currency so we can pay your inflated salary?��I don�t have to stand here and take this���No, you can sit the fuck down, shut up and listen. Take note very carefully: you fuck with my team, however obliquely, or fuck with my support personnel and you won�t be able to fund a Black and Decker hand drill much less the five 3,500 HP top-drive rigs I need for my exploration project. This project is the only exploration project still happening here because I had the foresight to prepare for just such an emergency. You queer this project down the toilet, and you�ve just eaten your seed-corn. My team and I waltz out of here with more money than Croesus and you�ll have nothing to sell. Zip. Zero. Zilch. No reserves, no reserve replacement, no exploration staff, and your bond rating drops like a paralyzed falcon. You diggin� me, Beaumont?�I suppose his turning ashen-white indicated he did receive the message both loudly and clearly.I immediately called Ms. Tessmacher at her home and got her side of the story. She was made redundant for no reason other than to take a jab at me and my team. She was disconsolate. I told her to buck up and I�d ring her back.After calling my kid�s school, I again spoke to Ms. Tessmacher and told her that the school was looking for a native German speaker. Since you were one, had prior teaching experience, and since I had given you an already glowing review, they�d most certainly wish to speak with you.The next job was to call my team together and warn them of Senor Dipshit Director and how my ass was in his gun sights.�Don�t cross this asshole, just point him in my direction. I already physically unnerve him enough to take the starch out of this little prick. He�s just a gasbag with a mission. Ignore him, concentrate on your jobs, and this is all going to work out.�Or so I fervently hoped.There were more redundancies at the company and except for a slide in the quality of catered lunches, my team and I were left more or less alone.But the little, niggling things that just piss a person off continued to happen. Pens and pencils disappeared and were never replaced in the company office-supply closet. Next, field note- and chart books disappeared. Then, PPEs became scarce. That was the camel-breaking straw�off to see Senor Dipshit for a showdown.Knock, slam, knock!�Director Dipshit? We need to talk.��Oh, about what?��Oh, don�t play coy. These little cost-cutting charades of yours are having an adverse effect on my team. Pens and paper are one thing, but Nomex coveralls, safety boots, and hardhats are quite another. You may not think so, but you�re fucking with my team, however circuitously. You�re not from the North, but I am, and I can tell you-you're skating on very thin ice.��I�ve done nothing��Never open with a straight line like that to me.�You�ve done less than nothing. You�re watching the toilet swirl and you are too damned stupid to realize that you�re one of the primary turds that�s about to be slurped.��Are you threatening me?��If speaking the truth is a threat, then make of it as you will. You�ve spent your goofy little corporate life nestled snug and secure in your cute little corner office. You�ve never been out on a rig, ran logs, or pulled core much less weathered a downturn or actually done any real work.�I made sure to prod him lightly in the chest with the keloid-covered remains of my hand.Aghast: �Well, there�s nothing left for me to do.�There was the understatement of the year.He continued: �But, know full well, that you�re spending far too much on international telephone calls.�God damn, you�re a tiringly interfering little fuckhole.�I have to tell you that you must reduce your phone bill by 75%. You have no choice.��75%? Just how the fuck am I supposed to arrange a globally-attended exploratory drilling campaign if I can�t speak with my vendors?��Well, Mr. Oilman���That�s DOCTOR Oilman to you, Scooter.��Well, Doctor Oilman, can just use your infinite store of resources and make the project happen as per your contract.� <shit-eating, wish-I-could-punch-him-in-the-teeth-with-a-2x4, smirk>.Precipitously, a metaphorical light bulb lights off.�Hmmm� As per my contract... OK, fine. That an official order?��Yes. Of course. Now, get out!�I slowly walk out of his office and lightly close the door, letting him think he�s finally got the best of this old Rocknocker.The seed of an idea had been planted. With the application later that night of several healthy draughts of 101-proof Old Thought Provoker, I had a fully germinated plan; all sprouted, grown and set for execution.I spend about a week using my home phone to call many of my old colleagues. I let them know of my plan and that I�m calling in some favors. I asked them to get the word out to their sub-contractors and service companies. I had already ginned up an exhausting itinerary and I�m going to need full cooperation to make this all happen. Luckily, I have a huge number of cohorts, cronies, and comrades collectively in the Oil Patch so the word goes out and my plan slips into high gear.I go to the company�s travel section and hand them my flight requisition. Now, in my contract, there are several shrewd and sneaky codicils that award me more or less carte blanche in times of exploratory emergency. However, I am also allowed to define the term �emergency�, so what I am doing is�legal.Yes, by definition: legal.Moral? Nah.Decent? Nyet.Ethical? Oh, fuck no.But as legal as the right to have egg in your beer.Besides, the fine ladies running the company travel section were all friends of Ms. Tessmacher and word had spread how I had helped her. They also were fearing for their jobs and could not stand Director Dipshit of the Finance Department. They helped me plan my itinerary so I�d leave right at the top of a billing cycle and be back before anyone was much the wiser. I was just taking some time and writing the whole thing off as �Business Expenses�.It was a calculated risk and was going to take some doing to make happen; but since providence provides for fools and drunkards, I was doubly blessed.My plan was to fly from BA to Houston, Houston to OK City, to Calgary, to London, to Stavanger, to Moscow, to Krasnoyarsk, to Vladivostok, to Tokyo, to Beijing, to Hong Kong, to Ho Chi Minh City, to Kuala Lumpur, to Perth, to Bangkok, to Muscat, to Dubai, and back to Buenos Aires.All Business Class, with premium hotels. All in 60 days or less.All for one hell of a lot more than some international phone calls. But, hey, I was just �following orders�.I arrive back in BA, exhausted, with several hundred thousand more frequent flier miles and several billion heavily exercised liver cells. However, Augean as the task had been, it looked like it was going to come together. In fact, several boat and planeloads of drilling kit had already arrived that were being trucked out to location. The travel department was going insane with logistics as company after company showed up, as per plan, and necessary drilling personnel were being bivouacked as per my orders.I went back to the office like nothing had happened and waited for the inevitable.The inevitable happened when Director Dipshit burst into my office, vein-poppingly furious, screaming �Where the hell have you been and what have you done�?�I�m afraid I don�t much care for your attitude�� I calmly replied as I sipped my morning coffee.Apoplectically, he turns this most incredible shade of purple that�s usually not found in nature and screams: �You just spent near $1,950,000 on a junket���Yep. I kept it under two million, just for you���How could you do this?! It�ll be the ruin...��Of your career if this goes south. I was simply following your orders and honoring my contract. I had to talk to my field people and secure their contracts. If I couldn�t call them, well, it was obvious that I�d just have to go visit them in person. You gave me �no other choice�.��You son of a bitch. I�m going to��He really shouldn�t have lit that fuse. I stood up and went toe to toe with this self-important little shit-stain.�You�re going to what? Tell the board you�re a self-important little sawed-off Caesar and were so blinded by your hatred for me and your insane officiousness that you petulantly cut off my phone so I had no other choice than spend a big chunk of the company�s funds on travel and services? Do you really believe that�s going to be a good course of action; particularly since my team leaders and I are going to be sitting in the Peanut Gallery tossing verbal fragmentation grenades and waiting on our flight tickets during your career�s vivisection?��Well, umm���The way I see it is you can ally yourself with my cunning plan and hope like hell it works out. Or you can explain to the board how you�re a bureaucratic little dickhead that just lost the entire Exploration Department. Your call.��You wouldn�t!��Wouldn�t I? You actually stupid enough to be willing to take that chance?��Jesus fuck, you�re a first-class bastard���Count on it. Coming from you, I�m taking that as the highest compliment.�I figured I�d get called into the board meeting later that day, so I made sure to take my wife out for a fine beefy lunch and a couple of bottles of Trapiche Alaris Malbec. If you will pardon me, I have no intention of facing this crowd stone cold.At 1430 hours, I�m summoned before the board. I figured it would be the Argentinian version of the Spanish Inquisition, but the overall mood was rather reserved and quite subdued.�Ah, yes, Doctor Rocknocker. Could you please explain your activities over the last two months, particularly your recent trips and expenses near the two-million dollar mark?�I launched into a Carl Sagan-inspired tale of how extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. I reminded them that in this industry, it takes money to make money and how the faint of heart never fucks the upstairs maid. I noted the race may not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but that is the best way to bet. I told them of my struggle with risk-analysis, weighing the pros and cons of bold, decisive action versus sitting on one�s ass hoping everything turns out for the best. If one is in for a dime, they�re in for a dollar.I laid it on with a trowel backhoe.I recounted how Mr. Finance Director actually spurred me into action (well, that part wasn�t a lie now, was it?) catalyzing the entire project so I simply had no other alternative and was willing to roll the dice and take the chance. It�s how oilmen make decisions in the business. I noted that I thought that this situation absolutely required a really futile and apparently stupid gesture be done on somebody's part, and my exploration team and I were just the guys to do it.Moreover, I recounted the substantial discounts I had secured since the little Oil Patch slowdown wasn�t just affecting Argentina, but the whole world oil industry. I wove a glittering tapestry of the positive press in the interviews I gave to media and our contractors; who were relieved and appreciative to be getting work. Also how the forward-thinking and courageous directors whom I was currently addressing were willing to make difficult decisions and supreme sacrifices to ensure the viability of the company and the oil and gas needs of their country at large.�And I heartily thank you for allowing me to be a part of this outstanding opportunity, ladies and gentlemen of the board.�With that, I strolled back to my seat and took several really deep breaths.I leaned over to my Sr. Geophysicist and whispered: �Think they bought it?�<Exhaling heavily> �I�m going with�yes. Never bullshit a master bullshitter��They conferred a bit and actually thanked me for a clear, concise, and colorful, explanation. They were on-board 100% and pleased how things were working out.�However, Doctor; next time, please do let the board in on your plans before you head out of the country.�The project went forward and I have to admit, we did drill a couple of dusters. Shit, it happens. However, we did discover several trillion cubic meters of condensate rich-gas and a few billion recoverable barrels of nice, light sweet crude. By the time production facilities, pipelines and customers had been lined up, the global slump in oil prices had abated and the company actually stood to make some serious capital. All because of what had been na�vely precipitated by some self-important little prick and his penchant for officiousness.A short time later, Senor Dickweed of Finance decided that the oil industry was no longer really to his liking. I think he�s now working night-tour on a turkey farm somewhere south of Mar del Plata.TL; DR: Off to Argentina this time to do some rank exploration for oil and gas. Had some minor run-ins with an intrusive and meddling company director that forced a Hail Mary play, through his being a shortsighted fuck-nosed little penny-pincher, which had all the earmarks of a world-class disaster. Worked out, but not his way. I like to think that in some small manner, I had hastened Senor Dickweed Director�s early retirement.Edit 1: Did it! Less than 6,000 words. Huzzah and a Tiger for me.Edit 2: Yes, I know it�s still long. No need to remind me.Edit 3. Might just be headed back as their unconventionals are revving up. Great, more clay mineralogy�

When I was younger, idk probably 10/11 I went to the carnival, I was a crack head kid as most are, and I happened to be tall, and skinny. So I�d been waiting for a few years to go on this ride. It was called the ring of fire, or the fireball. Something like that, and all they had was the over the shoulder straps. So I got on and it�s 2 seats facing the other two seats, oh yeah I need to include the fact that the coaster was literally a vertical ring, just a single loop. So we get going and I�m having fun, but the ride stops at the very top of the loop. We stop there and I feel my shoulders start to slip, and I wasn�t strong enough to stop them. My shoulders went all the way through almost to where I had to let go. Just then the guy across from me, probably mid 20�s or younger, reaches over and grabs the top of my head and shoved me back down into the seat, says something along the lines of �there ya go buddy�. I still think about that a lot, a guy saved me life and I almost died.



******************************



I'll preface this story by apologizing for the length, but there's so many details and I'm in desperate need to get this shit off my chest. I'm not sure how to start this, so I'll start from where I began putting the pieces together.My mom was never around. The last memory I have of her was from when I believe I was 3 or 4. I was playing with toys on the living room floor as she just stared at me from the couch. I still remember this because the look she gave me haunts me pretty frequently. My grandmother essentially took her place as a caretaker. My dad was also never around, but he has made a decent attempt at being in my life. He lived with my grandmother and I for a while, but he left soon after moving in to pursue his career (and he's actually gotten pretty far, I'm proud of the guy).Whenever I asked about my mom, I was told unanimously by everyone in my family that she had passed away, to which I never really asked any more questions past that. This went on for years and years, until everything changed in the blink of an eye.I was sitting in one of my classes, about halfway into my junior year of high school. We were all working on scripts for a competition, where the best script selected by the teacher would be put on by the school as a play, of sorts. I didn't really care to win this contest, so I typed out something real quick and submitted it super early. I had nothing else to do, so I sat in the back of the room, dicking around on my phone. Suddenly, a Facebook notification popped up at the top of my screen, saying somebody had sent me a friend request. The picture on the notification didn't look familiar, so I tapped on it so I could pull up the name of the person. That's when shit hit the fan.The girl had my last name, and I remember that I felt my heart just drop. The person who was A) supposedly my mother who I never had a relationship with, and B) was supposedly *dead,* had just friend requested me. My mind was fucking blown. I immediately got up out of the room, and basically ran to the guidance center, calling my grandmother along the way. She told me that, no matter what, I can't talk to her. When I asked her why, she said I couldn't "because of the court." Now, I had even more questions. I finished up with her, and quickly called my dad. He said "the safest thing you can do is to *never contact her, and ignore anything she sends you.*" Holy shit, who is this lady? My dad quickly calmed me down by saying he would explain everything when he came to visit me next fall, and that until then, I should stay quiet. After hanging up the phone, I secretly hoped this whole thing was just an elaborate joke being played on me, but I was very wrong.Ok, so fast-forward to when my dad came to visit. Here's what he told me. My dad met my mom when he was desperate for some sort of housing, as he was kicked out of his mother's house (my grandmother). He eventually found a place, and that's where they started their relationship. This house also had a few other people in it, and apparently they were all *witches* who practiced together in a *coven* (which hilariously explains my interest in Wicca later in life). So they date for a while, and she suddenly gets pregnant with me. According to him, the pregnancy was extremely rocky. He told me about this one time she went completely psycho for some reason and pelted him in the head with a glass bottle at a gas station, and began to throw hands. My dad couldn't fight back because he was scared he would have assault and battery charges against him and would lose me (aw, that was cute). He puts up with this kind of abuse until finally I was born. Weirdly, dad wasn't there for it, as my mother's first call for help was to basically everybody except him. Once I was born, the legal battles instantly started.So this legal shit was barely explained to me, but I'll sum it up as best I can:1. Gram and Dad fought over custody of me. Gram won because she had a better environment for raising a kid (whatever that means).2. A goddamned restraining order against both my mom AND my dad (which I hear was broken SEVERAL TIMES).3. A "court order" which basically meant I was allowed zero contact with her.The restraining order regarding my dad was lifted, which is why we still talk. He's also a really cool guy, so go figure. This wraps up what I learned back then, but this wasn't the end. Oh hell no.So, I turn 20, and I started having more questions. Gram stayed quiet whenever I asked, so my main source of information was my dad. He came up one summer, and he revealed even more info which just... wow.Everyone, on all sides of the family, begged for my mom to abort me. The only person who fought for my life was my dad. He is the literal reason I'm alive at all. My mom had severe bipolar disorder, and she also started showing signs of multi-personality disorder. She would have frequent manic episodes, which were described to me as "pure crazy, son." She would slam her fists into the walls, scream at the top of her lungs, throw things, threaten people... just plain crazy stuff. This wasn't what got to me, however. My mom tried to kill herself. Twice. Both times she carried me down to the basement, placed me on something, and downed an entire fucking bottle of Tylenol. Both times, an entire bottle of the shit. Then, she would call my gram down, place me in her arms, and say, "I just took my pills." Both times, they managed to call an ambulance and have paramedics, doctors, or whatever get all the pills out of her stomach. I can only imagine how crazy that shit was. The part of the story which kills me the most was when she handed me over to gram, she also apparently said, "please take care of him. I can't."And now, she's alive. I haven't asked much about her regarding where she is now, as I have all the info I need by just looking online. The worst thing for me was why did everyone lie to me about her being dead? The answer I got was that it was the easiest to explain to a younger child. Well, I can't say that I don't resent my family for lying to me my entire life. To me, my mom is just a person. Not my mom. This breaks my heart, because I want to believe there's hope for her to get better. My dad says he's open to taking me to visit her, but he claims she will use me to better her own life, while wrecking my own. I go back and forth from considering her my mom to her just being some rando with a really terrible story. Anyways, sorry for such a long story, but this has been eating away at me for so long, and writing things down always makes me feel better. If you read the whole thing, thank you.&#x200B;**TL;DR - my supposedly dead mom friended me on facebook, and my family has a ton of explaining to do.**

One day I had to use the bathroom, and when I say bathroom I Mean had to take a huge shit. So I go to do my Business and all is good. After like 20 minutes of taking this mean ass shit, I realize that there�s no toilet paper.  It�s no big deal usually I�ll just call up my sister and she�ll bring me some. But nobody was home at the time so I still didn�t care I�ll just get up and get some. I find a little bit of  toilet paper on the floor, I proceed too pick up the little bit of toilet and wipe my butt with it, so when I got up no do do feel out of my ass. So I get up, pants down, and and walk downstairs. I go in to my parents room and grab some toilet paper. As I�m grabbing it I hear the door giggle and panic I quickly grab the paper and run, pants still down and I�m not thinking about it. I hear the door start to open and then realize, oh no, my pants are down. They open the door and I�m quickly pulling my pants and underwear up at the same time. And we just looked at each other for a solid 15 seconds of awkward silence. I go hey and just walk upstairs, at this point I didn�t even want to Wipe my butt anymore because it was just so awkward, and I sat there, thinking about how they just walked in and saw me naked for a second and how wired I probably looked coming out of there room like that.Moral of the story, always bring toilet paper to the bathroom

*Wake up. Get dressed. Go to work. Do work. Go home. Go to sleep.* *Wake up. Get dressed. Go to work. Do work. Go home. Go to sleep.**Wake up. Get dressed. Go to work. Do work. Go home. Go to sleep.*Every single day, like clockwork, the same pattern repeated. The tedious tasks of the day only ever shifted slightly, but never enough to make the day stand out from the last. I typed for hours on end. I sipped countless amounts of coffee. I printed so many papers. I did too many spreadsheets. I laughed every day at my bosses shit jokes. And, to be completely honest, I was really fucking tired of it. For once I wanted to do something that mattered. Something, anything that would cut me from this loop of monotony. When would my life become more than just a programme? Like the clock on the far wall, it felt like I was going one direction for the entirety of my existence. That no matter how much I struggled to make every day unique, it always follows the full, clockwise circle that it was programmed to do. I stared harder at the clock, and I swear that it seemed as if it had come to a stand-still. I watched in awe at first, but the awe quickly turned to inspiration.I grabbed a pen from my desk and clicked it open. I got up from behind my desk for the first time in years. Never before had I abandoned my work like this. Never before had I made my own decision about what today would be like. Never before had I felt like this. It was... enlightening.I paced forwards through the maze of office desks and mindless drones. My vision became hazy and my mind began to play tricks on me. The heads of my fellow co-workers morphed into clocks. Ticking and tocking in that same clockwise motion. Or maybe, my mind wasn't playing tricks. Maybe for the first time I could see the truth as clear as day. My boss approached from the opposite end of the hall, a shitty grin plastered on to his face. His stride was pretentious and his arms swayed way more than normal. His hair was gelled and flat, causing a great shine to reflect off his perfect strands. And, to top off his dickhead demeanour, the coffee mug in his hand read 'Best Boss Ever.' What a fucking douche. "Hey, man, how's the work-"I shoved the pen into his eye with as much force as I could muster. His iris exploded in a mess of red and pink, releasing his blood in bursts down my arm and face. I stared at him as I did it, blank-faced and starry-eyed. I was captivated by the raw feeling of it. I pulled out the pen and thrust it hard into his neck. Streams of blood ejected from his throat and smeared my entire face, and I welcomed it. He fell eventually, gasping for air and crying in pain. The screams were like a melody in my ears. I turned back, looking at the clock on the far wall once again. This time, it reversed its course, spinning in an anti-clockwise manner. Same with all the co-workers 'heads'. I smiled.I walked towards the lift and I pressed the button for the ground floor. As the doors closed, a single bead of blood rolled down my forehead and over my eyelid. The red contaminated the whites of my eye, and suddenly, I saw it clearly. No longer were the days which were spent droning about behind a desk, eyes glued to a screen for hours. No longer were the days where I took orders from someone else. No longer were the days spent trapped within an infinite loop for the rest of my days. For the first time in my life, I was free.

I was in my room, listening to a podcast and eating an apple. I finished the apple and threw it away, went back to listening.A bit later I realized an apple seed had fallen out of the core when I�d chucked it into the trash. It was smooth and dark brown and pointy, so in it went.An hour later, I�m eating dinner alone in the house in the dark. I need to go to the bathroom. As I sit down on the toilet I felt something poking in my belly button.�Huh,� I thought, and reached in. I pulled it out- hello again good sir.

Two men, both seriously ill, occupied the same hospital room.One man was allowed to sit up in his bed for anhour each afternoon to help drain the fluid from his lungs.His bed was next to the room's only window.The other man had to spend all his time flat on his back.The men talked for hours on end.They spoke of their wives and families, their homes, their jobs, their involvement in the military service, where they had been onvacation..Every afternoon, when the man in the bed by the window could sit up, he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside the window.The man in the other bed began to live for those one hour periods where his world would be broadened and enlivened by all the activity and color of the world outside.The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake.Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Young lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every colourand a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in the distance.As the man by the window described all this in exquisite details, the man on the other side of the room would close his eyes and imagine this picturesque scene.One warm afternoon, the man by the window described a parade passing by.Although the other man could not hear the band - he could see it in his mind's eye as the gentleman by the window portrayed it withdescriptive words.Days, weeks and months passed.One morning, the day nurse arrived to bring water for their baths only to find the lifeless body of the man by the window, who had died peacefully in his sleep.She was saddened and called the hospitalattendants to take the body away.As soon as it seemed appropriate, the other man asked if he could be moved next to the window.The nurse was happy to make the switch, and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone.Slowly, painfully, he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the real world outside.He strained to slowly turn to look out the window besides the bed.It faced a blank wall.The man asked the nurse what could have compelled his deceased roommate who had described such wonderful things outside thiswindow.The nurse responded that the man was blind and could not even see the wall.She said, 'Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you.'Epilogue:There is tremendous happiness in making others happy, despite our own situations.Shared grief is half the sorrow, but happiness when shared, is doubled.If you want to feel rich, just count all the things you have that money can't buy.'Today is a gift, that is why it is called The Present .'The origin of this letter is unknown.

(EDIT: Thanks for the silver award!) Just to clarify I have absolutely no memory of this event occurring but my mum swears it's true and I have zero reason not to believe her. I was I think around 7 at the time (As of now I'm 18) and my Great Grandad had passed away, truth be told I wasn't ever really that close to him from what I can remember, mostly due to how shy I was.And a period of time passes, probably no longer then a month and my mum is downstairs in the morning doing whatever it is she would have been doing when I say."Grandad Spike visited me last night."Obviously she's caught off guard and assumes I had been dreaming but asks me what happened anyway, I tell her."He says that Heaven is really nice but he's a little bit upset because he doesn't have his glasses." (Its worth mentioning that me and my parents aren't religious. We don't pray or go to church or anything.)So my mum is still just shrugging this off as a dream I had, but after a few days she goes and pays Great Nana Mary a visit (Grandad Spikes wife) and just casually brings up everything I tell her, expecting her to find it comforting to know I had dreamt about him.My mum was not expecting to find out that Nana had forgotten to put his glasses in his coffin when he was buried and was embarrassed about it and never told anyone.How I managed to come across said information is beyond me but if it's a coincidence then it's definitely a wild one.

I was around 5 or 6 years old, and my sister was maybe 7 or 8. My mom was dating some guy named Paul. I don�t remember exactly how long they were dating, but it really feels like they were dating for at most, a few weeks.So Paul had a small 1 bedroom apartment, and it was right next door to where my mom and Paul worked. It was the same building, just two doors down. If I remember correctly, my mom was a telemarketer and that�s how she met Paul.So one night, we spent the night at Paul�s apartment, and the next morning, my mom and Paul went to work and left my sister and I alone. It may seem crazy now to leave a 7 year old in charge of a 5 year old, but it was the 90s, and they were seriously right next door. While my sister and I were watching TV, someone knocks on the door and we answer. A couple of big white dudes were out there, and they asked if Paul was home. Naturally, we answered �he�s at work next door� and pointed to the door. So one of the dudes was like �well, Paul told us to come over so we can get our things� and we were like �oh, ok. Come on in�. So the two dudes standing there wave at a third dude, and they all come in and start taking Paul�s things. They took his bed, his TV, his couch, his small dinning room table, the refrigerator, the microwave, the dishes, they took EVERYTHING. Paul had a lizard in an aquarium, and while they were taking the lizard, some how it jumped out and went and hid in the cabinets. These dudes were really nice to us, and making jokes with us, being friendly. Paul�s apartment was small, so it took them less than 30 mins or so to load up all his stuff in their truck.They didn�t want us sitting on the floor, so they left 1 cheap wooden rocking chair in the house. They couldn�t catch the lizard, so that stayed too. They took EVERYTHING else though. They took the dresser with all of Paul�s clothes still in the drawers. They even took his dirty clothes basket. EVERYTHING.So they leave and tell us to lock up. It must have been my mom and Paul�s lunch time, and they come walking in. Paul sees his empty apartment and asked �what the fuck. Where the fuck is my shit� to which my sister proudly answered �oh, your friends came to pick it all up for you�.My mom starts to giggle a little bit, but Paul is almost in tears. He was yelling and telling us we should have came and got him. At one point, I asked �are you mad at your friends� and he said �those weren�t my god damn friends�. I�m pretty sure he broke up with my mom with in an hour, because I don�t remember ever seeing paul again. So, that�s the story of the time my sister and I have permission to some henchmen to rob my moms boyfriend.

So this is a story about a time that I was being dumb... aka a few hours ago. So almost a week ago, I made myself some hot cocoa. It was really good because I added a peppermint and some marshmallows. Anyways I�m never able to finish hot cocoa and apparently I forgot about it and stayed overnight at my dads job.Fast forward to yesterday. I�m laying in bed with my dogs before dinner and I smell something strange. I knew I had smelled it somewhere else but I couldn�t remember where or what it was coming from. All I could think was cheese. I managed to go to sleep that night because I couldn�t identify the smell.Tonight I was laying in bed trying to go sleep but I kept smelling the smell. I would put lotion on the back of my hand to block out the scent until morning so I could look for the source again. Then I remembered that I didn�t do my homework so I got up and started it. Finally I got back in bed and smelled it again. It was soooo bad. I checked my pillow, my dog, my sheets, my clothes, everything I could think of. When I didn�t find anything I decided to keep looking the next day. While I was trying to fall asleep I looked over onto my nightstand and saw the mug I had made the hot cocoa in. That�s when I realized �Oh heyy... I put milk in that.� So I got back up to smell it and it was horrible. That�s why I smelled cheese... I took it to the sink and put hot water in it so I could clean it. The smells gone now.

When I was 9, I went to Disney world for a Christmas gift and lived out every American kid�s dream. Well, except one part of the trip wasn�t very dreamy...So, I was in a theater watching a behind-the-scenes movie about- Star Wars, I think? Anyways, there was this one Spanish-speaking lady behind me (I was in one of the very back rows) who was driving me nuts. She wouldn�t stop talking loudly every second of the movie. I turned around to shush her, but she just kept talking without even pausing! I shushed her three more times, not even paying attention to the movie anymore. Eventually, I said �SHUT UP!� But she just kept rambling on. I just decided to ignore her.It wasn�t until I started to exit the theater that I caught sight of the talking lady. Her outfit looked like a uniform and read �Int�rprete/Interpreter� Thats when I realized the ugly truth: I had just told a Spanish interpreter to shut up

I was in English class and I suddenly had the urge to fart but didn�t know how to pull it off without anyone noticing. Later I had the bright idea to drop my binder on the floor and when it hits the floor I fart so nobody would hear it. I decide to go for it and I drop my binder. Little did I know the binder hit my chair while falling which delayed the fall so basically what happened was that My binder hit the ground and called attention to me, and then one second later I just let out a massive fart.(Not my experience)

I went to the liquor store the other day and someone had questions about whiskey being the only alcohol I ever drink I decided to help(knowing that the owners or the employees did not drink whiskey) and the employees got soo mad at me(but the owner was grateful I mean I got her a sale) but the employee was so mad she made a snobby comment �what is he a whiskey connoisseur� like no bitch I�m an alcoholic mind your damn business

So, my Language arts teacher always has a song playing when everyone walks into class. Just a few days ago, the teacher decided to open up a opitonal assigment where we could submit any clean song suggestions where he could play next time. Of course, there were many people that suggested stuff like Peppa pig, sponge Bob, let It Go, and other stuff like that, but I did not expect someone to actually rickroll him.

I've been depressed and suicidal ever since I can remember. It's genetic, runs in the family. Dad's side of the family has suicide victims, as does my mom, so I got hit with both barrels. There was never a period in my life where my depression and anxiety didn't make me feel like shit. When I joined kindergarten I remember hiding in the corner from the other kids, throwing up while reading books because I had no idea how to interact with the class. Kids bullied me for only having one testicle, they bullied me for being a little weird, they bullied me for everything. I was sad and alone, felt like a loser and wanted to just leave, and death seemed like the best way to do it. The main reason I'm still alive is because of my mom. My mom has always been there for me, when I would cry she would stroke my hair and hold me, when I felt alone she would come in and just talk- not in a patronizing tone but rather like I was an adult. My mom was and is my best friend. She would always sing "you are my sunshine" to me to remind me that I'm always loved and cared for. &#x200B;I'm 23 now and I think about those little moments all the time. They're the only reason I'm still breathing. My mom is my rock and anchor and I don't know what I will do without her. She had to go to the doctor the other day for memory issues. She has always had impeccable memory, but just like depression Alzheimer runs in my family. The past few months she's been leaving her keys weird places, forgetting why she entered a room and leaving pots boiling with nothing in them. The other day she called me crying saying she didn't know where she was or how she got there. She had walked through the woods down the bank of our property barefoot, her feet cut and bruised and bleeding. She went to the doctor just this week and got the news- early onset Alzheimer. My mom is going to lose herself one day, and when she does I know what I will do. I read on Reddit that songs can trigger memories, and with my mom "you are my sunshine" is the song she associates with me and her childhood. All I can think about right now is the day that I'm going to have to hold her in my arms, the way she held me in hers when I was scared of the world. I'll stroke her hair the way she would mine when I felt alone, and I'll take care of her how she did me. &#x200B;The thing that's fucking with me are the word's to "you are my sunshine" and knowing I will have to sing them to mom when she begins losing herself- I don't think I can cope. I mean fuck, just read these few lines: The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping  I dreamed I held you in my arms  But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken  And I hung my head and I criedYou are my sunshine, my only sunshine  You make me happy when skies are grey  You'll never know, dear, how much I love you  Please don't take my sunshine awayShe may come to one day where she doesn't know how much I love her, or how much she loved me. As a child sleeping with mom made me feel safe and loved when  I couldn't love myself. Knowing one day I'm going to wake and never feel that same hug again kills me. This entire song was some fucked joke at my expense, as it was the thing that symbolized my moms love for me, and also that she will one day forget me and become the same scared sad kid I was. I will always be there for my mom, I will hold her and sing her this song until the end, even if it kills me to just think about. &#x200B;Thanks for reading, I have no one else to talk to about this, my throat hurts from how hard I've been holding back tears the past few days. I love my mom and I just wanted someone to know that even if she forgets me, I will never forget her. &#x200B;You are my sunshine, and I hope you know how much I love you. Thanks mom.

So I�m doing VCE History at the moment and we had to do a project on an extermination camp in Nazi Germany.I�m doing this project at home and I get a little horny and decided to go on PornHub. I get on to a really good video and start jerking off.This is when it goes bad.My father walks in and I quickly switch desktops to the project. However the website was the Aushwitz Wikipedia page. I also still have my right hand on my penis.My poor father sees everything.I try to explain to him that I wasn�t jerking off to Aushwitz and the 3 million Jews killed there and that I was just watching regular porn, but it was no use.It doesn�t end well for me, my father tells my mother and I now have to see a counsellor. I�m sorry if this doesn�t belong here but it�s just a really funny story and my counsellor understands and even takes me to the bar when I have to see him. I�m 18 and in year 12 so it�s ok.

That reminds me of a story.I was working as a relatively green Operations Geologist on a Vicksburg rig down in South Texas a few decades back. Wandered out of the doghouse one early evening to see the floor hands pacing nervously around the rotary table, wondering why they had stopped POOH (pulling out of hole) as we were doing a bit trip (well was a deep'un: some 15,500' TD at the time). The Driller and Pusher are anxiously staring at the Martin-Decker (WOB: weight on bit) gauge watching it swing like an England pendulum-do. The whole rig is vibrating, shaking more than usual with 8-cylinder mud pumps that are running flat out and the diesels moaning their woeful one-note song. I mosey over to the Driller: "What's up, Merle? Problem?""Taking a fucking kick, you big dumbass". Drillers are nothing if not polite and well-mannered. Merle continues: "Ever been on a kick before?  No? Fuck. Good thing it's not a sour well, like I got time to deal with your sorry..."He never quite finished that line of thought as suddenly the rig shuddered like it just took a direct hit from Thor's big-ass hammer. With that, the floor crew to a man, bailed off the rig floor as if a truck announcing "Free Beer, Pussy, and Cigarettes" just rolled on location. Even the Pusher sidled off the rig floor, claiming he had to check the "BOPs" or some other sort of bullshit. The shit, was evidently, hurtling speedily towards the fan. Drilling mud starts burbling (like a dyspeptic geyser) out of the borehole and spraying around the rig like a meth-addled skunk. Very untidy. OSHA certainly would not approve.  The Driller grabs me and drags me over to a console with which I'm not familiar. I mean, I had a pretty good grasp on all the other greasy, nasty, heavy, dangerous, sharp, deadly items on a rig; but hey, there's a first time for everything. He flips open the BOP console (I gathered he wasn't bullshitting this time) hits a couple of test buttons and everything's green. He actuates the "pipe rams", which hydraulically close packers (elastomeric seals) around the pipe, ostensibly to seal (shut-in) the well. Well, at least that's the theory. Mud, gas, water, and sand are spewing out of the well at what sounded like supersonic speeds. It was loud; loud like standing directly behind a 747-400 at takeoff-loud.  I could barely hear the gentle guttural grumbles of the Driller: "Fuck, fuck, double fuck, fuck, FUCK!"Then the pipe, which was being just previously pulled out of the hole in nice neat tribbles (3-30' sections, unscrewed and stacked on the rig floor) decided it wanted to join the fun and began to slowly inch and centimeter their way north. In short, the rams weren't holding and we had a "situation" on our hands. No well integrity, losing mud at the rate of knots, and drill pipe snaking out the hole at a disconcertingly rapidly increasing rate. No options left, the shear rams were thrown. These are basically very tough hardened-steel v-blocks, actuated by many, many thousands of pounds of instantly applied hydraulic horsepower. These will shear through the drill pipe, cut it clean off and shut the well in with a massive metal-to-metal seal. So there.All well and good, but shear rams do have their limits: they can cut through 3.5" drill string like you biting off a hunk of particularly piquant persimmon. However, they don't do so well when they are fired off as a pipe connection ("pin and box": where 2 pieces of drill pipe mate) comes cruising through the BOPs. The shears actually snapped when they hit the connection, but they held the drill pipe in place, at least for a time. The well was�well�well and truly out of control; spewing noxious fluids all over the landscape. Also, let's not forget what was powering this whole show: nicely noxious, overtly overpressured and very, very volatile natural gas. Natural gas and sand. Natural gas and sand shooting skyward at somewhere around Mach-3 at roughly 4,000 to 5,000 pounds per square inch pressure. With this wonderful concoction, you've gone from orderly gas well to mega-industrial sandblaster.  Quartz sand, being rather sharp and abrasive, cuts rig-iron like warm manicotti and tends to *spark* from time to time...The Driller looks at me and flatly asks: "How fast can you run?" He hits the "Holy Fuck!� klaxon (warning to everyone around that the excrement *has* impacted the rotary air-moving device) and we're off like its last call at the Dew Drop Inn.Vaulting over the V-doors, sliding down the pipe ramp, we bob and weave through the pipe racks and flat-out haul-ass into the cotton field that the company was going to soon be in need of purchasing. We get to about 400 or so meters off location (where sit company cars, company man's trailer, workers trailers, a logging truck, and a few millions of dollars� worth of drilling equipment and supplies) when there's this Gawd-almighty "**FAGROON**!", and we're instantaneously thrown back then sucked forward as the gas blasting out of the well ignites. It hits us with a massive detonation shockwave one second, then it drags us forward as the lustily combusting well fire begins to consume the local atmosphere like Todd and Karen Sixpack scarfing crab legs at a Las Vegas buffet. Summary:One Jacobs Brothers Drilling Rig: total loss.One 15,500� wellbore: total loss.6 cars, 1 logging truck, 1 motorcycle: total loss. 2 rig dogs: status unknown, last seen deadheading for Saskatchewan.4 workman�s trailers: total loss.1 pair geologists' boxer-briefs: total loss.

       My world changed for the craziest adventure I�d ever face in one night! It was a lazy day essentially but I had to be productive. Same stuff as always, come home, clean the house, make dinner, and do homework. It was only a matter of time before my dad came home. One wrong thing in the apartment and the world collapses. Cleaning up all beer bottles, cans, and boxes took a lot of time out of my free time but it had to happen. Heck, I was used to it by now and it was plan A. Finished up the chores and knocked out my homework. Dinner on the other hand had to wait due to the time I had left. I�ve been saving some money for situations like this so I had all the bases covered. 11pm finally came around and my dad is outside talking to his friend loudly so I knew he had been drinking again so I had to prepare plan B. I opened my bedroom window and removed the screen. Don�t want my dad to chase me down the street with a pole again, that was terrifying. He unlocked the front door and stumbled over to the couch. He screamed out my name and went out to the living room. My dad turned to me and asked to turn on the TV and put the movie he rented in the VCR. Can�t remember what movie it was but I didn�t care for it so I went back to my room. I checked to make sure that my window was open because anything can happen. My dad called out again so I went out to the living room, he wanted me to grab some beers from the fridge. As I was grabbing them I felt scared as I always did. He became a monster when he came home drunk and continued to drink. It�s the whole reason Plan B existed. I placed a few 40�s on the table, he opened one up and slammed it down, and tossed the bottle on the floor. Luckily we had thick carpeting so I didn�t break. I went back to my room to play some video games. I heard another bottle get tossed in the living room, this time against the wall. I peeked out my bedroom door to just to see what happened and make sure to be aware of what�s going to happen next. An hour passed or so and I heard the third bottle slammed on the table. I peeked out of my bedroom door again, he started to raise his voice slightly and get upset at something. That something might be me, but I was never sure. He started to get up staggering a bit, walked over and shut off the tv. It was time to prepare for plan B. I quickly turned off my TV and console. My dad bursted into my room reaching out and grabbed me by my jacket, I quickly unzipped it and slipped out of it. I quickly leaped out of my window and made a break for it. I made it to a hiding place down the street that I used frequently. I knew I had to wait for him to pass out from drinking before I returned home. After about a half hour or so I left my hiding spot to go get some food from the Jack in the box down the street. I would just knock on the drive through window and they were nice about me ordering food. After I got my food I would make my way to a friends house, luckily he was home and he already understood the situation because we�ve been here before. So my friend and myself headed towards the beach.       It was peaceful, the sounds of the waves and hanging out. I went over to a payphone and called the operator to find out the time. It was roughly 2:30 am so I figured it was a reasonable time to head home. My friend and I headed back to my apartment and I noticed my dad was possibly still awake. I asked my friend to knock on the door to check while I was getting ready to book it again. Once the front door unlocked I took off back to my hiding spot again, about 20 minutes later my friend came to my hiding place and made sure I was there. He told me that my dad is planning to move and he wanted me to come home so we can pack. My dad was a massive traveler and we have traveled a lot, so this was believable to me. I didn�t want to go with him this time though, I hoped he left without me. About another half hour passed and I checked back home. I noticed the lights were off and front door locked, I checked my bedroom window and it was still unlocked so I headed in and noticed my dad and his duffel bag were gone. This was a sigh of relief but I had to make sure. We decided to leave the apartment and head the bus station, it was a few blocks away. I snook around the bus station and saw my dad there with his duffel bag and a friend waiting for the bus. We decided to head back to the apartment and hang out for a while and play some video games.      Some time had passed playing Mortal Kombat, just as I was about to pop in Super Mario World I heard the front gate to the apartment open up, I freaked out and started shutting off everything and we ran into my closet and shut the door. The front door opened and I knew it was him and his friend. They knew we were home because the door was locked when they left. My room door opened and light  was turned on. My dad yelling my name right outside my room. I was scared and told my friend to not make a sound. I could hear my dad and his friend scattering around the apartment looking for me. His friend came to my closet and opened the door. I tried to push him away so I could make a break for my window but he grabbed me and picked me up. He covered my mouth when I tried to scream. My friend freaked out and tried to get him to let me go but my dad came in the room and pushed him aside and told his friend to put me in the chair in the living room. He held me there as my dad started to tie me down to the chair. I pleaded and cried out for anyone as my friend watched. My dad turned to my friend and told him to leave, I begged him to stay because I was terrified. My dad grabbed my friend and pushed him out of the apartment and locked the door. My dad started asking me questions, like why do I deserve to live? I�m just something that�s getting in the way. He walked in the next room and came back with a crossbow. Pulled it back and pointed the unloaded crossbow at me and said he could end me just like that, as he pulled the trigger.  I felt the wind off the string flinging forward off my wet face from the tears I was pouring out. He pulled back on the string a second time, this time he opened his duffel bag and grabs a bolt from it and asks me if I knew what it was. I just sat there crying looking down at the floor. My dad fired another unloaded shot at me again. He started to pull the string back a third time, but there was a knock on the door. My dads friend looks through the peep hole and says it�s the police, I started screaming for help and the cops started kicking on the metal door. My dad quickly ran out the room, my dads friend untied me and I got up as fast as I can to unlock the door and tried to open it but my dads friend pushed me away from the door. The police kicked the door in and flooded the apartment. They tackled my dad and his friend to the ground to handcuff them. They pulled me out of the apartment and took me to safety. An officer started to ask me what happened but I had to gather my thoughts for a brief moment and calm myself down. I explained everything to the officer and they started to ask my dad and his friend questions. After about an hour, the officer I talked to came up to me and said, they can�t find any evidence of a crossbow or anything along those lines and my dad is just drunk and will sober up by tomorrow so I�m safe to go back and get some rest. I started to freak out and told the officer if there�s any other options, I can�t go back through that again. He told me that it will be ok, but I know it won�t. I told him to put me in foster care, he asked if I knew what that was and I did. It had to better than my current life. The officer took me to his car and told me to stay there for moment and went over to talk to my dad. I saw my friend come around the corner, he told me he went to the payphone and called the cops. I thanked him beyond anything in the world and he saved my life that night. The officer came back over to me and wanted to make sure that I wanted to go into foster care. I said yes and he opened the police car door and sat me in it. I said goodbye to my friend and told him thanks again and again. The cop that drove me down to the station, told me that was going to be placed in a temporary placement home, and we will be there in about an hour. I started to smile and shed tears of joy, I didn�t have to get beat anymore, I didn�t have to get hurt anymore, and most of all I was free from the monster my dad was. I was 9 years old.........I know it�s a lot to read but I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this.Edit: For those who enjoyed this little bit of my life, I�m really cool with sharing more of my adventure into fosterhood as well, I enjoy telling my story even though it�s a rough one I still have an amazing positive attitude. Thanks for the support guys it�s been rough life but I continue this day to  improve and bettering myself. And let me know if you guys would like to hear more!� maybe make this a chapter thing or something.

Back in the time 11 years ago . I was so interested in making vedio games using untiity . But family and friends was destroying my dreams to become a great vedio game maker . So i left making vedio games and i don't realy want to make games anymore . Yesterday i was too bored . So i opened my old drive account and re-toke all backups . And when i was surfing it . I found my old creations folder . It included lots of shitty games with insane bugs . But one of the games called "Night Of Raids I"  was so funny to play . Even that it was very simple and low-graphics and reptitive . I found my self  still palying after 2.5 hours , And i didn't fell the time  I wanted to keep playing but my battery  was 11% .Today i wake up like 4 hours earlier than usuall . And all i was thinking is when i will leave bed and play the game . I tried to sleep again but I can't and I was feeling that the time is walking very slowly .I gave up 2 minutes later and went to play the game . And I just ended up playing it and felt so relaxed  and hungry to play more .I wanted to share my story with some people . And i found reddit as a good platform

This morning went as usual. I made breakfast for me and my friend while my husband got ready for work. My friend is looking for a new place to live and is staying on our couch until she finds one. She�s been here a week, but was home sick for the past two days.We all share a pair of double sinks outside our bathroom. We keep it neat, and the counter is clutter free, aside from some decor and a few toiletries. It wasn�t until a few hours after us getting ready that my husband first noticed it. [The tooth.](https://ibb.co/mTy830f)It was just sitting there. Staring at him.Then the investigation began. He was inspecting both our mouths, we looked at the dogs, only to confirm that we all had a healthy full set of teeth. Then the accusations started. �Did you start a fight club in our hallway?��Are you getting gummers from meth heads?��Are YOU the tooth fairy?��Where is the rest of the body?��Did a kid from school hide teeth in your clothes?� This one was serious, because I teach middle school and tutor elementary kids. However, I realized that this isn�t the first time I was accused of a leaving a tooth in a bathroom.Cut to ten years ago. My best friend offered for me to house sit. She gave me permission to have my boyfriend and my dog to stay.  His best friend stopped by a couple times to have a beer, but he stayed for a couple hours and never left the living room.  Before she and her boyfriend returned, I cleaned the whole house, did her laundry, and organized his paperwork. She was grateful to come back to a clean home, the four of us had a couple beers, and I left. Then she called me, almost angry.�So I was wondering, why is a fucking tooth on my bathroom rug?�Of course I asked both the boys and although they looked a little scrubby, they both had perfect teeth.  I swore to her I had no idea where it came from, and she insisted it had to come from me.This tooth ruined my friendship. She would bring it up every time we hung out since. Mutual friends started to bring it up to me, to the point that I stopped hanging out with them.Now here I am, ten years later, and there is a fucking tooth in my bathroom.I think that bitch cursed me.

That reminds me of a story�.Back yet again with another tale from the Late Paleocene, (when I was but a wee lad of 1.97 meters and 22 stone; i.e., sometime late last week�).Well, it seems that I was enrolled in one or another campus� of the University of Wisconsin where it was demonstrated that someone of my ilk, you know: white, male, high school graduate, good grades, from a firmly Anglo-Saxon extraction; was yielded absolutely zero in the form of �Student Assistance�; i.e., cash to go to school.In other words: if I wanted to go to University, I had to get a job.Well.That sucks.Especially in the late 70�s.Damn.I could have relocated to Canada.But, I hate maple candy and Moosehead.Besides, it was 4 hours north.Anyways.Being the sort of type that was continually listed as �off the chart� when it comes to insurance charts, I had very little choice in my preferred vocations. Or, more to the point, there were precious few jobs available in those late 70�s they didn�t include tightening the same lug-nuts for 18 hours a day or bouncing drunks out of the local grogshop.That I possessed a certain amount of grey matter that precluded the former and a tiny amount of self-respect to deny the latter.Then, there came the advert in the local daily:�Wanted: Slaughter-hands�.Slaughter-hands?�Slaughter-hands?�Well, this could be interesting.So, bright and early, sometime around 11 o�clock, I show up for the obligatory interview scrum. There were fully 400 people queuing up for exactly 3 jobs.Yeah.I know.You�re thinking: �Sure, he gets a job.�Yeah, hey.I actually DO get a job.Given my size, situation, and state of affairs (i.e., poor, studently, and willing to do just about anything (but�just about) for a buck)); I was offered a job in the local slaughterhouse as a �loafer�.�Loafer�?Getting paid for doing what I usually do in front of the TV?Ummm�Not quite.�Loafing� was basically doing just about any sort of shit job anyone else in the slaughterhouse didn�t want to do. Low-man-on-the-totem-pole sort of stuff.And I was to be a loafer.Can�t really complain, though. I�d put up with a lot of shit for $22.50 an hour.�Where�s your Union Card?�Union card? What Union Card?��Union dues are US$195. Due immediately.��$195?� (�Oh, Holy Fuck...the crowds are going restless��)�Jenkins G. Christ. Can I pay you after I get my first check?��Nope. Due right now. Pay up or you can�t be in the union, and if you�re not in the union, you don�t get paid��Catch-22.I reiterate: �This sucks.�I, therefore, suck up a weekend complete without whiskey, decent beer, & red, red wine; and a month-full of Spam, potted-meat-food product, Walter�s Bock and chicken pot pies; I pony up the $195.Ouch.That hurt.But, then again, I am gainfully employed.My first shift consists of carrying portions of freshly-killed cow carcasses (about 150-200 kg; so don�t even think about fucking around with me) from the killing floor to the refrigerated trucks; all curiously bearing the �Monfort Beef� logo.And then, it gets better.Southern Wisconsin.Just north of Chicago.Utterly (no pun intended) rural.Pastoral. Bucolic. Countrified.No one knows what�s really going on.Ummm�Never mind. Forget I ever mentioned Jimmy Hoffa. No, really.Back to our story�There were thousands of beef critters per day (we operated 24/7); led up the chutes, to a rather ignominious conclusion. These were destined, after a certain amount of flagrancy, to emerge as your Big Macs, Quarter Pounders (�Big Royals� in other parlances) and �Beef-n-Bacon� burgers in your local fast-foodery.But, herein lies a tale: once a beef critter is selected to attend a short course at the local abattoir, it leads almost a charmed life. Sure it gets whacked and tracked, but it is done with the utmost delicacy. There are Jewish Rabbis making sure everything is Kosher (quite literally). There are certain Christian sects (most notably: PETA; which, to me, are most notably un-Christian, but, then again, I am an unrepentant atheist) wanting to ensure the cattle�s last minutes are most comfy (but how reciting Gospel at them achieves this is well beyond human ken) and Imams of the Muslim persuasion (assuring the beeves are croaked halal, and the swine haram; I beam a bit proud to recollect that this is 1979, by the way, and in the heart of the good ol� Midwest US of A), who insist on maintaining that certain methodologies are adhered to and that everything is done according to their mythology.Me? I was just in it for the money (funny how things never change�).Besides, there were worse jobs than lugging ponderous sides of beef around. I could have been made a �shithook� (one who cleans up on the kill floor, seems that cows tend to get rather loose bowels after they�re �treated�). Or a �gut-buncher�, whose job it was to gather up the entrails after the primary butcher splits the fresh carcass, and sends saleable by-products (intestines, tongues, brains, etc.) down various �slurpholes�; although why anyone would want a cow�s stomach is well beyond me.So, it came that there was once this Friday that three individuals (not to be later referred to in the narrative as �The Three Stooges� (way too easy, and too derivative), the �Three Un-wise men� and/or �Those fucking idiots�)), curtailed their non-Worpolian activities, sallied forth, and infiltrated our place of purveyance, to try and negotiate the vendage of some of our less less-than-cheesy-comestibles.With appropriate apologies to Michael Palin and John Cleese.In other words, they tried to �purchase� some sausages.�Shop�s over that way�, related Bruno (another co-mutant from the planet Huge), pointing to the west.�This is the slaughterhouse, you don�t want to be here���Oh. Sorry. Ok, �eh.�And they abruptly left.Or so it was thought.Or so they thought.Anyways, back to work: I was manning the bolt gun. (Aside: for the uninitiated, the �bolt gun� kills the animal and renders it instantly unconscious without causing pain. A �captive bolt gun� (the variety employed where I was employed) has a steel bolt that is powered by either compressed air or a blank .32 caliber cartridge. The bolt is driven into the animal's brain. It has the same effect on the animal as a firearm with a live bullet. After the animal is shot the bolt retracts and is reset for the next animal. A captive bolt gun is safer than a firearm. Just thought you might want to know�)Hey.It was my turn.�Phff...thump.�It wasn�t terribly pretty, but at least I was promoted off the slop floor...�Phff...thump.��Phff...thump.�Looking up, I see three bewildered looking cretins, going slowly from glowering redneck to a rather unusually docile greenish-hue.�Who the hell are you?� I inquired.�Phff...thump.��Ummm�erf��<long hard �get-back-down-there, breakfast� look> �we want some sausages.��Phff...thump.��Man, you guys are really lost. The shop�s over here...this is the killfloor.��Phff...thump.�[Goggle�heave...retch] �Oh, man. Stop that.��Phff...thump.��What?��Phff...thump.��Jesus Christ. Stop that!��Phff...thump.��Jesus Christ. Stop what?��That. That�s disgusting!��Yeah. So? It�s my job.��Phff...thump.�<ever rising gorge�>�Bathroom�s over that way���Phff...mooooo�..� �Hmmm�needs a second shot�, �Phff...thump.� �Ah, that�s better�.Gaak. Argh. Retch.Suddenly in a creditable impression of the 1936 version of Jesse Owens; they, as one, sprint for the exit.�Phff...thump.��Idiots.�Some people.�Phff...thump.�Just another day at work.After a few hours of all this, I decided that it�s �break time� and head, surprisingly enough, to the �break room�, to have, well, �breakfast� (working 3rd shift does have certain disadvantages). I am joined by 5 or 9 other unfortunates working the graveyard shift, and as we sit around drinking our coffee and smoking our smokeables, the talk turned, as is inevitable, to �Shop Talk�.�Damn�, sighs Tony, one of our master carvers, �I sure do get tired of all the traffic on the floor.�A chorus of �Yeahs� and �Fuckin-A�s� percolate through the break room like our late night java fix.�During the daytime, it�s actually worse�, complains Randy, another master carver; �We get school kids who come out to the place thinking they�re going to see Farmer Brown and Bossie, but they get the film (circa 1950 �Troy McClure�-type stuff like �Beef Cattle and You!�). Then a demonstration of how sausage and shit�s made and then a walk through the shop� (meaning the factory where I worked and living cattle were transmogrified into Big Mac ingredients). �Probably gives�em nightmares for weeks.�, he chuckled.�Or maybe, they get an appreciation of just how steaks don�t grow out in the fields, but there�s some real work involved to fill the meat department�s freezers at the Pig. (i.e., Piggly Wiggly, the local grocery chain).�Well, Ya�sure. Maybe. But it�s still funny as shit when they walk up and see how the bolt gun works!�, chides Bruno.�Yeah, hey. Like these 3 schmucks that were here just a few hours ago�, I reply. ��Looking for sausage on the killfloor.� Total retards.��Yeah, who were those turds?�, asks Louie, �They seemed, I dunno, sorta hinky, even for goobs on a tour.��No idea�, I replied, �But Bruno�s right, they did turn the most incredible shade of green when they saw what I was up to��Indecipherable mutterings and ass-scratching followed as it was realized that it was time to get back to work.It all settles into an almost hypnotic milieu of cattle in, bolt gun, carcass hang, (etc., etc., etc�.I�ll spare you the detailed play-by-play).Oh, did I mention that a slaughterhouse is one hot, humid place to work, even in winter? Well it is and I suppose I should because that�s an integral part of the story, and it was sort of wintery.It was hot and humid on the floor (see?), so we usually prop open a door or two (not fully open, just a few inches) to let the steam, noise and cattle farts out and some desperately needed fresh breeze in.But what breezed in next was neither fresh not particularly needed.The back door burst open and then�The three morons broke free.�Mothers up, hand fuckers!��What?��I mean: �Hands up, motherfuckers.��Well, that got our attention.You have got to be kidding. <�Head in hands division.�>There they were, the �Three Ignorami�, (for the lack of a better name), brandishing their weapons: one with a 12 gauge goose gun, one with a hunting rifle of one form or another and one brandishing a knife last seen in a Rambo movie, obviously recently liberated from the Home Shopping Network.�I know payroll�s kept here for tomorrow. Gimme the dough!�, bawls the lead ignoramus.Indeed, tomorrow was payday, and many, many of my cohorts were paid in cash.Now, as a quick digression so one may reclaim their breath after all this hair-raising action, allow me to point out a few tidbits about this situation:A long barreled, heavy shotgun is a formidable weapon, but not terribly useful in close or confined quarters.A long barreled, deer hunting rifle is a formidable weapon, but not terribly useful in close or confined quarters.A Home Shopping Network faux-Rambo knife is not terribly formidable weapon in any situation.A slaughterhouse is chock-full of machines, beasts, conveyers, rollers and all sorts of other apparatus. It could be classified, if one were so inclined, as �close or confined quarters�.There were 3 miscreants. There were approximately 40 floor workers.Does the name �Custer� ring a bell?Of the 40 floor workers, most carry and are expert with huge, heavy and very, very, very sharp implements known as �butcher knives�. They also wear thick (1.5-2.5 cm) leather aprons (that go from neck to knees) and were capable of deflecting not only the errant swish of a very sharp butcher�s knife, but probably shotgun pellets and rifle bullets as well.They were intruders that didn�t know the floor plan.We were not intruders and did know the floor plan..They chose a door where they didn�t realize they were fully visible to the 10 or so characters in the break room, behind them, on their breaks.This is the part where things really start to get messy.There is no part 12.The three idiots (all sweating profusely in both their heavy parkas and heat of the slaughterhouse), were very intent on keeping the drop on the 5 or 6 of us on the floor, directly in front of them.They, alas, were not so nervy as to look anywhere but directly at us, menacing us with their formidable, but not terribly useful in close conditions, weapons. I was wondering if I could loosen the bolt on the bolt gun and let fly a few rounds (a la Darkman) in their direction, but it was a captive bolt gun, so that option was out.As it turns out, that wasn�t going to be necessary, after all.In the blinking of an eye, the guys from the break room had quietly (well, not terribly quietly, a slaughterhouse is not exactly known for its tranquility) eased out of the break room and were standing directly, and unbeknownst, behind the trio of malefactors.There were 4 or 5 master butchers, a couple of shithooks, a gut-buncher and a few carvers.Directly behind them and they hadn�t a clue (sorry about repeating the bleedin� obvious).WHAM! Parkas down, heads clubbed, aprons whipped, firearms grabbed, weapons removed, groins kneed and groins kneed.You said �groins kneed� twice.�I like kneeing groins�.Ooohh�it was messy.We return to a scene of near serenity. The three troublemakers were on the floor, coughing, retching, relieved of their weapons, their plans and most of what little dignity they could muster.�Well�, says Bruno, as he saunters up to the lead idiot and administers a solid size 13 to the breadbasket, �What are we going to do with these shitheads?�Remember, we are in a slaughterhouse, and the thought of these three ending up as Jimmy Dean�s Breakfast patties surely was paramount on what passed for thought in their tiny, little minds.Suggestions from the gallery:�Skin�em!��Build a bridge out of �em!� (No lack of Monty Python fans here�)�Chuck�em down a shithole!��Let�s give�em to Mongo!� (�No, that�s too cruel.�)Well, Blazing Saddles did come out that year�What actually did happen was that three of us larger types peeled these dipshits up off the floor and stood them against the far wall. They were too shocked, and in a reasonable amount of pain, to mutter much of anything beyond:�Please don�t kill us.��Don�t worry. We�re not that nice�.Did I mention that the walls of the slaughterhouse are lined with nice, thick wooden planks?Well, they are.So there.Louie, Luigi and one or two of the other master butchers pick these idiots up, one by one, and proceed to nail them to the wall (so their shoes were 6 or so inches off the floor) with their large, heavy butcher knives.No, not through anything vital, just through their parkas, jeans and fleshy parts. Of the eye in the third miscreants case.No. Not really. They didn�t draw a drop of blood hanging them on the wall, but these characters were well and fully immobilized and quite unable to move.At this point either their pain subsided enough or reality, in its never ending quest for enlightenment, broke through, and these three realized just what sort of predicament they were in.They copiously and in unison wet themselves.�Well, shouldn�t someone call the cops?�, asks Randy.�Yeah, I s�poze. It�ll probably take them at least a half hour to get out here.�, says Louie as he turns and leers in the reprobates direction, �I wonder what they�ll find?�Well, with all this excitement, the slaughterhouse closed down as a crime scene and with nothing much else to do until local law enforcement showed; the butchers, carvers and even a shithook or two passed the time by playing an impromptu game of darts, or vertical mumblety-peg, if you wish.After the initial subduing, there was never another drop of blood extracted from the three specimens tacked to the wall; but the bloody murder they screamed as each knife twanged into the wall bare millimeters from one or another vital area would have filled barrels.After the Police removed the three �social butterflies� and escorted them, shakily, to the local hoosegow, there was this huge mess that remained.�I ain�t gonna clean that up!�, exclaimed one of my hirsute co-workers.I later found out that he got a job in a quarry, mucking out slurry pits.



******************************



Fourteen years ago. I was in seventh grade. A family friend who was the youth pastor at our christian school picked me up and broke the news on the way to my house. Sometimes he'd pull me out of school and we'd get lunch and hang out. I assumed we were going to In-N-Out when he told me. I said, "okay" sarcastically and thought, that's not very funny. As we drove deeper into my neighborhood I realized he wasn't april fooling me. To be honest, I still have this feeling my dad's going to show up one year with an "April Fools!" But it hasn't happened yet.



******************************



Ok so this happened today, we recently moved and my dad was cleaning up the garage then I decided to help him,as I was going to throw a piece of trash I noticed a trash bad I asked my dad if it was trash he said yes I looked threw it and saw one of my first baby blanket,my boxing gloves my brother who�s in the army bought me a long time ago,and a birthday card,and a medal I got for donating 100$ to st.jude in a charity walk,the worst thing is my dad knew all this stuff meant a lot to me it�s almost like he targeted them



******************************



Have you ever had that one girl that you are really good friends with but you have feelings for her, and you don�t know if she feels the same way? You don�t know if telling them will ruin your friendship. And, you keep saying that you are going to tell them how you feel, but you know that you�re Yeah, me too. But the only difference is that I told her how I really felt. So, there is this girl. I think she is so beautiful and funny and every time we were together, I just had that feeling, but we have been good friends for a long time, and it wasn�t until right before we both left for college, when I told her that I had feelings for her. It was hard for me to tell her this because we were such good friends and I didn�t want it to make things weird.There was a time when I was dating a girl, we will call her Anna (not her real name) and it was a pretty good relationship. But like a lot of high school relationships, it came to an end. And I was pretty emotional, and this girl was the first person I called (literally) right after Anna broke up with me. Later that day we hung out and that made me feel better knowing that someone would always be there for me. This is when I started to **really** fall for her. Just being with her after that day, I started to look at her differently and I could see the same with the way she looked at me (or so I thought). So now it�s been about a year of me feeling this way about her and I decided it was time to tell her how I feel. Now I felt bad doing this over text, but it was hard for us to hang out a lot and I needed to tell her before we both went to college. So, I typed a long text telling her how I had feelings for her and how I wanted to know what she thought about that (my heart was racing at this point). I see her typing and she types for a decent amount of time and she says �oh really, I had no idea you felt that way about me. But if I�m being honest, I can�t say I feel the same way about you.� That hit me pretty **hard.**Me, thinking this whole time that she felt the same way and I was expecting her to say that she felt the same (but I guess not). But all in all, we are still good friends and we still talk to each other about things every day, but I still have those feelings and I don�t know what to do with them. But this shows that you can tell someone how u feel and if they feel the same way, then that�s great, but if they don�t, then accept that and you can still be there frien

When I was a small child, I was experiencing intrusive thoughts for the first time. I didn't know how to explain it. We had a huge cliff in our back yard and it gave me major L'Apple du Vide, so I told my parents that "Satan told me to jump off the cliff," and that He told me to throw my favorite toys down it.My parents acted really weird about it. At the time I had just heard about Jesus's temptation in the desert, and I was using that to try to understand why I had I had bad thoughts and why I was tempted to do things I didn't want to do.My parents didn't realise this and took me to church and had the property blessed

I was failing a very important class for my degree at the end of senior year. If I had not passed this class then I would have had to take it again during the summer and graduated in the fall. The title of this post is a bit of a hyperbole but if I had failed the class and not graduated on time then I would have had to explain it to the employers at the job that I had lined up. It wouldn�t have been the end of the world but it would have been a mess.This class was not particularly difficult but I had no motivation because it was senior year and because I already had a job lined up. I decided that I would meet with the professor of the class to try to explain to her why I failed and if I could retake the final or do some extra credit to make my grade at least a D. I emailed her and set up a meeting at 4:00 pm last Friday. I had to make sure that I was prepared for this meeting so I rehearsed what I wanted to say and wore a sweater and khakis to the building where her office was half an hour early.This professor is incredibly attractive. Her tits are average sized but are perfectly proportional to her body. I�ve only seen her ass a couple times because she lectures from behind a podium, but it is also perfect. Her pretty face and perfect body make her at least a 9.5/10, but I would probably give her the 10 because her authoritative lecturing style makes me want to submit to her fully and be her slave.It was 3:55 and I started thinking about the meeting, what I was gonna say, and how the professor might respond...And what the professor might wear, what she would look like naked and� Fuck. I tried to steer my train of thought back to the meeting but it was too late. My penis was erect.It wasn�t a semi erection. It was the type of erection that you get seconds before you climax. If my mind had continued down that path any longer I would have precum. But if it wasn�t a semi erection then why didn�t it hurt? I was wearing khakis, not sweatpants so� I looked down. The crotch area of the pants was looser than I thought and the material was stretchy enough to not cause me pain. This was one of those times where I would have prefered a painful erection because when I looked down I saw a 6 inch tentpole that would be apparent to anyone who looked at me.It was 3:58. My erection had not gone away. It was the longest 3 minutes I had ever experienced. It was like I had a priapism except it wasn�t painful. I calmed myself down and ran into the bathroom to masturbate. I might have been 5 minutes late but it was better than my professor seeing my erection while she probably already thought I was stupid and careless. She probably didn�t even know my name and what kind of a first impression is seeing someone�s erection underneath his khakis? I looked like I was just given a makeover and put into dressy clothes but you can�t makeover my primal urge to ejaculate all over my professor�s perfect tits while she steps on my testicles in her stilettos. This wasn�t helping. I couldn�t jack off to a fantasy of her. I needed pornography. I pulled out my phone and opened up safari but the internet didn�t work in the stall. At 4:00 I decided to calm myself down with a short meditation and walk into her office erection or not.I opened insight timer and breathed. It took three breaths to reach a point where I could maintain the intention to focus on the breath. A cold air brushed the roof of my nose and a warm air brushed past the bridge between my nostrils. Four. Five. My mind started to wander for half a second and I brought it back to the breath. Five and a half. I opened my eyes and looked down at my crotch. The erection was subsiding. I went back to the breath. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Focusing on these 5 breaths I remained mindful of the sensations in my penis. I opened my eyes after ten breaths and my erection was gone. It was 4:01. I left the bathroom and calmly walked into her office.�Sorry I�m late. I wanted to meet with you to talk about��She shushed me. �Are you gay?��No.�There was a delay with each response she gave me. �Can you prove it?� She asked.I thought for a second. I rolled up my sleeves and opened up my hands toward her. �Watch my hands.� I used one of my fingers to open up the pocket slowly in an effort to be as transparent as possible. My other hand reached into the pocket palm out and grabbed the sides of the phone without touching the screen. I handed her the phone. �Press the power button.� She pressed the power button and I told her my lock screen password. �Open up safari.� When I left the bathroom the porn video loaded. It was lesbian, no men at all. �Do you want me to prove I�m not bisexual?��No that�s ok. Can you read the bottom line of the chart.� She pointed at an eye chart on the back wall of her office.�N, P, X, T, Z, F, H.�She pulled a pencil out from behind her ear and pointed the eraser end at my crotch. �May I?�I nodded my head.She lightly tapped the bunched up khaki over my penis. The eraser bounced back and she tapped it again. Then she rested the eraser on the peak of the tent and slowly crushed it until I felt the pencil on my penis. I didn�t know what she would do next. She left the eraser there for another second. Oh no, it was coming back. I closed my eyes and breathed in through the nose and with each breath the eraser released itself from my penis. She pulled back the eraser in a way that almost perfectly mimicked my subsiding erection earlier in the bathroom. I opened my eyes to the professor making direct eye contact with me.Neither of us said a word. She didn�t blink for however long the silence lasted. It could have been anywhere from 5 seconds to a full minute. I don�t even know if this pause even happened because I was so in the moment. When she opened her mouth I snapped out of my dream state.�Well done,� she said. She went back to her desk and acted as if I wasn�t in the room. I stood there waiting for her to say something but I decided to break the silence.�So, about my grade.��Check online in half an hour.�I went back to my apartment and received a notification by email that one of my grades changed. I looked and she had changed my grade to an A. I don�t know how she did it without changing previous grades in the class, but she did.That weekend, I went into a deep depression. I didn�t leave my apartment. After three days I checked my phone and saw text messages from as long as 2 days ago. People asking where I am and if I�m ok. I checked the date to make sure I didn�t miss graduation but I still had a week left.I dropped the phone and and stood up. I walked into the bathroom, locked the door and looked in the mirror. My penis was semi erect and must have protuded through the hole in my underwear when I left my bed. I looked down and stared at the six inches dangling over my boxers. �I am a retard. I�m a tard, I�m a tard, I�m a tard. I�m a big fat fucking retard.�

Ok so at my school when you�re done with lunch you would go outside for outside time,this is when the story starts.so one of my friends go outside;I go outside a few minutes later,then I see my friend getting jumped,I try to break up the fight but it was time to go back inside,the next day comes and I brought my friends and they brought their friends.we agreed on a time,place,and how much people will be fighting;there was no limit on how much people would be fighting and it happened outside after lunch.on the day of the fight there was not 1 not 2 not 3 not 10 BUT 60 PEOPLE IN THE FIGHT! I go for the person that jumped my friend and I grabbed him and put him in a head lock,and threw him and I probably blacked out because I don�t remember what came after that,people that I grabbed his arms and made him punch him self and others said I stepped on his head,but after that I returned to reality I saw teachers,so I screamed �TEACHERS!!!!�and I swear it looked like that one scene from Ratatouille when the humans walk in to the kitchen and see the rats cooking;everybody just ran.and yeah this all happened in 6th grade.

This literally just happened 10 minutes ago. My mom just told me about an aunt who is the love child of my grandfather and another woman. My grandfather was a well respected man and he had 2 children with my grandmother (my dad and my uncle) I could not have imagined that he would cheat on my grandmother. Anyway she was born in 1991 and was the result of my grandfather's affair with another woman whom I must admit is way more attractive than my nan. My nan was aware of this but she disowned her due to her being an indication of my grandfather's affair. 4 years later in 1995 my grandfather died to due complications from liver disease. Before he died he sent my aunt�s family a little money so that her mother could look after her. She grew up without a father figure and only had her mother and grandmother for support. Fast forward 20 years to 2011 my dad and my uncle found her on Facebook and came to visit and finally accepted her as their half sister. She took on her mother's surname as she had no father. She is now doing pretty well working in Japan as an architect. She told my mom that I should consider a career in Japan (I�m 16M) but I was skeptical because I had never met this woman in my life and still haven't met her, but she is my family. My grandmother is unaware that we have reconnected with her, she might as well have forgotten that my aunt had even existed

Howdy y�all. I am friends with someone named... let�s say his name is Joe. Joe was alright. He was one of the semi-popular people at school. This was in 2017, at least. Two years later, I�m stuck with this dilemma. I�m with my two friends that will be named Jonathan and Joseph. They think Joe is a toxic person. I didn�t quite see it. Then, yesterday, September 1st 2019, he posted on his servers official discord: �HDHSHDHS now has ranks.� WHY? It�s not a mini game Servee, it�s not a Factions server. It�s SURVIVAL. But even Survival is a bit of a hard to grasp concept for him. He flies around in creative. He also gave his server a plotline. WHERE HE TAKES AWAY PEOPLES BUILDINGS. WITHOUT CONSENT. Might sound harmless, but here me out. You�re working on a nice house. It�s beautiful. Tomorrow morning half of it is gone. All the quartz you spend hours mining for is wiped away. Because Joe doesn�t understand the FUCKING concept of hard work. He likes to troll and kill people. Especially this person we�ll name Jack. Jack is the slightest bit annoying. He�s innocent and pure, though. He�s nice. I like him. Joe, in Creative, decides that he�ll kill Jack OVER AND OVER. Jack can�t fight back because he�s in survival and Joe is in creative. Jack left. Joe tells him to come back. Repeat. Eventually Jack can�t takes it and leaves the server. �BUT WHY?!?!?!! IM SUCH A GOOD OWNER I DON�T KNOW WHY HE LEFT?� He said. Probably because you bullied your only friend who doesn�t talk bad about you behind your back so much that he broke. Then there�s... we�ll call them �nders and M�dison. They live in the southern region of the server together. They live peacefully. They work to sustain themselves. �SURE WOULD SUCK IF I SPAWNED 5 ELDER GUARDIANS, HUH?� Joe says. �nders grew a hate for the server. About the plot line. He is willing to destroy the Ender Store I spend ages grinding for to make it work, but isn�t willing to even let a dent go in the wall of the store he built in creative. HE DECIDES THAT HE CAN ERADICATE MY STORE WITHOUT PERMISSION, BUT WON�T LET A FIST PUNCH THROUGH THE ROOF AND WALLS? HE CLAIMS HE WILL REDESTROY EVERYTHING PEOPLE BRING BACK, YET BRINGS BACK HIS OWN STORE? I can�t stand him. I�m a moderator on the server. A trusty one on that. I�m online all the time. Somebody happens to grief his base and HE FUCKING SAYS I DID IT? ME? The fact that he�s so quick to point fingers at his friends when something bad happens makes him so narcissistic. Friendship ended yesterday. Arrivederci, bitch.

This is about my neighbor. He�s always acted pretty normal. Him and my dad have been rly good friends for like 18 yrs and this guy has told my dad a whole bunch of stuff about his family and I�ve heard so much about him. Well today he showed up at our house (only my dad and some of his old friends were there) and just started getting drunk out of his mind. Like extremely drunk and passed out for a bit and woke up and started randomly walking around our house without asking. My dad said, �hey what are you doing� and he just kept saying �I�m alright, I�m alright.� Really creepy but later they just lost track of him so my dad looked everywhere for him and couldn�t find him. He checked outside and saw him sitting alone on the steps near the sidewalk. My dad asked what he�s doing and he said, �I fell,� my dad was like did you hit your head, or your back or someth- AH! He saw a bone sticking out of his ankle, like horror movie stuff, his foot was facing the wrong way with a bone sticking out. They called 9-1-1 and stuff and then my dad went to the guys house to tell the family, he said, �Hi, it�s mike�, and the wife says, who?Turns out that the family of the guy we have lived two houses down from, my dads friend for 18 yrs, comes over multiple times a week, has never heard of any of us. This guy has never mentioned my dad, or any of us to his family. So creepy, but when she finds out the ankle thing, the wife and the daughter don�t even pretend to act surprised, concerned. Do they hate him or what? My dad said he was coming from work and she goes, which work?WTF which work? Is this guy a spy, how much is he lying about? He has always said that he works at a hotel as the janitorial manager or something. TL; DR: Close family friend (neighbor) showed up and got extremely drunk, tripped and broke his leg, and it turns out that his family has never heard of us, and he lied about his job(s).Edit 1: Not really an update, but everyone on the block is trying to contact him and see if he�s in the hospital but he isn�t responding to any calls or texts.

3 days ago on 2020 New Year night I was home alone (cause I have no friends) and sad so I decided to go on "omegle" and it was like second time ever. So I was there like 8 hours straight and didn't get anything special but at last I met this girl. At the beginning I made a joke about the time cause for her it was like 6 hours till midnight and for me it was 1 after it, so I said that "So that means that I am in the future". She smiled. And it was the most beautiful smile I have ever seen in my life (ours camera was a bit bellow so we didn't see the eyes of each other. And we didn't talk, we were writing). So we were chatting for like a half an hour (which for me felt like few hours). So I said how it is difficult for me now, I did tell her my issues and stuff and she was so supportive. And I said her to never do drugs and make friends cause later you could get friends harder, like me. I'm 26 and she's 17. And I felt so affection not in a sexual way but in a person, like a friend. So we were just chatting about life, I said about lucid dreaming, cause that is my passion, and other stuff. She said things about herself. So at the end I said that she made me very happy and we waved and we ended the conversation.Later I was laying on my bed looking at the ceiling with few tears of happiness. I am not the type of guy who tears everyday, but these type of tears are the first ones in my life. I don't know If god or something like that exist, but that time I thought that something truly exists cause I met a real angel, so divine and pure. And I did not took her "instagram" or "facebook" or anything and I didn't know why. Well we would probably never meet cause we are like on the different sides of earth, but at least we could have been friends.Now I just know that we will never talk again. But I am very grateful that this is how New Year started. I wish you all the best year and years. And I would suggest not to hesitate, when you are meeting another lovely girl or a human being so kind and sweet, just exchange the social networks if you had the connection. These people are like diamonds, immensely rare. By the way I think I was interesting to her too.If there is a bit of chance that you are reading this, please PM me. (I know it may look stupid, but who know's how far it could go). Key words: Lucid dreaming, lapis lazuli necklace and pearl bracelet.P.S. I am sorry for my mistakes. English is not my mother language.P.P.S. It may be very naive or something but I just wanted to share it. There are always wonderful things happening in life. And I learned from this young lady that we need to accept ourselves for who we are. There are people that are like us and understands us.

Trigger Warning: Does contain some uncomfortable material regarding sexual harassment physically and socially. I was 17 when I joined a play hosted by our community. Wasn't big by any means, but just an all ages play and I really like that sort of thing. One of the people at this play, we'll call him Ray, was around 24-25. That being said, after our first rehearsal he grabbed my ass. I wasn't really alarmed at first because it was so shocking i didnt really process that. Besides, i played football where slapping asses was commonplace. So i ignored it. About three weeks until the show, he started insisting that we hang out. At this point I got freaked out and started being kind and saying no due to being busy. Eventually he found my Skype and started to ask for pictures of my privates, asked to send his, then if we could meet behind a bar for him to play with me. I kept telling him no but he did not stop. By the time he stopped texting me I felt so angry and disgusted. That being said, the next rehearsal I noticed an open room that wasnt being used that was pretty spacey. So i asked Ray to come into that room with me. He was pretty giddy about it. I just wanted to make sure when i told him off that if he said no or tried any advances, young kids wouldn't be seeing some guy getting beat up. So we go in the room and I told him with that same rage i felt the night before that I never want to see him do what he did again and how close he got to me just beating the absolute crap from him for how he grabbed me and talked to me. I told him straight up if he tries even an iota of sexual harassment I wont be giving him any more warnings. He was vividly scared and I think I couldve been less threatening but at the time the way he made me feel caused me to react impulsively (something which i have much better control now). I think one of my exact quotes was "I only brought you in here incase you tried something and I didnt want kids to see blood on the floor."Needless to say, he didnt ever pull that shit again. I asked advice about how I handled it to my girlfriend at the time and she seemed to let me just talk it out. What I felt most guilty about in this situation was that I learned later on that he had some mental issues and his insistent messages may had been from this and not due to an obsession. I feel terrible about how I handled it and I've learned to be a much more calmer and patient person. Anyways, this is the point. A few years later I realized through hearing stories and from exes that this behavior is common for women to experience; the main difference is that when women deal with behaviors like this they don't usually have the ability to intimidate or otherwise beat their aggressors to a bloody pulp (even of that's a very bad of going about it). In majority of cases, women simply have to accept this in public or deal with it using help of friends or leaving the situation. The only reason i could react the way I did was because Ive been beat up enough to not care about fights and most people who'd want to mess with me don't have 90-150lbs on me. After understanding this, I think I started to grow maturely on how to handle situations and overall respect people. I may have never went as far as Ray did, but Ray did teach me what to be mindful of and why I should care about how I treat anyone.Edit: Just rewording so the story flows better. Some of my sentences were structured in a confusing way.

So at my school we are allowed to go off campus to get food or do whatever, before lunch my friend texted me said hey do you wanna smoke weed at lunch. I was like okay what ever so we went to the beach (my school is next the the beach) and smoked I was chill and  acting stupid so I went back to school and I was gone. My eyes where fully red, so then I went to class and my teacher looked at me and said Aden come here. I walked up to her and she said I know you smoked weed at lunch but I�m not gonna say anything I smoke too, just put eye drops in next time. 10/10 teacher

Here�s what happened 11 years go as best as I can remember. Her name is Lisa.We lived in Eltham just by Avery Hill Park in south east London.I left home at about 7:15am to cycle to work in North Acton. I was only four days in to a new job at the same company. As far as I was aware she left for work shortly after. Her commute was longer and more complicated than mine, but it didn�t cost her anything. She worked as a childcare assistant in Parsons Green and had free travel as a perk from a friend of hers who worked for TfL.At about 11am I switched my phone on and had loads of voicemail messages from her work and the police asking me if I knew where she was as she hadn�t turned up for work and she wasn�t answering her phone and neither was I. I called them both back to explain that I didn�t know where she was and apologised for having my phone switched off. I called her numerous times over the next couple of hours as did the police and her work. It just rang and rang. No voicemail. She didn�t reply to text messages either. The police asked me to check if any of her friends knew where she was. I could only think of one person who she used to work with that she was still friends with, so I emailed her. She didn�t have many friends as she had trust issues.The police then told me they were going to visit our house at 2pm to check if anyone had broken in and asked if I could be there too, so I started cycling home. About 20 minutes into my ride home I got a text from her asking why I kept calling and texting her. She didn�t understand the gravity of everything that had been going on. She then gave me the first excuse. She told me that a friend of hers (the one I emailed) was feeling suicidal and she rushed to be with her and comfort her. I then rode back to the office after calling the police back. She called them too to explain. My new boss was very understanding and could see how stressed I was. Shortly after I got back to the office her friend that I emailed responded that she had in fact not seen her and wanted to know if everything was okay. I then called Lisa back to ask what actually happened to be met with accusations of spying and she then told me it was in fact a different friend (the one who worked for TfL) who was depressed and suicidal and asked her not to tell anyone. Fine. Lisa then told me that she told her work that she was sick and her phone was playing up, but she told the police that she had a domestic issue and couldn�t get to her phone. This was probably the worst excuse to give to the police. I got home that night at about 7:30pm and we had a long chat about the day. At about 10pm the police knocked on our door. Initially she told me not to answer the door (she was paranoid about getting burgled) so I hesitated not realising it was the police, so when I did answer they were suspicious that something else had happened. They asked to speak with her, which they did upstairs. They came down a short while later and left. She then told me the police were okay and she told them she didn�t want to press charges. Press charges for what? I sat downstairs for a little while and she went back upstairs to bed. I then went up and told her that I wanted her out of the house as soon as possible. It was over. We�d been together for 5 years and married for 4.I couldn�t take any more of her lies. This wasn�t the first time I�d caught her lying. She was a compulsive liar. She�d lie about unimportant things that weren�t worth lying about, but this was the straw that broke the camel�s back. I slept in the spare room, which she should have been sleeping in really. She moved out two months later on a weekend that I was away. When I got back the house felt very different. It was as if an exorcism had taken place. My life started to improve the very next day. The result is that I was able to start really saving money. I moved to Richmond a year later, met my partner, got a career, had a son, and now a house. If I�d stayed with Lisa things would never have improved as I was always broke and sometimes doing two jobs just to pay the bills, and I would have been constantly hoping things would get better, which was how much of 2007/2008 was spent.

So my uncle worked at a restaurant when he was younger. One evening when he was taking orders he heard these people being rude to his colleague while they were taking orders and his colleague didn't take it well.So when he was in the kitchen my uncle saw that his colleague was about to take the food to the people who were rude to him. But before he took the food he took out his penis and started slapping it on the food then gave it to the people.

I left for Canada when I was only 18 to pursue my post secondary education. I'm from India, so I'd travel home every summer break from Ontario back to India.During my summer flight heading back home I sat next to this lady who I later found out was very kind, smart and engaging. She spoke about how she's lived in Canada for decades with her husband and two daughters.We spoke about life, relationships and several random subjects. We began to talk about how I felt about Canada and where I wanted to settle down eventually.�Do you want to live in Canada?� She asked with a subtle smile.�I'd like to stay here for a few years and work, then head back home,� I responded.She chuckled while saying, �Wait until you find a beautiful Canadian girlfriend�that will change.�I laughed and we moved on with the conversation. I didn't think anything of it at the time.Fast-forward to 4 years since our conversation: I now have a beautiful Canadian girlfriend who's an amazing nurse.

          I know people are gonna say move past it and I have, but  she(ex) just makes it so weird. You know what, let me just try to give yall the story. I was fresh out of highschool,my friend who I had grown up with my whole life had just got engaged to his high school sweetheart(sil now). She was always trying to hook me up with her friend(my now ex). Eventually after months of hanging out, and basically the ex throwing herself at me I gave in despite some very apparent warning signs.          She had confided to me that both of her past boyfriends had been sexually abusive towards her, and that she often thought of killing herself. I thought that I could help her and show her that not all guys are like that. Little did I know what I was in for. Months go by of the same routine of me talking her down from panic attacks ,and off the perveribial ledge so to speak. Until one day I get this long message of how we are done because she just wasn't happy because of me. In the weeks prior I did everything I read about helping someone through depression; I even went and found professional help for her. You can imagine I was heart broken. I spent a year and a half developing feelings for this girl and she broke up over text with me on my birthday. Now I completely would have understood if she would have taken the time to actually do it in person, and tell me we just weren't right together, but this was anything but that. This event was pretty hard on my friend circle as SIL was my exes only friend, and she was just as worried as I was about her. Next thing I know she(ex) starts putting all these posts on Facebook about how I raped her and beat her, which was completely made up. For three months my entire friend circle alienated me as some sort of sick rapest type. Eventually she came clean about making all of it up.          My SiL's sister started messaging me and told me she never thought I was that kind of person ,and that she always wanted to be with me. Fast forward to today we are happily married. However my SIL is still friends with my ex and invites her to all of our events. I have tried to make peace with her, but she wont even look me in the eye let alone have a conversation with me. I like to think that she is just so embarrassed about what she made me out to be that she can't face me. I don't hold a grudge against her because I think she just has a sick mind. Anyways thanks for reading! Moral of the story don't ruin somebodie's reputation for no reason. I had family members question whether I was a rapist/abuser over this sick women.

Despite my username my dads side of the family is almost entirely Mexican with my grandfather immigrated to the US when he was 6 and took school there and at lunch time his mother would pack Mexican food for lunch and the other kids wanted a taste and they fell in love with it (this was before taco bell so Mexican food in the US was rare) later down the line kids would pay actual money for my grandfathers lunch so he started to load his bag with Mexican food and made a good amount of money (for a 6-8yo) after he turned 8 the school that he went to banned trading lunches basically shutting down my grandfathers black market of Mexican food

I'm fully aware the title sounds like clickbait but I don't' care I just would like to get these stories out:My sister is now 12 and doesn't attempt this anymore but when she was younger she would try quite a lot, I was maybe 7 at the time she was 4 it was 3 am and I woke up to get water when out nowhere she charges me with a knife cuts my elbow and then stabs it,i screamed and pushed her away from me which is when my mom woke up and yelled at us both, after my mom looked at my elbow she sais I was okay but we would go to the doctors later seeing as they weren't open yet luckily it wasn't deep enough to do anything but my sister got in a lot of trouble.About three years later I was getting into softball, when my neighbor found out he gave me a softball bat to use for practice, I was sitting in the grass and my little sister took the bat and hit both mu knees with it, I screamed and my neighbor came took the bat and got my mom,we went to the hospital,they said that if she hit any harder they would have broken,but I'm 14 now and my knees are fucked up and the nerve in my elbow causes my arm to freak out from time to time. My sister doesn't do these things after she got into counseling, but it scares to think of how she would end up like without the counseling.

So this happened like 20 minutes ago. I have 2 jobs at the airport. So for 3 sometimes 4 days a week I'm here for 15-20 hours. This lady came up to me complaining that I was walking to slow this is how that went.Her:why are you walking so slow? I've watched you from my seat.Me:I'm tired. Why were you watching me?Her:because you stick out from walking so slow how can you possibly be tired? God young people are useless..Me: well yesterday I was here.. For 15 hours today I'm here again for another 15 possibly 20 so I can pay to put myself back in school.Her:...Me: can I help you with anything else ma'am?Her: you should learn to respect your eldersMe: respect is given where it's due.. You came up to me complaining that I was "walking slow" and I should respect you? I don't think so. You have a wonderful day ma'am. I'm going back to work.

Years ago a man named Nedd grant was getting a psychology degree. A scientist emailed him and asked him to take part in a experiment, he agreed. The experiment was named 598-732. No cool name like project X, just 598-732. On 4/15/2005 at 3:20 Nedd went to the experiment. When he got there there was a rickety old house surrounded by a metal circle that was lifted a few inches above the ground. There were two other people there waiting outside the ring. Nedd walked up to them and waited with them. One of the people there was a sandy haired boy no older than 22. The other person was a girl with flaming red hair. The man said �hi my names Ryan, are part of the experiment to?� Nedd nodded.��My names Nedd.� Nedd said to Ryan. Ryan looked uncomfortable.��Ime Emma.� said the girl with red hair. At exactly 3:30 a man came out of the house. He walked toward them.�I am the lead engineer on this experiment. Please follow me into the house and be careful not to touch the ring, very delicate.� they followed the man into the house. Inside the house there where four chairs set orderly around a table. �Please sit down.� the man said. They all sat down. Ryan looked scared more than ever. The man dawned a very serious expression. �This is a top secret experiment ment for your eyes only. The project you will take part in is time travel. If you do not want to take part you may leave.��So your just going to let us leave even though we know this top secret information?� Emma asked the man.The man smirked. �We trust you not to tell anyone, and if you did do you think they would believe you?� no one responded to this. Ryan fidgeted as if he was going to leave but stayed in his chair. The man waited to see if someone would leave but they did not. �Okay then, my team will send you three hours into the future. Be sure to remember anything that happens to you or your surroundings. Oh and also, I can't guarantee your safety if you leave the house. We have tested on dogs and other animals before and recorded nothing wrong with there bodys after the experiment. Well, see you in three hours!� he said while leaving the room. Emma, Nedd, and Ryan all stood up and watched the ring through the widow. They look at each other and start to laugh.�No way this is real!� Ryan says. After fifteen minutes the ring starts to glow. It gets brighter and brighter until every where they looked was covered in a golden red light. And then suddenly nothing. Not darkness, not like you closed your eyes, just nothing. Nedd looked around and could see the room and the window sill but outside was nothing.�My heart stopped beating!� Emma screamed. Nedd checked his pulse on his wrist, so had his heart. Ryan kept looking into the empty void outside the window and said nothing. Emma and Nedd sat back down at the table. �There's something wrong about that� that� thing out there. I don't like it at all.� Emma said. Nedd stayed quiet. They all did nothing for hours. Or what they thought were hours. Ryan kept looking into the nothing every now and then muttering nonsense to himself. After a week of nothing they noticed they did not need sleep, they did not get hungry or thirsty, and they were bored out of their minds. They tried to sleep but to no avail. They noticed the room had no temperature, it was neither hot or cold or inbetween. Eventually they stopped breathing but where still alive. This whole time Ryan kept looking into the void until he said clearly and loudly,�Ime leaving. I want to know its secrets. It welcomes me.� he walked toward the door. Nedd and Emma did nothing to stop him out of sheer boredom they just watched blankly. He walked to the door and it creaked open. The void was right outside the doorway. He stuck his hand out. He then proceeded to pull it back and his hand was gone. There was exposed bone and flesh and tissue but no blood. He looked at his hand and smiled. He then walked through himself. The door slammed on its own behind him. After what felt like years Nedd and Emma started to play games like kids. They would play house they would play store clerk, what were they doing? Maybe it was there minds trading these moments for shreds of sanity. They did not know.�After what felt like a decade Nedd looked into the nothingness. The next thing he knew he was on the floor a stinging pain on his cheek. Emma was standing over him crying. �You were staring out into the void for hours! I can't do this alone!� Emma screamed at him.��I was out looking for a second not hours.� Nedd said to her. She just shook her head and tried to calm down. �Maybe if we looked out it would all end sooner.�Emma looked at him tears still in her eyes. �We should barricade the door to be sure.� Emma said. They did so. They took the table and chairs and put them all in front of the door and then sat down in front of the window and looked into eachothers eyes. Fear filled there souls as they got ready to look into nothing.��Ready?� Nedd asked Emma. she nodded her head and they held each other's hands as they turned their gaze toward the nothing.�As if it was no time at all there was a flash of light and they were back in the world. Nedd jumped up and took a breath for the first time in years. Or was it years? No it was just three hours. He looked behind him as he heard a scream, a loud blood curdling scream. Standing behind him was Ryan. Ryan ran to the window punched a hole in the glass, he then took a shard of the glass and with his hand bleeding stabbed his heart and fell back on to the floor. Nedd looked at Emma, she was lying on the floor. Her eyes were the void. The scientist came down to the house and froze when he saw the damage that had been done.The experiment was halted after the incident. Emma was in a catatonic state the rest of her life. Nedd wondered if she was still there, stuck in the timeless place he had hated so much. Nedd now dreaded sleep, when you sleep you see the void. You see it only if you know it is there. Nedd wishes no one has to know that feeling. He went to see Emma once, never again, he loved Emma but could not stand the void in her eyes. Nedd also wondered if that was what awaited him in death. He doesn't want to know.

Everything hurts



******************************



So I had a business teacher in year 7, which I think is the 6th grade for Americans, who was mentally handicapped. I thought it was just that but I later heard the full story a few years later and my friend told me to post it here.So the teacher was a normal guy until he had to have brain surgery, because of a brain tumour or anurism or something, which made him mentally handicapped, he was still able to function normally but he talked and acted strangely. Anyway, whilst he was recovering, his wife had multiple affairs and, after he started working again, continued 3 if the affairs for 5 months after, 1 of which with a teacher at his wife's school (she was also a teacher). He found out but forgave her, to which she took a mortgage out on their house, in his name, devorced him and took half his money. He had to sell his house and move into a small apartment. He became so depressed that the couldn't teach but the school didn't want to fire him just in case he killed himself, which they thought he would, so they only allowed him to teach year 7 business. He then got a therapy dog and his life continued like this for about 6 months, during which he took an anti-terrorism course and accidentally told a class 'how a successful terror attack could be done' which was reported and he was removed from the course. About 6 months after he got his therapy dog, he left his door open and it ran out into a road the hot hit by a bus right in front of him, as he walked outside to get it. He then quit his job and, the last I heard was, he doesn't leave his house and is tens of thousands of pounds in debt.



******************************



The beginning of my story:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/enqr5q/i\_am\_prisoner\_5017\_but\_i\_am\_not\_human\_none\_of\_us/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/enqr5q/i_am_prisoner_5017_but_i_am_not_human_none_of_us/) After all of the torture, I will finally be allowed to rest.I will still talk about the reviews that was before the quiet days because what else do I have to talk about.Before the quiet days, before the release, I was told to interview prisoner 085 and interaction with 1471 and 2935.After I re-contained 035 and 079 I was sent back down the site and was told to continue like nothing had happened. And I did what they asked.After learning who I could trust I felt much more comfortable and happy in general.Anyway, to the interviews.I was first told to interview 085. She is a sentient sketch, the artist who made her must have been very talented. She communicates through sign language or writing.I started the interview by writing 'Hello, I am prisoner 5017 but call me Steve.'She noticed the text and answered with 'Hello Steve. You are here to interview me right?''Yes.' (How in the hell should I describe a conversation by paper?)'What is it you want to know?''Please start with your sight on life in this moment.''It is okay. I wish I was able to be in the real world though.''I don't get to be there anymore.''Can you tell me about it?''Sure, tell me what you want to know.''How is it where you came from.''Last time I was there it was full of beautiful winters, comfortable summers and full of joy all-year around. We had such a good time everyday and we were always a little happy no matter what.''Where do you come from? It sounds amazing.''Sweden is where I was born. My family is a split between Canadian and Russian. I moved to Ireland. Did you know that there are very few snakes in Ireland.''What place were you describing?''Although I am Swedish by birth and Russian and Canadian by blood, I see myself as Irish. So, I was describing Ireland.''How did you get to america then?''I was on a trip with friends for a year and we needed jobs, We took a job here before I became a prisoner, I was killed and then I re-appeared and was contained. I miss Ireland.''I guess that is it then. Goodbye.''Goodbye.' She waved at me and I waved back and then left.I passed by 999 while I was at it. Surprisingly, I was let in.I remember its smile. It was the happiest thing in existence. It is just pure happiness.When it hugged my leg this time, I felt a different smell. It was of something I couldn't describe as one singular smell. It was a mix of my brother, Doctor, Beer and something else.Again, I felt like I could stand still for decades and not feel any stress at all.Sadly, I had a job to do. I told him the same thing i did the first time and went on my way.Prisoner 1471-1 is a wendigo like creature who follows you around but never harms you. The reason it is dangerous is because it makes you insane to the point of suicide.When I got 1471, Malo as it called itself, to follow me it wasn't really scary. I actually felt comfort. It tried to talk to me when I saw it but it never spoke it just moved its mouth up and down.Malo would appear behind corners, in the mirror and, sometimes, in the open but this was not supposed to happen.They counted that test as a failure but there was no way to get rid of Malo so I guess he is just with me now.I was transported in a heavily guarded van to 2935. I don't even know how to explain 2935. All i know is that it was what set me free.When we got to 2935 I was told to enter the cave. I did as they told.I was consumed by darkness when I entered the cave. I saw, heard and felt nothing. Not even my feet against the rocks below me. In the darkness I saw Malo and some skeleton like thing talking.I didn't hear what they were talking about but I know I heard words in the silence.I saw the people from my life who had died. They were looking at me with smiles. the smiles weren't forced. They looked kind. I felt something in my hand and when I looked down I saw that I no longer had skin, meat or muscle. I was only bone but I was still 'alive'. I felt no pain or tiredness. In my hand I held a scythe and when I looked back up, everyone was gone. Even Malo and the skeleton was gone.I left the cave and saw the sunlight. I was being aimed at by the foundations military."Who are you.""I... I am death."They backed away when I said it. Why are humans so scared of death? Why are they scared of me?Right then, it didn't matter. I walked past them and simply walked down the road. I walked until I came home. To my true home.I walked around the graveyard where my family was buried. When I found their graves they were spirits standing over them.I walked up to them and when I looked in their eyes, they were happy.I met them one last time before they left for the infinite sea.I was sat down by their graves when I heard a voice I never thought I would never hear again."Hello Steve." Dr Clef was as happy as usual.I didn't respond."You okay buddy?" Who would have guessed. Empathy from Clef."I am... Okay." My voice was hollow and low."I brought news and a friend of yours.""Hello death." It was they CI soldier."You are alive?" My surprise was hard to hear through my voice."Yes, after what ever you did in that cave, everyone in the world became friendlier towards other. CI and the foundation got into an agreement and we revealed all the prisoners and technology to the world. We are currently preparing a shuttle for space travel." Clef piped up before my friend could answer."They want you to come with the first exploration team as the captain." My friend said in a tone that was happy and exited."I am coming with you." I sat up with my scythe in hand and started walking towards them.I am the new death and I will undo my work to bring back my family. In what ever way I need to.Oh, I bid farewell to the port and the land,  And I paddled away from brave England's white sands.  To search for my long ago forgotten friends,  To search for the place I hear all sailors end.As the souls of the dead fill the space of my mind,  I'll search without sleeping till peace I can find.  I fear not the weather, I fear not the sea;  I remember the fallen do they think of me?  When their bones in the ocean forever will be.Plot a course through the night to a place I once knew,  To a place where my hope died along with my crew.  So I swallow my grief and face life's final test;  To find promise of peace and the solace of rest.As the souls of the dead fill the space of my ears,  Their laughter like children their beckoning cheers.  My heart longs to join them, sing songs of the sea;  I remember the fallen do they think of me?  When their bones in the ocean forever will be.When at last before my ghostly shipmates I stand,  I shed a small tear for my home upon land;  Though their eyes speak of death filled with struggle and strife,  Their smiles below say I don't owe them my life.As the souls of the dead fill the space of my eyes,  And my boat listed over and tried to capsize.  I'm this far from drowning, this far from the sea,  I remember the living do they think of me?  When my bones in the ocean forever will be.Now that I'm staring down at the darkest abyss - I'm not sure what I want but I don't think it's this -  As my comrades call to stand fast and forge on -  I make sail for the dawn 'till the darkness has gone -As the souls of the dead live for'er in my mind;  As I live all the years that they left me behind, I'll stay on the shore but still gaze at the sea.  I remember the fallen and they think of me;  For our souls in the ocean together will be.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVkD4lgXTEU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVkD4lgXTEU)

- I am a first-time poster.- English is not my first language.- Names were changed to protect identities.I was in high school when I first met Berenice, she had a bright smile and a cheerful attitude, but beneath that baby face and wide hips she was a thinker and a natural leader; that is what I admired of her the most.I was a timid and so it took me a couple of years to get to know her.She was popular among her classmates�many of which were mean girls who called me names.Nevertheless she was kind with me and I managed to spend a lot of time with her talking about the big questions in life: politics, science, philosophy, the future and whatnot.No other girl in that class could handle a conversation like that.I had fallen in love.Unbeknownst to me Berenice had been longing for Simon, a good friend of mine, so the day I decided to confess to her (near the end of high school) it went bad.How bad?I was shaking in nervousness so much I could barely force my self to walk up to her, and as soon as I started talking her friends came nearby.I must have been a traumatic experience because **all I can remember after that is Berenice laughing so hard at me while I run away from her**.Eventually Simon and Berenice began to hang out but there was no chemistry and their relation did not last long.I spent the last days of high school watching from the shadows and wanting to forget. Life went on and I really never grew up to be confident.I did meet other girls, but my thoughts went back to Berenice every once in a while, specially whenever I got rejected or was too afraid to confess.Some years later I was running late for university so I took an alternate route, that is when she and I bumped into each other during a morning commute.We talked as if nothing had ever happened and I felt a big relief... no, I felt *distilled joy*.I was so happy I forgot to ask her new phone number, so I adjusted my commute in the hopes to see her again, but that would not happen for five years.Many stories later, when I was starting my PhD I was sure that I would not see her ever again, but then on a fateful day that happened.It was by accident just like before, but this time it was different... she was carrying a child in her arms.The dad was nowhere to be seen, so we went to have a great time at a nearby park and we laughed like children ourselves till the afternoon.I could not let her go again so I asked her for a date, alas, she rejected me arguing that **she now knew what are men seeking in her** and wanted to stay friends.I just thanked for her time and went on with my life.By this time social media was booming, and so we got to chat every now and then.One day she admitted filling guilty for the way she rejected me in high school�just 10 years after the fact�and she actually asked me for a date.Berenice had enough of children movies so we went to see an R-rated comedy.I could feel some tension between she and I during the projection, specially during the sex scenes, but I refrained from anything because of what she told me before.After that she was beaming with joy and she said she wanted to go out with me once more.I agreed to go to a restaurant next time and truth be told it was funnier and more exiting.After that day we started to talk about our sex lives, how she cheated on her partners and other NSFW stuff; but she also tell me every now and then how she really liked me, so I was confused and had no idea where our relation was heading.Internally I had decided that I would try again next time.But that next time would not came to be: I got stood up by her three times, always with different excuses and she always apologised profoundly.I could not understand this mix of signals so I started dating another woman.Months later, when the relation with this woman was over, she told me she would go after me next, but that did not happen either.I ended up marrying a wonderful woman (that's another story) and having a child of my own.I did not want my wife to think that I would be a cheater, so I stopped talking to Berenice and other girl friends by my own decision.Turns out this is not a good idea because now she accuses me of infidelity as soon as I talk to some other woman.Another 10 years has passed by when I noticed that Berenice was stalking my social media profile.It started with a Like in an old photo; I asked about it and she told me how she was explaining high school to her child.Apparently I was being used as an example of a friend and a very successful man.Then she asked if we could hang out once more.At this point I am not looking for love anymore, I just don't want to die with the remorse of not having lived a life.So I carefully set up a date and suddenly the night before I am feeling nervous and excited just like 20 years ago.I knew in my heart that she would not show up and instead would spend the day with her newest boyfriend. That morning she did not even answer my texts, nevertheless I went there all by myself, sat for an hour, remembered how it has been up until now, dropped a tear, and went on my way.

Sad boi story time.So i have liked this girl since freshman year (im a junior rn) and we have been a little off ab liking each other but i feel like its always been there a little. Half a year ago her brother died and it put her through a lot. I always made sure i was there to talk to and be there for her and would always pick up a call or ft. After like three months of face timing on random nights and sitting next to her in class she admits that she likes my best friend to me over ft. I was pretty crushed as i was hoping that she was into me but i talked to my friend ab it and he said that he �didn�t like her like that�. Another 2 months go by and right when i think its my turn i find out she likes my neighbor and guess what, he doesn�t like her back. I also found out that she knew ab me liking her and around that time she stopped ft me. This Christmas i just decided that sitting next to her was too much torture (and so was APUSH lol) and i switched around my schedule to be in a different chem class without her. Winter break ends and she starts snapping me saying that she misses me in that class and stuff like that but after years of telling myself ill never be good enough for her (the other 2 guys previously mentioned actually have abs lol im hella weak) i just blew it off. Two nights ago she starts snapping me and asking things like when did i like her and i basically end up telling her how i have liked her since freshman year. She had been hinting ab how she liked me back and i swear to god i have never sweated over something more over phone. We talk ab it and decide to hang and feel it out when i get back from vacation and that night i was ecstatic. Two days go by of light talking but tonight i got the snapchat. Shes saying that shes not ready to date and she has to get her stuff sorted out and take care of herself. I tell her its fine and i understand.I don�t understand.How can you �be ready� to date 2 people before me but not me. This is so fucking crippling to my self esteem as im sitting here looking at a lil bit of fat on my belly and chin and thinking ill never be hot enough for her. On top of that right after her telling me shes sorry for ending things she takes a pic w this super buff dude captioned �my favorite person� and sends me a snap of them up close. Ik i would be there for her everyday and be a better bf than those other guys. I just feel like a drunk idea that shes thinking wouldn�t work out. Ik alot of this sounds shallow ab like the body part but it�s honestly the only thing i feel like i can credit bc ik how great we would be together. Thanks for reading.

My cousin got so drunk once that she got a red candle and started woshipping it, asking it to get her ex bf to love her again. After screaming and crying for an hour, she asked her roommate,"Kill meeee I dont want to live without him!!! Kill me please!!!"Her roommate who was just as drunk complied by covering her entire face with a pillow.She screamed, "I cant breathe!! Help me!!!"Edit: she's ok of course. Her friend took off the pillow after that

So this may be hard to believe, but during my Junior and Senior years of college, Brad Pitt�s nephew was my roommate. I had no roommate first semester because I was a host for prospective students, but I quit second semester, so I had to get a random roommate. Having your own room was a perk of being a host. So my new roommate was Brad�s nephew who had basically failed out of Arkansas University, and whose parents had told him he had to go to school in their hometown (Springfield, MO, where he, his family, Brad, and I are all from) as punishment for not doing well in school. When he first got to my school, he had orientation with other transfer students from other schools to make them all feel welcome and at home. During that orientation, he met another transfer girl who just so happened to also be coming from Arkansas University but he had never met. He didn�t really get to talk to her, but he was crazy about her. He would talk to me about her and I could just tell she was like a 10/10 to him. At points he basically told me he was going to leave her alone bc he didn�t have the confidence to talk to her, but I called him a pussy and dogged on him multiple times to keep him from giving up. I left school one year before him, but the year that I left, her brother just so happened to be moving onto our floor in our dorms the next year. We all played basketball together during my last year, and so when the girl�s brother moved onto our floor after I left, their friendship grew and it was an in for my roommate to meet the girl he was crazy about.Long story short, they are now married, and I�ve never seen someone look so happy with their significant other. Every time I see a picture of them, I can�t help but feel a little responsible and happy for calling him a pussy so many times :)

so i was doing some reminiscing and thinking about the time me and my girlfriend were driving through a university district in tennessee (i�m from texas, she�s from tennessee) during a football game, and her cars brakes went out. she panicked and i reached over and grabbed the wheel, maneuvered through the opposite way of traffic, dodged 5 cars... from the passenger seat.. and stopped JUST in front of a cop with the E brake. my girlfriend then proceeds to absolutely PANIC and goes non verbal from anxiety... because, well, her license was suspended, and i didn�t have mine. i decided to get out of the car, try to sweet talk the cops, and get us out without having to show our IDs, or take down any info. so i told the cops i was in the first day of my college tour, i�m all the way from texas, no money in my pocket, just trying to see my girlfriend, who has severe anxiety, and that that has never happened with her car before. the cops told me everything is okay, comforted my girlfriend, and called us a tow truck to get us on our way. i�m not sure what fines we could�ve gotten, but i�m sure reckless endangerment, driving the wrong way, and failure to stop.. we got lucky for sure

I swear my dog is a sentient, petty, bastard. I give this dog a thumbs up and he just stares at me. I think �Shit what am I doing� So then he just stares at his own foot them gives me this indignant look of betrayal as if to say��How DARE you. JUST because YOU were lucky enough to have apes as ancestors doesn�t mean you can SHOW OFF your��OPPOSABLE� thumbs. And the day before this little shit is going through the bin, i scream at him and he has the AUDACITY to look annoyed. I yell at him to go to his bed, he *ever so slowly*�gets up to walk to his bed, looks at it, looks at me and sits down. RIGHT next to it. Good lord. I want a cat.

I�m was 8 years old and my brother was 4 years old. Three months ago my brother�s friend died when a train hit him. One month later my brother started getting insomnia. He would wake up in the morning with bloodshot eyes. He started getting hallucinations. He started seeing his dead friend when he wasn�t there. He took him everywhere and would never leave him. Whenever the friend gets lost sometimes, my brother would catch a fit and pound his fists on the ground telling my parents to go back and get him. My parents keep telling him that he�s not real. But it�s always the same excuse my telling them he is. One day they gone outside and got too far from the yard. They were playing on the same railroad track the friend died. I was looking for him and found him on the railroad track. I tried to save him but it was too late. He got hit as blood spatter everywhere on me. I told my parents after the death of him. 3 of us cried at the funeral. One week after the funeral my dad started drinking beer, my mom tried to kill herself, and I started to suffer from depression. I�m now 23 years old and I still remember the death of my little brother. That was the saddest life experience I�ve ever had. And death is the hardest you�ll ever experience too.

So I live in England so our schools don�t really go through loch down practice so this was quite new and scary for everyone. So we were in the start of Year 8 (12/13yo) and everyone knows who is who and what they are like for the most part. There was a boy with autism who was from Lithuania who spoke very little English and didn�t really know how to behave. Unfortunately for him, he fell into the wrong group and they started using him to do some of their pranks because they knew he�d get into less trouble.One day he came into school and told the group that he had been given a BB gun. The group were very happy about this and asked him to bring it to school the next day. Because he was scared of them calling him a pussy, he did bring it in. At first he just kinda showed it to them and nothing really happened, but that changed soon.At break time, the kids dared him to shoot a plant pot which he did and they found it hilarious. They then went to an old unused part of the school and got him to shoot a window. They kinda started forgetting about it after that which made the kid sad so he said he�d try and shoot someone. This really got them interested so the kid thought he�d really have to do it. They found someone that they really didn�t like and shot him in the back. He screamed in pain and fell to the floor.Unfortunately, they were in a place where there aren�t many teachers but some friends of the kid ran to get them. At this point the kid thought he was screwed so he shot one of the ones who went running because he thought that would mean no teachers would find out. This obviously didn�t work because everyone started screaming and running so all the teachers found him and managed to pin him down and disarm him.He was expelled the next day which was pretty fair but absolutely nothing happened to the kids who had egged him on the whole day and those pieces of scum are still roaming around like they own the place.

Now this happened before the winter, when my truck was sitting on a trailer, and was just bought. But that's details, and I'm still confused on it myself.So here's the story; My parents decided that I was responsible enough to work on a vehicle (after proving that I could keep my grades up), but my dad pulls into the drive way after school, with my truck on the trailer with his truck pulling it. Now keep in mind, my family has a thing, where the first vehicle is a truck or something  with mildly good ground clearance. Anyways, so my father pulls into the driveway, followed by a man, I'll call Tim, Tim drove a Ford F350 and could see that it wasn't his vehicle, but continued to follow my father. Well a little while after my dad parked his truck near our barn, my mom came into the house and told me to come out side. So I did so, not realizing that Tim was out there talking to my father about my truck and how he had one just like it, learned that later, but I come outside to see my truck on the trailer, and my dad talking to Tim. As my mom and I walk up, my dad turns and smiles at me, soon digging in his right jacket pocket for something. And this is where I don't know if this should be in r/entitledpeople or not, but here is goes, and I remember this perfectly.Dad: "Son you have shown us that you can keep your grades up, and that you have stepped up with chores."Mom: "And we have a surprise for you."Now this is what's going through my mind, since I see my truck, and Tim standing next to my parents and my truck. I knew it, that the truck was mine, but I didn't know this next part, because this happened so fast.Me: "I'm going to guess that you guys have a truck for me?"Mom: "I think we should have hid it."Dad: "Yeah, but yes son, this is your truck."Tim: "What!?"At the same moment my dad held the keys to my truck, and within a few seconds, Tim took the keys, and started to run to his truck. Now with my dad, and my mom both having a concealed carry, my dad pulled his concealed carry, and shot at Tim's truck tire, and that stopped Tim in his tracks. So my dad walked up to him as my mom called the police, we only waited about 5 minutes until an officer showed up, and the officer who showed up, was he chief. But I can go into details in another post if I need to, but overall it turns out that Tim was wanted for multiple grand theft cases, and was on probation, but my dad was fine, because the chief only said that my father did the right thing, and that Tim would be arrested for attempted grand theft,  on top of the other accounts, now I have my truck, and the police stop in to see how it's going, at the time I got it, I was 17, well just turned 17 and now my trucks going on 23 years in June, but that would be my story, and sorry for the bad punctuation and grammar, I'm on mobile,  but hope you guys are having a good day, and if you would like to see more let me know, bye for now.

This story is about real events I had when I was a little kid, I was born in a neighborhood where at the time some "not so nice people" were there, I would not say criminals or gangs because it was not that kind of a bad neighborhood, I was liked by most kids in kindergarten and first grade, but some kids liked to steal from others including me, then saying I hit them, swore or stole their toys that were actually mine, I was never believed by the teachers and the principal did not like me, so my family decided to move to another city.In my new school everyone in my class did not like me at all, except one kid who was really kind, but the queen of the class told him to stop hanging out with me, everyone bullied me, when I told a teacher she asked "Who in the class wants to play with (OP) after the bell rings?" and no one spoke except another kid,  after the bell rang he came up to me and said "I am sorry but the queen of the class told me to not play with you." and just walked away to play with the rest, it might be worth mentioning that I looked different than the rest of the kids,  the color of my skin was different and I my hair looked weird. That of course started my depression.When we moved to a friendlier city, where my childhood friend (he is still my friend) lived, everyone liked me with no exception, so we stayed there for another year, in that next year, without seeing it coming, I was bullied by most of the kids except those "weird kids" if you know what I mean, we all hang out in and outside of school and everything was great except that my childhood friend also turned into bullying me, this made me lose faith in everything, I was sad all the time and always had suicidal thoughts, I just did nothing except play on my computer all day after school and sometimes hang out with my friends and sometimes just sit alone in the class and draw things, I got into a lot of fights, and I was surprised to find out I am not bad at it.One of my friend's older brother passed away because of a heart condition he had, our teacher we will call TR asked for one of my notebook, I did not write a lot in my notebooks because I preferred to draw so I hesitated but I had to, so I gave her it, days later she calls me in a lesson to come outside of the class, I come out and she and the supervisor sit in front of me and give me my notebook, TR then says; "After your friend's brother passed away, he received death threats on a note, we compared the writing to yours and turns out it matches." she then puts her phone on the table, maybe she was recording but I have no clue "Why did you send death threats to your friend?" I said could hardly talk because of the shock, I then said "I did no-" "Yes you did!" the supervisor shouted at me "Just tell us why you did it and why you would think you could get away with it."I just cried and run away and waited for school to end, I walked home and I did nothing except think of ways to get myself killed, I felt like I was choking from anger and I could not believe what I was said.The next day I talked to my friend and asked him "I don't know what happened but please believe me I did not send you death threats." He told me that he never thought that it was me and he thinks the teacher is lying, I still had a hard time finding a way to conversate with him after all that happened, so I had nothing I could do except cut myself out of his life he is now learning in some science high school in which only the best students could be in.We did stay there because we had nowhere else to go, at high school we were still in the same city, my childhood friend apologized to me saying how stupid he was and how his other friends converted him into a bully which I don't blame him for, so I forgave him, I still had depression and and a lot of kids did not like me, but they did not bully me because I beat up a lot of their friends, I found myself new friends and we hanged out all day long and playing video games together, late 2018, 8th grade my depression was cured and I moved to the same city I was born in, I am now living happily and I feel like a champion.End of story.

ok so yesterday i was home alone and someone started knocking on the door, so i went downstairs to see who it was. keep in mind that in 14 and my door has a big glass part you cans see through it was also obvious no one was he because he was knocking for about 5 minutes. i�m on my stairs and he is looking the other way so i sneak past my door and i notice it�s not locked, i also don�t know who this man is/was, so i lock the bottom lock (which doesn�t always work). as i�m locking the bottom he looks through the glass. i quickly tried to lock the top lock ( you have to push the door for it to lock but i couldn�t) as i see his hand move to the door handle, but he pulled it the way the door closes instead of opens and i successfully locked the door.  i literally watched him put his hand to the door and look through the glass as i was standing to the side so he couldn�t see me and then i watched his hand move from the glass to the door handle. then after i locked the door he tried a few more times  but since i locked it he couldn�t get in so he got in his car and drove away. i�m surprised i handled it the way i did and didn�t freeze. now i�m scared of what is going to happen today but i think i can handle it. i�m also terrified of being home alone now.update: he came back today but saw my brother downstairs on the couch and went away.

So this past weekend in Florida is a Vacation I�ll never forget.. its like one of those stories you hear on the News where you dream that one day  something like this could happen to you. We�ll start On Saturday. The day was lackluster at best, you know those awkward family vacations where you feel out of place especially around your family... to make everything worse, we were in a state where we knew no one and finding some good bud was near impossible. We managed to get 2 fat joints on the Plane, hidden very well of course, but after that it was CBD from then on. It wasn�t the end of the world but, FUCK when you go a week without pot it feels like an eternity. It truly does make everything better especially when your stuck with family for the entire week. So I had the Idea to rent a Scooter. (I HIGHly Recommend Renting a Scooter while on Vacation in SoFlo.) We cruised all up and down the coast from DeerField Beach all the Way down to the beaches in Fort Lauderdale. On the way, we went down Hillsboro Mile (which is where the story gets Juicy later into the Story) where the entire Mile is Full of Homes that only the 1% can afford. I Loved it, what an experience it was. I know I won�t have that kind of money anytime soon, but hey it definitely got me MOTIVATED!!! As we were Scootin past these homes, I pulled into a Vacant Lot in between 2 Multi Million Dollar homes and drove all the way up to the beach and parked. Man, what a view, It got me thinking, �how often do these beaches get used?� I didn�t see a single person in sight, I knew as of then that I wanted to explore this area of the beach before I leave to go back to the boring Midwest... so we left and continued south until we were in Fort Lauderdale. We stopped and had Lunch at a small Italian place called Kisses of Italy. I ordered Chicken Parm that wasn�t even on the Menu (Best Chicken Parm Sandwich EVER) and my Gf had a Hotdog Sandwhich (3 Hotdogs on a toasted bun with toppings.) After a great Lunch we went back home to relax after a great Scooter ride. Scroll forward about 6 hours and we are headed to the Casino because we can�t seem to get her family to do anything other than sit at home.. (were on vacation, so we don�t wanna just stay home) when we arrived at the Casino, we each took out $60 (TIP. Only take out $60, if you lose it GO HOME, if you gain $60 back, pocket it and DONT TOUCH IT, continue to play with your winning, until you either lose what you had profited or are ready to be finished) and headed straight to the Roulette Table. I started with my $60 and it was gone within 10 minutes and she put in $20 and it was gone after 2 minutes. (It was on a Red Streak and I refuse to play Red) We went outside to smoke a CBD Joint and are prepared to lose the rest when we go back inside. So when we go back in (after about 30 minutes) we see that the tables have turned and my LUCKY number 33 has been hit twice as well as a slew of other black numbers. We then put in the last $40 and got up to $200 in a matter of minutes. I think we had a number get hit 5 times in a row with $2-$3 on the number plus $75 on black. Needless to say we made our money back and profited $800 for the night! We left at 12:45am and got to sleep around 2:00am. We woke up on Sunday at 7:30 to spend our last few hours on Florida on the Beach. (I didn�t wanna get outta bed) After sleeping an entire week on a crappy blow up mattress and having little sleep the night before, my body was telling me to stay in bed. We got to the beach around 8:30 and stayed until 10:00. I made sure we had enough time to go to the Spot I mentioned the day before. So we get home and hop on the scooter and head for Hillsboro Mile. (There is only 1 public entrance to this beach and its at least a 1/2 mile walk in the sand to get to where I wanted to go, so we took the scooter to the very last Condo Building before the Row of Mansions on Hillsboro Beach. All the parking spots were numbered so I just parked in the covered area by a door to get inside. There was only 1 sign that said no Trespassing unless your a resident, and there was a Chain going across 5 posts about 3 feet high. We hopped the Chain and were to the Beach within a minute or 2. There wasn�t a person to be seen in the area, which is something I have wanted for awhile. Technically all Florida Beaches are Public Property, so we weren�t breaking any major rules. We started walking down the beach toward all the mansions. (I Recommend this walk for anyone that comes to the area. It�s extremely peaceful, just make sure you respect the beach and make it look better than when you got there.) As I got to about the 3rd Mansion I saw an elderly man in the distance and he saw me eagerly looking for Cool Seashells at the beach. When he got close he took off his headphones and told me that he saw a package on the beach a little ways down that had appeared to be drugs of some kind. He didn�t want to have anything to do with it, but seemed like he wanted me to take care of it. So we keep walking another 500 feet or so until we see what the man was talking about. It was a vacuum sealed black bag that was wrapped in multiple layers of plastic to form that of a brick. It had the Sun of Uruguay on the front (the Cartel Logo) it appeared to have been in the Ocean for a very very long time, but also appeared to be sealed still. (Keep in mind our flight leaves at 5:00pm and it�s currently 11:30am) so my GF takes off her shirt and we wrap it in the shirt so it doesn�t look Suspicious and we start walking back to the Scooter. At this point we had already made a video of finding it on the beach and we took a few pictures of it. (At this point No one knew about this except us, the old man was long gone by this point too) we put the brick under the seat of the Scooter and start heading towards her dads house. (Yes we�re just cruising around with a 30k brick in a cheap $500 scooter.) When we get to the house we pull into the Garage and show them what we found, and they literary Flipped! They kept trying to tell us we were going to get a possession charge or something even worse. They wanted us to go find a trash can and go throw it away. I didn�t agree with how rash they were thinking. (Technically we didn�t do anything wrong, we took the package from the beach so someone else didn�t get their hands on it, and at this point we were pretty set on going to turn it in) So we unwrap it from the shirt and put it on a Walmart bag and bag into the Scooter seat and we start heading to the Police Station. The Scooter has to be turned in at 12:00, and I didn�t wanna potentially get held for questioning and get a late fee, so we pulled over and call 911, I told them the short version of the story and they send a BCS out to meet up with me and we opened the Seat and he opened the bag and said that�s quite the find!! We told him where we found it and what our intentions were and he was SUPER COOL, we had a few questions about the brick and he answered all of them and talked to us about it. He took our info and asked us about our local college football Teams. All in all it was the Craziest way to end a Vacation. I�ve been back now for 3 days and can say we are moving to Florida at the end of April. I�m an adventurer at heart and after finding the find of a lifetime it has motivated me to move to Florida to start our Fun Filled Life. I do want to say that I have never done this Product and know nothing about it. I know this could have been the Best/Worst thing that could have happened to me. I have also imagined so many other ways I could have handled it. Either way I�m happy it won�t end up on the Street even though I potentially gave up 30-100k worth of Pure Untouched Product. If you read this entire thing, I want to Thank you and welcome you to the Crazy Life I�m Living in. Follow to stay up to date with when I move and start searching the Beach again. Until then...

It was 2018 and my husband were trying to make our marriage work. I was packing my things to move back in with him. I was ready to be his wife again. He and I were talking over the cell phone and I mentioned things needed to change. I wanted him to be less controlling and be more understanding. He texted back that he was going to divorce me and he didn't want to be with me. That I was not the woman for me. I told him I loved him and needed him. He made me cry and cry. The hard part was it was almost my birthday.He texted me back a few days later. He was going to give me a chance. I went to the store and bought him a hat. I came home and found a message. He had found an old Facebook account and saw a picture that he thought was revealing. He called me names and made cry even more. He told me he would think about taking me back if a broke my tablet. I couldn't do it. I had support and was told not to break it for him. I had gone through too much abuse for years. Later on he made a Facebook saying terrible things about me and saying I was abusive. It was hard to read. My birthday went by and divorce papers came in the mail. I cried. I was happy I no longer was in an abusive marriage but blamed myself. I couldn't go through it and find a lawyer. So we are still legally married but I have not seen or spoken to him in over a year. I don't blame myself. What he did was wrong. Emotional abuse is just as bad a physical abuse. I still have my moments but it has made me stronger.

Two years ago, my wife had surgery to remove a growth "the size of a rugby ball" from her abdomen.  By the time it was over, she had more blood from transfusion than from her own body.  Today I gave blood for anyone else who might need it.  It's not a very exciting story, but I felt the need to share, and to say thank you to anyone else who does the same.

Once upon a time, there were two brothers.  One was older, one was younger.  The younger brother looked up to the older brother.  One day, the younger brother was playing a video game and he was stuck on a really hard level.  The younger brother knew the older brother was really good at video games, so he asked him for help.  The older brother was exhausted and didn�t want to play, so he told his younger brother that he wouldn�t help him.  This made the younger brother very sad, but he didn�t want to annoy his older brother so he said, �Okay,� and continued to play.  Overhearing what had happened, the boys� mother gently pulled the older brother aside and said to him, �Your brother looks up to you and he�s asking for your help.  I think you should help him.�  And so, the older brother sighed, knowing that he had to be patient with his younger brother.  After all, the younger brother didn�t understand that the older brother was exhausted and stressed because he was too young and hadn�t yet had the responsibility his older brother had.  The older brother, listening to his mother�s advice, sat down and helped his younger brother.  Then he helped him with the next level, then the next, then the next, growing tired and weary and stressed as time passed and he didn�t complete his work.  When the younger brother finally tired of playing and went to get ready for bed, the older brother sighed and turned off the gaming console and put the controllers away and turned the TV off.  He went to his backpack and took out a textbook and began working diligently until hours too late to imagine so he could get a good grade and make his parents proud.  And the mother, contemplating grown-up struggles of her own that even the older brother couldn�t yet comprehend, smiled and cried and watched the boys grow up.I know my brother won�t see this because he doesn�t follow me on here, but I wanted to kind of throw this out there as he gets closer to getting his undergrad degree.  I love him and I�m proud of him and I�m thankful that he used up his own time taking care of me when I needed it and when my parents needed it and he STILL breezed through school.

Last night I was playing minecraft but I was getting tired. So I decided to make an afk fishing farm. I let it run all night. Stupid decision. The next morning I woke up and the computer was off. Normally its just asleep. But I brushed past it and hit the power button. It didn't work so I pressed it again. No sign of turning on. This is when I start panicking. I hold the button down for about ten seconds. NOTHING. I burned out the 1000 dollar computer. I knew we couldn't buy another one, and we didn't have a spare either. I was in deep doo doo. I was full on panicking at this point. I had no idea what to do. I remember leaving the Wii on overnight and that they would burn out and never turn on again. Then all of a sudden, I remembered one time at a dentist office, the x ray machine wasnt functioning. She unplugged and plugged it back in and said "That's what you do when something doesn't work, am I right". So I immediately flip the the pc around and look for the correct plug. There were several random wires plugged in. So I start pulling plugs and putting them back. Finally the last one. I pray this works. I plug it in and put it back. I swear this is like the movies. I plug it in and nothing. I lay on the ground and then hear a beeping sound. Oh my god it worked. So I get up press the power button and it turns on. I couldnt believe it actually worked. Thank you dentist if you see this. None of my family knows and I'm sure none of them ever will.

Janice dipped her hand into the lukewarm water of the bathtub. Just right. Not too hot, not too cold. Water was still flowing from the faucet, and she squeezed bubble bath directly into the stream for maximum bubbling. She stirred the water and smiled as she enjoyed the fragrance. It was the scent of bubble gum (what else?) and the twins enjoyed it.  Kathy and Kevin were four years old, and they loved bath-time. Both were fair-haired blondes with royal-blue eyes, and they were the joy of her life. They�d been premature at birth, and they�d both suffered from just about every preemie illness on the books. Jaundice, pneumonia and anemia had threatened to snuff out their fragile little lives before they�d begun, but the twins were fighters, and had proven the medical staff wrong time and time again.Kathy was the firstborn of the twins, and when she entered the world, she did so kicking and screaming. She was a tough, loud daredevil that rarely took �no� for an answer. She was rather fond of jumping; anywhere and everywhere.  It had started simple at first: Jumping on Janice�s queen-sized bed while attempting to touch the ceiling. Jumping from the couch, the toy chest, and from the third, then fourth, and recently, the fifth step of the stairs. Janice once walked in to the living room and found her brave little girl squatting on top of the bookshelf, preparing to leap onto the plush brown sofa below. That one had earned her a time out and no dessert after supper. Yet, she still found opportunities to test her courage and Janice�s sanity.Kevin, on the other hand, was timid, quiet and reserved. He spoke in a somber and almost melodramatic tone that was often difficult to hear over his sister�s boisterous yelling and shouting. He loved to read, and was already well beyond his peers. Janice made two trips to the local library every week just to keep his appetite for books satisfied. He also enjoyed drawing, and if he didn�t have his nose in a book, he could usually be found contentedly sketching dinosaurs at the kitchen table. The refrigerator was covered in his masterpieces, and Janice found it cute that he�d named every one. Her personal favorite was *Pterodactyl Pineapples*. (Apparently, pterodactyls used pineapples as grenades, dropping them on the heads of any Tyrannosaurs in the area.)Although he�d been potty-trained at the same time as Kathy, he had routinely wet the bed several times a week. About four months ago his accidents had abruptly ended, much to his own relief and to Janice�s. They would be starting kindergarten soon, and she was relieved that he�d gotten his bladder under control. As a single working mother, she couldn�t afford to leave work for an accident. The three of them barely survived on her meager income as a paralegal, and missing even a single day of work would be disastrous to her budget.Janice was an unlikely mother. In a perfect world, she could have been a model. Like her children, she was blonde-haired, with smooth flawless skin and gorgeous blue eyes. From junior high and up until her pregnancy, she was the envy of every girl in school, and the dream of every boy. When she�d gotten pregnant at sixteen, her parents had all but disowned her, the boyfriend had abandoned her, and she suddenly found herself very much grown up. Thankfully, her aunt and uncle had taken her in, but she was forced to drop out of school. The taunting, ridicule, shame and embarrassment had become far too much for her to bear, and her grades suffered because of it. After the twins were born, her aunt insisted that she finish school and go on to college.  By the time the twins were nearly two years old, she�d obtained her general equivalency diploma, and  began to pursue her dream to become a lawyer. She craved her independence, and despised relying on her family for everything, so when a position opened up at a local law firm, she took it. She worked during the day, and studied at night. As a paralegal, she was getting valuable hands-on experience that would serve her well in the future, but the paycheck sucked.Janice was a devoted and attentive mother, and she did the best she could. Although money was tight, every weekend she would take the twins to McDonald�s. They were much too young to understand why she didn�t order anything for herself. After their lunch, they would visit the local flea market. She gave each of them a single dollar bill, and they could spend it however they wanted. Kevin would almost always spend his dollar on books or crayons or similar items, but Kathy was unpredictable. She had once bought a fishing lure, and on another occasion an 80�s disco exercise video. Her latest purchase was a rubber duck.Janice was apprehensive when Kathy pointed at the faded and grimy yellow duck. She tried to convince her stubborn daughter that it was old and gross, but Kathy wouldn�t hear it. She was enamored with the duck and had to have it. To prevent a legendary tantrum of epic proportions, Janice acquiesced on the condition that Kathy allow her to sanitize it. Kathy agreed, the rubber duck was baptized in Purel, and her daughter was happy and that�s what was important.Now, as Janice filled the bath for her kids, she picked up the duck and grinned. She couldn�t quite understand what her daughter found so special about it. Even after she�d scrubbed it with rubbing alcohol, it still bore evidence of its previous owner. The words "bath poem" were still prominent on the bottom of the duck, having been scribbled in permanent marker some time before. *What the fuck is a bath poem?* she wondered. The paint on his left eye was worn almost completely away, his beak appeared to be slightly melted (*who the hell would do such a thing and why?*) which made it appear somewhat lopsided, and someone had added a funny little moustache in the same black ink as well. What she didn�t like most about that rubber duck was his mischievous shit-eating grin. She knew she was being silly, but that goddamned duck looked creepy as hell. Sinister, even.Janice tossed the duck into the swirling water and told the kids it was bath-time. They came running from the living-room where a re-run of *Rugrats* had been playing. Janice had to remind Kathy for the millionth time not to jump into the water, and she had to gently pry a library book from Kevin�s grubby little hands. Once they were in the tub, she quickly shampooed their hair and then left them to play in the tepid water for a little while. This moment was one of the few in her day where she could sit in front of the television in relative silence and enjoy a cranberry vodka or two. It was her only treat to herself, and she was (usually) very sparing with the vodka.  The twins were old enough that they didn�t need to be directly supervised in the tub anymore. Although Janice was partially tuned into a new episode of *Family Guy,* her motherly radar was active. For a little while, at least.This particular day was a Friday. Payday. After work, she�d picked the twins up from daycare and stopped by the bank to deposit her check.  She pulled up to the drive-through window, exchanged the usual formalities with the flamboyant red-headed teller and plucked the envelope containing her check from her battered pleather purse. When she opened the envelope she tweezed her fingers inside to pull out the check and was surprised to find two additional items. A one-hundred dollar bill, and a post-it note that read:*Janice,**You�re doing a* *wonderful* *job and I notice! You deserve this! Get a sitter, and go out for a drink, or order a pizza and share with the kids! Either way, enjoy yourself, and have a great weekend! -Barbara*Janice�s eyes welled up with tears as she read the neat cursive handwriting of her boss. Barbara was a beast in the courtroom but she had a heart of gold. Janice read the note three more times before she finally realized the teller�s voice had been calling to her through the tinny, crackling speaker.�Janice, are you making a deposit today?�She began to speak, and hesitated. When was the last time she had seen a one-hundred dollar bill? Hell, when was the last time she had *held* a one-hundred dollar bill? She couldn�t remember. So many thoughts were whirling around in her head that it became difficult to focus on any one thing. Her mind was rapidly considering all of the things that she could do with that extra money, and after another moment�s hesitation she quickly made a decision.�Sorry, Leo. I was just a little confused. Give me a second.� She reached out the window and grasped the little tube. She opened it up, deposited the check and the bill, and sent it on to Leo.He opened the tube, and seeing the contents, asked Janice what he should do with it. Janice was no fool. Money didn�t grow on trees and she wasn�t about to waste such a wonderful and much-needed gift.�Leo, deposit the check and fifty dollars of that hundred. Okay?"  �You got it, Jan.�She�d ultimately decided that it made sense to save half, and to enjoy half. Hadn�t Barb even said so on the post-it note? �*You deserve this! Enjoy yourself!�  -* and more importantly -  �*...share with the kids!�*On the way home she made two additional stops: McDonald�s, and the liquor store. When they returned home, the twins were ecstatic with their Happy Meals, and she relished every bite of her own Quarter Pounder. She washed it down with vodka and a splash of cranberry juice. Why not? It was Friday, she was celebrating in her own special way, and she fucking deserved it!Over the next few hours, she began to gradually increase the amount of vodka in her glass. She wasn�t the kind of person that drank to get drunk, but tonight she fully intended to do so. She wanted to wait until after the twins were safely tucked into bed before she did, but that�s not what happened at all. Janice wasn�t quite sure when she passed out, but when she came to, she was almost immediately sobered by the overwhelming and deafening sound of utter silence in the apartment. She looked around herself, and noticed that the entire bottle of vodka lay empty on the coffee table. *Did I drink all of it?* She wondered. Well, of course she had. Who else could have drank it? The television was off, so she must have tucked the kids into bed already. But she didn�t remember doing that. Hell, she couldn�t remember anything. She snatched her phone from the end-table and was shocked to discover that it was nearly three o�clock in the morning.She peeled herself from the couch and wobbled towards her children�s bedroom. As she passed the bathroom, the dim *Cookie Monster* night-light cast an eerie, shape-shifting shadow into the hall. Out of the corner of her eye, she thought that something inside looked weird and unfamiliar. She stopped and turned around, and as she entered the bathroom she reached around the wall and fumbled with the familiar switch that would bring the overhead lights in the bathroom to life.As the fluorescent bulbs flickered and buzzed reluctantly, she stood in the doorway casting a quivering silhouette behind her. She was literally overcome with paralysis, shock, and sheer horror.Blood dripped from the ceiling. It ran down the walls. It was matted into the silky blond hair of her precious little angels. Their blue eyes had been gouged out and were now bobbing in the murky, red, bubble-gum scented water. She took a single step towards the tub and her foot came down on a handful of teeth. Ropy blue intestines were draped along the shower curtain rod, swollen with the remains of cheeseburgers and french-fries.  Janice couldn�t tell where Kathy ended and Kevin began. Their bodies were so mangled and torn, that it appeared they�d been almost flattened somehow. Fragments of bone and gelatinous brain matter speckled the mirror and the vanity. A severed foot had been tossed thoughtlessly into the toilet bowl, the red blood and blue cleanser pod creating an almost inky-black porridge.And on the edge of the tub sat that shit-eating rubber duck, grinning at her. There wasn�t a single speck of blood on him.

Martina sat down near the waterfall. This was her place of choice when her problems came knocking on the door. The sound of the water blocked her negative thoughts, made her feel at peace.In her purse was a tool of last resort. That�s how she always labeled it in her mind. When things get too tough for her to handle. When the waterfall ceased to stand guard in front of her sadness, her purse would have the solution.Sci-Fi novels were her go-to books for reading. Delving into another writer�s world felt far safer than remaining in her own. Getting lost in a character�s troubles made her almost forget hers. The more complex the plot, the further she got into the story the more detached from reality she became. The sudden death of her mother being silenced by the writer�s words.She didn�t want the novel to end. Didn�t want to go back living the story she was written into. That�s why for the past few weeks she started reading more and more every evening. Reading her life away.There comes a point in someone�s life when they learn to see through their imaginary walls. Their own magic tricks cease to remain believable. This was the case for Martina. For a while the walls she conjured kept her hidden and safe. Nothing could hurt her anymore. When the time came and she could see through those walls, she would turn to her purse as her mother�s last words echoed in her head. No fictional world could silence those words. Her purse didn�t have any magic tricks though; it held within it the remnants of reality she once stored away.No matter how long the novels were, she knew they would eventually come to an end. The ending of words. Her own novel � no matter how many pages she wrote � was getting close to its end. Before that, a few lines of self-reflection, lines of regret, of pain the world could never understand, were penned down. Pulling the trigger was the final sentence she would ever write in her own words.The waterfall � loud and calm all at once � almost stopped flowing for a second. Wondering why the heartbeats it was accustomed to, had suddenly stopped. It would go on yearning for them for a really long time.

My grandmother was in hospital dying of COPD. For anyone who doesn�t know this is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. It means you have extreme difficulty breathing. She was on palliative care in a coma and we all knew she was going. We had all signed a Do Not Resuscitate order because had she been brought back she would just have no quality of life whatsoever. It was time. She went into respiratory arrest at some point in the night when there were no family members at the hospital and only a junior doctor on the ward, or at least the nearest person when she coded. The junior doctor panicked and resuscitated her. I don�t know whether she didn�t see it, although it was written in big letters above the bed, DNR or what happened. It took a long time to bring her back, and her brain was starved of oxygen. She was brain damaged and was left with limited brain function. The hospital at this point removed all assistance from her, breathing support etc so she would die. To be fair, they did carry on with the pain relief. It took her 24 hours to die, chest rising up with every breath convulsing, making a terrible gasping noise. She was unconscious but her body was involuntarily spasming trying to breathe. Eventually brown gunk started coming out of her nose as she got closer to death. We took it in turns to gently wipe it away so she had at least a bit of dignity in death. The only thing I can compare it to was catching a fish and leaving it on the bank to flip around and die for 24 hours. Despite the reassurance that she couldn�t feel anything and was brain dead it was extremely distressing to watch. After she�d passed and was buried my dad began the process of filing a lawsuit against the hospital, but thankfully I managed to persuade him not to. We live in England and we are extremely lucky to have free healthcare for everyone from the National Health Service and all the wonderful doctors. That junior doctor did something legally wrong. She made a mistake, everybody does, but it was legally wrong. She did not however, do anything medically wrong in my opinion. She is to be commended for rushing to aid and successfully resuscitating a patient. I didn�t want anything to put this young doctors career in jeopardy. Maybe I was right maybe I was wrong, there�s not really a moral to the story. It was 5 years ago and I felt like writing it down today for some reason.

So when i was starting first year on college, our teacher wanted to take us to another city, so we could learn about the architecture. I just wanted to go so i could spend time with my long distance girlfriend that lives on that city, so when the night came, the teachers let the class go to eat, and we went to a bar.Some of my classmates drank a lot, i didn't because i was going to see my girl.Then we went to the downtown with the teachers, and they gave us an hour so we couls have some fun, explore and be turists. And some guy in my class found a bar...Not just a bar, a super sketchy bar that has the sliding thing on the door, and they made us get in only 3 at the same time, some guys drank a lot again, by them, 30% of the class was drunk.The teachers didnt noticed, and we went back to the hotel, i didnt ended up going with my girlfriend because of the teachers, they said to the administration that if they catch us outside they have to tell them and we could get expelled.So sadMy friend and i, decided to go to our friends room, but they were drinking a ton, we didnt even knew how they got the booze. We left, it looked like it was going to be a trainwreck.... It wasThis guy that was the teachers pet, got reay drunk and hired a prostitute, he escaped and his room mate was told we has going to get killed, so he ram away, the prostitute came to the administration telling she wanted to be paid, so they talked with the teachers, they went on a manhunt all over the hotel, they found guys smoking pot, having sex, drunk, etc.The next morning it was akward as hell, everyone knew what happened, no one was expelled because the teachers could get in trouble for not doing their job, so until this day, no one in my college outside my class, knows about this.Oh, and the guy that hired the prostitute got an STD.Btw sorry about my English, Spanish redditor here

I�ve used to be on tinder all the time, and had fairly good success on there. But one girl was different. When I say different, I mean this, I know a lot of people don�t put their Real names on their social media�s , and I totally understand that. Hers were always some anime character name or something and never really posted much. She told me some disturbing things about her past , after spending a night together. And there�s wasn�t a way to confirm if she was telling the truth , but I had no reason to believe she was lying. She spent like a month or two at my house , my mom liked her , but my mom also knew something was off about this girl. She had to go back to the city she was from because of something ( it�s been a couple years so I forgot the particular reason ) and we kinda just lost contact. Before you say oh she just stopped liking you or whatever, let me add some more knowledge. She probably had like 4 different Facebook in the span of like 4 months , because she would always forget you passwords and would use it more for just memes rather then talking to people. She didn�t have her ID with her either, not sure if it was because she didn�t have a car or because just never got one. Her being a runaway wouldn�t surprise me too. She didn�t have phone service just used WiFi to communicate with people. She did contact me a couple times when she went back to her town, with a black eye she said she got in a fight but just the way she was at my house , her getting into a fight didn�t make sense . Lots of other weird things tooSometimes I wonder if maybe she got into a bad situation. Sometimes I wonder what she�s up too. Sometimes I wonder what was real and what was lies she told me. Anyways I don�t need to find her, I hope she�s okay. Anyone else ever deal with something like that?

My fianc� says I eat like a pregnant lady. I eat my ramen noodles without cooking them. I love the hard crunchiness of the raw uncooked noodle squares. I love my black coffee lukewarm. love cold pizza, cold spaghetti, cold lasagna, basically cold everything. I love peanut butter and pickle sandwiches. I love French fries when they are soggy. I like my bacon burnt. I prefer to dip my Oreos in water rather than milk. I once ordered a hot dog at a gas station with all 27 condiments on top. I ate it and it was delicious. I eat hummus out of the jar and put peanut butter on literally everything. Peanut butter pizza, peanut butter on my cake, peanut butter mixed with mashed potatoes, etc. I like my steak well done to the point where I can chew it like rubber. Fight me Reddit lol.

I just watched my cousin get married last weekend to a woman he has known since before high school. All of us truly believe they are soulmates. They started dating in high school and like all teenage romance, it was rocky sometimes. They would break up and get back together. Sometimes they wouldn�t talk for months. She cried, he cried. He broke, she broke. But they never cut each other off completely, they couldn�t. The summer after their junior year (let�s say Christine) had to move. My cousin (let�s say Drew) was devastated. They still kept in touch, they�d hang during breaks and he even flew out to take her to her senior prom and her to his. Eventually they both graduated and ended up at the same college in both Christine and Drew�s home state. They got back together but this time was different.  They were more mature, and so were their friends. There was no �block her! She�s crazy!� Nonsense when something went wrong. Their friends saw how happy they were when in each other�s presence, that they were both healthy for each other, therefore they added some help in there too. They still had their ups and downs but their relationship continued and ta-da! Now they are married! I�ve never seen the two of them so happy. My intention in telling this story is to hopefully make some of you smile and maybe restore a little more of your hope and faith in things. Happy redditing!

I posted this on a few other subreddits, but I think people here might like it.  This is a TRUE story. This happened to me.Characters:Me: me (duh)I am a 13 year old girl. Pretty light (important for the story)Neckbeard: NBAn 18 year old Neckbeard that KNOWS IM 13 YEARS OLD!!!!(this is also important)Neckbeards kind brother: KBSorry if this post is confusing, roughly each paragraph is going to be a different thing NB did. I�m writing this at 1 in the morning and I�m tired so bear with me. And I�m going to start with the less extreme things, then move on the illegal things.This started when I went to visit my grandparents on my mom�s side of the family during summer. It was far so we took a plane to get there and my dad did not come. While we were there; we went to visit my mom�s cousin for two days. We were staying at their house for the entirety of the two days. Moms cousin has two sons. The NB and his kind brother. The brother was very nice. He respected my personal space, he changed clothing every day, he worked two jobs and was over all a great person to be around. On the other hand, there was NB. He wore the exact same clothing the entire time I was there. Which was about three days, and two nights. He had a neckbeard that looked like someone glued pubes onto his face. He smelled bad, and I never saw him take a shower. He was also unemployed. He was creepy. At first, it was �ok�, but after some time he went too far. Throughout the whole time, he was making horrible jokes (and that�s a lot coming from me. I have a horrible sense of humor) about the holocaust, Nazis, Hitler and those subjects. He also would not stop talking about anime. I watched one anime at the time. He would suggest ones, then immediately give me reasons not to.For example:NB: You should watch this anime that I saw called \*insert name of anime\*Me: Ok. Ill check it out.NB: Wait, you might not like it. There are lots of people getting rapped in it. There are pretty graphic scenes.He did these multiple times. Another thing was my anime pencil box that I adore. I decided to show it to him and the FIRST this he said was �\*anime character on box\* is hot�. In my head I was like �wtf. This is a 15-year-old boy. Dude, you ruined my favorite pencil box.� He would also talk like this about other anime characters.He would also constantly brag about how good he was at fighting. He told me about the time that he punched a hole in the wall at school, and that he wanted to �beat a kid�s brain out� I quote. He would also tell me about how he physically fought with his brother and how he wanted to fight with me. He was insisting that he teach me how to fight and I reluctantly agreed. He was teaching me how to trip someone by hitting the back of their knee. While he was showing me how, he had his hands on my shoulder to prevent me from falling, but when I did fall, he moved his hands to my upper arm and waist. I was uncomfortable. I ended up making an excuse that I needed to go to the bathroom and left. He also said that when he gets mad, all he sees is red. To say the least, I was scared of him. He was literally twice my weight, at least a head taller than me, and had a much larger body build that me. This is why I never called him out. I was scared he would get mad and hurt me.Another thing he would brag about was his HORRIBLE sleeping schedule, even compared to me. He would always say my bed time is sooo early (it�s at 10pm, or 22:00) and that I should stay up with him. He bragged about how he went to bed at 9 in the MORNING and woke up at 2pm or 14:00. DUDE WTF. I was with you eating breakfast. You�re not asleep.He also told me about how he called me cute if front of his friends, and they called him a pedo(not as a joke) and he was LAUGHING wile telling me this. He also kept on calling me cute for the rest of my stay there which made me really uncomfortable. On the first night there, we were eating dinner at the table, and he looked at my plate (which had a decent amount of food on it) before saying �You don�t eat a lot. No wonder you�re so slim�. I wish I was joking, he actually said that and I was creeped the F\*CK out. For most of these comments I just replied with �oh� and switched the subject to try and hint at him that I was uncomfortable, but did he pick up on these signals? NO! He would also say I could sleep on his shoulder if I wanted to during the car rides (hell no).I was lying on my bed when their cat jumped next to me. The neckbeard, who was standing there having a one-sided conversation with me, leaned OVER me to pet the cat. One hand was petting the cat, while the other was supporting him up, and one of his knees was placed on the edge of the bed. The hand that was supporting him was placed uncomfortably close, nearly toughing, my pelvis while the knee was on the other side of my pelvis. I was freaking out. I was stuck on the bed with a neckbeard hovering over me.NB would also follow me everywhere. When we were outside, he would walk next to me, when I was sitting, he would sit next to me. When I went to my bedroom, he would follow me in and stand at the doorway as I lay on the bed and stare at me. When I went to the bathroom, he would stand next to the door!Later on, NB looked at his phone and laughed. I looked at him and he noticed. He said it was a meme but he did not think I would find it funny. I told him to show me as I have a horrible sense of humor. BIG MISTAKE!! He showed me something similar to this:&#x200B;[Reminder: I am 13 years old at the time. He knows this!](https://preview.redd.it/isksfnmstho31.png?width=194&format=png&auto=webp&s=90244f537cb19dd1f0dfa24ec98b480eda05c84f)I decide to ignore it and hope it doesn�t happen again. He showed me a few more inappropriate memes but I ignored all of them. But that wasn�t all that he did. He decided to make me listen to a five to ten-second-long HENTI audio of a girl being raped. I was shook. He then decided to tell me about a group chat that he had with his friends where they sent each other henti audios and clips. He then proceeded to ASK ME IF I WANT TO JOIN!!! Wtf dude. NO I don�t want to join your henti group chat. That�s disgusting. After I declined, he then told me about his favorite type of henti. Girls with tentacles. Its were a girl is captured in a bunch of tentacle like things, and then�the henti part. NB started to explain to me what tentacles (in henti) means and how it became a thing. He went into detail.By this time, our stay was over. All this happened in two days. The last thing he did in person, was when we had to say goodbye, he hugged me really tight and pushed me onto the couch that was behind me, before falling on top of me. I managed to get out from under him quickly. Now you think this is the end, nope. There is more.My mom gave him my phone number. The first thing he sent me was a meme saying: all you need in life is boobs. I decided to ignore that and sent him a bunch of gif�s from an anime (the same one that was on the pencil box). He replied to one of the gifs of a 15 year old boy crying saying, and I kid you not �I�m going to have sexual thoughts about that� I was grossed out. It�s a gif a kid you pedo!! Why would you say that!!The last thing he sent me was the worst. He made a bunch of stickers (the texting platform we use allows you to make mini photos that they call stickers) where he took animals and replaced their bodies and heads with a penis. He sent me one of a pig where its entire body was changed. He told me it was his penis. I stopped responding after that. I was afraid to block him because he would probably tell my mom and that would force me to show her everything, and I don�t have the guts to do that. He called me about 10 times after that before giving up. I don�t know what to do now. Should I tell someone? If yes, who?

So before I get into this story I have to get some background info out of the way. I assume most of you know what Kill La Kill is. If you don't it's an anime and manga with tons of revealing images. Now with that out of the way I can start.At our school library there's a manga section. And somehow there was Kill La Kill there. Me and a few friends who knew what it was had been joking about it. Not a lot of many people knew about it. Now cut to today. During my lunch my friend went to get a book out of there. I decided to tag along with him. Our school has three parts. The elementary, middle, and high school. While we were in there one of the elementary classes came inside to do their reading special. One kid is looking at books and finds Kill La Kill. I rushed over and told him not to read it. I pulled the teacher and explained what Kill La Kill is. Now it's gone.You may be wondering how it got there. I don't know. But my guess is it was a donation. Few years ago campus was another school. Once we moved there they donated the books. Someone must of got Kill La Kill in there. Now I wonder how many elementary students found Kill La Kill. We probably should of reported it earlier but as dumb teens we just laughed at it.  Rest in peace the innocence of any kids who read it before we reported it.

The year was 1947, two years after the Second Great War, or also known as World War 2 in today's times, I was but a boy, ravaged in the after-effects of a bloody war. My father had passed in October of 1944 when my family and I were placed in a Japanese internment camp. He was strict with us, but it was because of this reason that we were well mannered. I never recall seeing any emotion from him to indicate his love for us, but my mother always said we were the joy of his life. My brother and I lived fatherless and in the slums of Brooklyn with a radio for our only entertainment. The New York Yankees had just won the World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers, and the streets of Brooklyn were livid with drunks due to the loss. My brother and I, who had followed that season closely as an escape from reality, were devastated. Still heartbroken from the loss of our father, our spirits were crushed by the loss of the Dodgers. Baseball was all we had.We were poor with only one income coming from our mother who worked two jobs. Our grandmother and grandfather, who had lived with us until their deaths back to back in 1956, were too old and brittle to work long hours in a factory. Since we were poor, my brother and I walked to school to save money. Every day on our way to school, we would pick up rocks and hit them with sticks pretending we were Jackie Robinson, pointing to the sky and hitting a home run for a grand slam. As being the few Asian kids in our class, we were made fun of for our eyes and skin color by a group of kids with the ringleader being Tony Graham, an intolerable excuse for an offspring. For ten years straight, Tony began to move from childish insults and pranks to violent acts of racism. One day coming home from school, Tony followed us as if he were a lion hiding in the tall grass, waiting for his chance to attack. As we turned down an alley to take a shortcut home, Tony was in front of us holding a bat. We tried to turn back but shortly was cornered by Tony and his friends. He beat us to a pulp screaming, �You damn Japs�!� and other racial slurs. Barely conscious, I saw them run away as I checked on my brother. He was dead. My brother who was named after our father was dead. The only memory left of my father was dead beside me.Twenty years later, on the anniversary of my brother�s death, I drowned my sorrow in alcohol at the local bar. At the age of 38, I had graduated from New York Medical College with a degree in medicine and found myself working as a doctor in a local clinic. While at the bar, I saw a familiar face� a face I could never forget. I picked my beer up and sat next to the man and ordered 2 shots of vodka. I introduced myself as David from high school, giving the man a fake identity to mask the anger building inside of me. The rest of the night, we drank and laughed, obviously he didn't know who I was, but he would not turn away a free drink. After spending two hours talking, I convinced the man to come back to my apartment where the party could continue with the promise of drugs. He was addicted to cocaine and meth, so he jumped at the idea of coming home with me. As we walked through the door, he asked, �Where's the coke ma-� and with a swift movement, I knocked him out with the same bat used to kill my sibling.Years prior Tony killed my brother with a bat and ran off, but he made a grave mistake and dropped the bat. That bat became my vow to avenge my brother�s death, but I didn't stop there. I dragged the man to my room and tied him to my bedpost. While he was unconscious, I opened his mouth, grabbed his tongue, and woke him up to the severing of his tongue. As he struggled to set himself free, I bashed his face in with the bat until I couldn't recognize him. I fed the tongue to my dog and wrapped the man up in my comforter. I then put him in the trunk of my car and drove sixty miles to bury the body in the middle of the woods. This man was not Tony, but a friend of Tony's. An accomplice to the murder of my brother. Tony died five years prior when I splattered his brains across the pavement in a dark alley in Brooklyn. Murder here is easy.

Before I begin, I am in an apartment with room mates. I was casually studying in my room one night and all of a sudden, I heard screaming from outside my door and it goes dead silent right after. I go back to work thinking they are just f\*cking around. Then I hear three small knocks on my door. I then casually get up to answer, I open it and my room mate looks at me and tells me," hey, could you look up red vomit on your laptop, im too high rn" I am so confused and I ask what happened. Apparently one of his friends ate hella red hot cheetos and drank too much so the guy vomited vibrant red liquid all over his bed. Moral of the story: Dont eat spicy sh\*t before drinking   If my roommate reads this, sup

I�ve heard that you should never make the same mistake twice, however I�ve made the same mistake about 7,000 consecutive times now. My mistake is that I wake up everyday. Now I�m just fuckin� around, but there are quite a few days where I really shouldn�t have left my bed.One such day was when I tattooed a girl.   In case you�re unaware, tattooing requires that one be at least halfway decent at drawing, which I am not. You could give me a ruler and I�ll draw you a fuckin circle. Any who, a few years back, I was interested in this girl, and she was interested in me, so she decided she wanted me to give her a tattoo. I immediately told her that it was a bad idea. Her friends told her it was a bad idea. It was a bad idea. She didn�t listen.That Saturday she picked me up and I once again told her, �This is a bad idea�, but she didn�t listen, and a teenage boy with the ol� horn wasn�t about to disappoint a pretty girl. We get to her house and head down the basement, and the shitshow began.She shows me a nice picture she drew of a moon and some stars that she had drawn, I figured it was simple enough for me to draw so I decided, �Fuck it alright!�. I was wrong.One of the first steps in getting tattooed is having a stencil put on your body that the artist traces ultimately resulting in a tattoo. This seemed simple enough so we attempted to put one on her thigh. We fucked that up.Somehow this girl decides it�ll be a good idea for me to just do it freehand. At this point we�re at the Rubicon and I�m telling Caesar not to cross the river. Caesar doesn�t listen.I dip the homemade tattoo gun in some India ink and start goin at her thigh. The excess ink gets all over the area I�m supposed to be tattooing, blocking my vision, but I keep on truckin�.At this point the girl realizes the folly of her ways and says and I quote � That�s enough, you�re all over the place.�  I grab a paper towel and wipe away the ink, revealing my masterpiece. �Thats no moon.�There on this girl�s thigh was 75% of what can only be described as a macaroni noodle. I walked home that night and we haven�t spoken in a few years.

My neighbor is Jim. 60's, average guy. Decent enough. Jim is colorblind...cant see colors only shades of grey. Yesterday i saw him out in his garden walking around wearing shades and acting weird. Went out to the fence and asked if he was ok. He was wiping tears from his eyes and had trouble speaking for a bit. Growing more concerned i again asked if he was ok. After a few moments he removed his shades and showed them to me. He explained that they were those new kind of glasses that allowed colorblind people to see colors. Aaahhhh, of course. He explained that he was simply overcome by the beauty of everything he was seeing. This was a guy that kept a manicured yard and flower garden every year, without ever knowing what the colors actually looked like.    Think about it. Jim went most of his life without knowing vibrant oranges or reds...soothing blues or lavenders, the many shades and textures of greens and yellows. Im glad Jim got to experience these things in his life. The more i thought about it the more i could see a lesson in this. You see, most of us go through our lives only appreciating the beauty of what we are able or willing to see. Increase that willingness or ability, and whole new worlds are opened up for us to experience and enjoy. I think im going to work on finding the hidden beauty in the world around now...in peoples smiles, their hearts and personalities, in the spirit of love that God has given each and every person born. Im going in search of those things that make me stop and say 'wow, i never knew' .

In middle school, my wood shop teacher had a surgery and he was out for what seemed like the entire year, but probably a month or so. So, normally, when you have a substitute teacher, at least when I was in school, that meant you can just goof off for that period. Most subs just sit there and make sure the students don�t kill each other.  So, while the real teacher was recovering from his surgery, wood shop class became an hour of 7th graders just messing around, laughing, yelling, and not learning anything about wood working. Well, one day, for whatever reason, everyone in class was actually behaving. No one was goofing off, no paper planes being tossed, everyone was just sitting there. Some reading, some doodling, some even sleeping, but it was very quiet. I remember the substitute teacher sitting with his feet up on the table just day dreaming. (Obviously this was a time before smart phones). No buffoonery at all, just a class full of bored 7th graders. Suddenly, the TV in the front of the class turns on, and on screen is some hard core porn video. The volume was on high, the moaning and screaming was to the max, and hard core porn video just blaring. Everyone in class breaks out laughing, the sub nearly broke his neck trying to get to the TV to shut it off. About 10 seconds of raging boner in vagina porn going off in front of a class full of 7th graders. Still one of the funniest things I�ve ever witnessed. The teacher ejects the tape out of the VCR and begins yelling at the class. �WHO DID THIS? YOU BETTER SPEAK UP NOW�. Obviously, no one confessed and everyone laughed and laughed and laughed. Now, i considered myself to be one of the jokers in class, part of the �in� crowd, and at times, the class clown. But till this day, I don�t know who actually set that prank up. No one has ever said �yo, crazyface, that was me�. I�m assuming it was some funny guy, who put that video in before class, and had the remote in his bag or something, and turned the TV on. This was the mid 90s, and those watches that can become TV remotes were new and I heard some kids had them. It was probably one of those kids, but they were too afraid to confess, even to other students. But I also think it�s possible the teacher was watching porn when no one was there, and someone turned the TV on and got lucky. Whatever the case, I will never forget the day hard core porn randomly started playing in my 7th grade wood shop class.

This happend a while ago but I'll try my best to explain it. I watch alot of ask reddit videos because it provides background noise when I play games, the thread the video was on was something along the lines "what are some actual life tips" or something like that, remember this for later in the story. Fast forward a few days later a got into a little argument with my family and went for a bike ride and I have a little trail that I like to ride sometimes, about a fifteen minute ride to get there. I got there and there is a bridge over a lake a few minutes into the trail so I decided to stop and look at the lake and relax. Not even a minute later a man in a long dark green coat and black pants walked on to the bridge from the other side, as soon as he seen me me started to pick up the pace until he realized I knew he was there, after that he slowed down, the conversation went something like this:Me: excuse me, are you ok?Man: do you happen to have a lighter on you?Me: nah man, sorry about that.Man: do you know what time it is?Going back to the Theead I remember someone said that If someone "shady" asked for the time you should bring your watch/phone up so you have the person in your sight of view, keep in mind that all that's separating me and him is a racing bike. I did what the user said and he started to walk away. As soon as I looked away the man did a full 180 and was speed walking towards me again. I hopped on my bike and booked it.TL:DR an r/askreddit thread saved me from getting robbed.

We were all in the same class. Sixth grade. My mom drove us to the house. On the way there we picked up my friend, Ronny. The party was for Ronny's cousin, Jon.  As we approached the house in the dull green Volkswagen, I remember him tapping my shoulder and whispering "You didn't tell me your mom was a *fox*" My mom heard what he said and laughed a little. I just shrugged my shoulders. I had never thought about it really.  "I will be back at nine to pick you up" she said as I folded the seat forward to let Ron out. The tires crackled a little on the dirt driveway as she pulled away. The dust. I can still taste it. The house was surrounded by Orange trees. Now it's just sleek signs and shiny cars, not a tree in sight.   It was your typical birthday party I suppose. Pizza. Cake. Ice Cream. The usual stuff. We were a little too old for "Pin the tail on the donkey", though we might have played just the same. I can't recall if we sang *Happy Birthday*, but I'm sure we did.  Truthfully, I only remember the game.I'm not even sure how it began. I noticed at some point the entire room had grown quiet. Two people had come out of the kitchen, in what I suppose could be called a two person Conga line.  Jon, the birthday boy, was in front, with a girl behind him. They went around the room once and when they stopped, she tapped a boy, (Ronny of course), who then joined them, and the "train" went through the swinging door, into the kitchen. A half a minute later  - out they came - looped around the room again, and stopped. Ronny chose a girl, and back to the kitchen they went. Now the room was noticeably silent, as we waited to see who was next, and wondered what was in the kitchen. The process continued, boy, girl, boy, girl, until there was only one boy left - that was me - but I wasn't to concerned, because Dawna, the last girl to be picked, was very popular and pretty imo. And now she had no choice but to pick me. I forgot to mention that the "train" was gone for ever increasing intervals each time it left the room. So soon I was allowed to join the train and we all scooted back to the kitchen, where the line abruptly stopped. Finally, I would be let in on the big secret. That's when I noticed that Jon had turned around to kiss the girl behind him. She then turned around and kissed Ronny, who was behind her. I suppose there were maybe 7 girls and 8 boys present, so it wasn't long before I would get my (first ever) kiss. My heart raced as my turn approached. Just then Dawna turned around and SMACK! slapped me across my face.I was stunned for a moment, not fully comprehending what had happened. Everyone giggled and laughed for a few seconds. The game had ended. I don't remember being embarrassed or hurt at the time. I may have even been relieved - I didn't have to choose a girl to slap or kiss.  Years later, I was trying to sleep, trying to figure out why I seemed to always be alone, when this game we played, this "kissing" game, fell out of a dark corner of my memory. I was laying there thinking "everyone got a kiss but me-Where they all in on it?-Who came up with this mean game?-Why the fuck would anyone play this fucked up game?-I didn't get a kiss!" I could feel my face flush a little as I mulled over it. In the distance I could hear a locomotive's horn up near the remaining groves. A faint taste of "orange tree dust" was on my tongue for a moment. I finally fell asleep.

My senior year my English teacher was an absolute bitch. She was the stereotypical English teacher. Found symbolism in everything, loved old books, hated phones etc. I hated her smug tone she was always right and made us write essays about the symbols in books. I couldn't find anything because I'm a literal person. I like things to be straight forward and simple. She thought I was just being difficult put of spite. I made it clear I hated her. So she told the school that I was sexist. My dad got called in and we sat down trying to find out if I was sexist. Another female teacher said I was her best student and had no problems with me. So then my English teacher claimed it was racism. I looked at her and said "You're white." Apparently she was Korean and I had no idea (She didn't look Korean at all) The school took that as proof it wasn't a race  She looked at me "Well if it's not because I'm a woman or because I'm Korean then what is it?" She gave me a smug look confident that no could hate her unless it was because of prejudice. I looked at the principal and asked to speak freely. "I don't like you as a person. Your pretentious and smug. It has nothing to do your physical appearance. I has to do with your personality."

Bizarre story from someone I will not say, so I�ll call them Z. Z works night shifts at a hospital in a pretty ghetto area. Yesterday night the police brought in this drunk guy who had been DUI. Apparently he drove into a car in a parking lot or something. His neck and back were sore, so they ordered him to get CAT scans done to make sure he was ok. Z said he was nice and cooperative enough despite his drunken state when Z gave him the CAT scans. After that, Z was pushing him on the stretcher to the ER to wait for the results from his CAT scans, but apparently crazy was done. Z says he hops off the stretcher, goes �I�m outta here!�, and despite Z telling him �You don�t wanna do this�,  runs off to no return. He left everything. Wallet, car keys, license etc. Z didn�t chase after him, but told security and the nurses. There is security footage, but the officers didn�t have access to it until their boss came in (not until the next day). Police and security searched the hospital, but they didn�t found him. So basically, there�s a madman on the loose and nobody knows where he is. I�ll update this post when I get more info. *UPDATE!* So they checked the footage and it showed him just running out of the hospital like an absolute lunatic, but they weren�t able to tell which direction he was going after he ran out of the building. Z says he hasn�t heard if he�s returned to get his belongings. Wild!!

My Grandmother told me this last night after I asked her if she knew any of our family history. During World War Two my Great Great Grandmother (We�ll call her �B� for short) was walking behind two SS officers on her way home with a bit of a distance between them. Eventually she caught up enough for the 2 officers to notice her presence, they turned round and demanded that she cross the street and not walk the same path as them (Because she was a women). Now B did not like this one bit. She refused, they continued to demand that she move to the other walk way but she repeatedly said no as to her being a woman was not a good enough reason for her to have to cross the road. Eventually they arrested her and took her to a cell to be held. Luckily for B someone working in the prison recognised her and snuck her out and told her to run and not look back. Had this person not been working that day she would have been sent to a concentration camp. Another aspect of this story lies a few years before with her Husband who was planning on moving the entire family out of Germany just before the war started. He was becoming increasingly nervous about Hitler and wanted his family to have nothing to do with Nazi Germany. Unfortunately, as he was on his way back from South Africa by ship he contracted Malaria and died before he could get them out. B�s daughter (My Great Grandmother) became a translator and met my Great Grandfather and got out of Germany to raise their family in England (I�m unsure if this was during or after the war). It�s a story that is very rarely told but I couldn�t believe all the family history I got in one question.

I was just microwaving something and holding my laptop and put my laptop in the microwave but then I took it out and put the plate in.

My mom left me at petsmart. She left me there to then drive accross the parking lot to Walmart, only to relize she lost her kid a good 15 into shopping at Walmart. So my mother now confused and terrified asks if the Walmart employees would page me on the intercom that could be heard through out the store. Whilst this is happening I relize my mom is no longer at petsmart. So, realizing this, I walk through the car lot to Walmart, remembering mom planned on going there next. Only to walk through the door to hear my name echoing about the store on the intercom. After I finally find my mom pale and worried at the front desk. She then finally sees me and screeched " where in the hell were you?! I've been trying to page you for 20 minutes!". It hits me SHE LEFT ME AT FRIGGIN PETSMART AND DIDN'T NOTICE HER FIRT BORN CHILD WAS GONE UNTIL SHE WAS HALF WAY DONE SHOPPING AT THE GOD FORSAKEN WALMART ACCROSS THE LOT. Needless to say I'm still a bit sour about the whole ordeal.

I just remembered this thing that happened to me like a year ago and made me giggle, so I decided to share it.So like a year ago I moved away from home to a state all by myself, I knew nobody there and my closest relative or friend was a 4hr bus away.I lived 2 streets away from the beach and the place was amazing, the girls were the most beautiful I've ever seen and there was always something to do, but I started to feel lonely and I didn't wanted to sacrifice my freedom doing an activity after work to only maybe meet people I like, so I downloaded I social app I had used years ago, I even met one of my girlfriends there.There I started flirting with a girl that was just amazing, I have always had a very hard time finding someone that likes the stuff that I do, from music to how to spend free time, and I've always been very peaky with girls, so I thought I hit the jackpot.After some time I asked her on a date, and she told me if I was okay with everything on her profile which I found strange, after making a second look I noticed it said she was trans. Just to make a point I've had very few girlfriends because I am really peaky, each gf has been in my eyes the most beautiful girl I've ever dated, I've even ruined a couple of friendships trying something when I just don't feel that way and in the end I just don't want to go on. And with all that said, it hit me for like a big part of the day, but in the end I said fuck it, she was truly a 10/10 in both looks and personality, and I didn't think it was that big of a deal, and I couldn't think of a family member or friend who wouldn't be okay with that, so we put the date for the next day after my work.I waited for an hour and she never arrived, she later apologized, explained whatever had happened and we just said we would see each other next weekend, we kept texting almost every day, but I noticed each new profile pic she uploaded to WhatsApp was a bit different... There's no nice way to say this, but each pic had less Photoshop, my 10/10 became a 9/10, later it had no breast's (I'm okay with that but that's not how she looked at first) to the point that the last pics were not that feminine, and she kept asking from time to time if it was really ok. In the end,the only thing she kept I could remember was the long hair, after some time we just stopped texting.I won't lie I ended up disappointed, and now I know it doesn't take a day to make me open minded... But in the end I'm just glad everything happened the way it did and that only I and maybe a couple of strangers on Reddit know about this.

BlissTo me this word had little meaning just a few months ago. However, after much introspection and being blind-sided by a terrifying ailment. The word Adversity means so much more to me now, than it ever has before. Adversity. To some this word has little meaning, to me is has substantial. The definition of adversity is difficulties or misfortune, reflecting on my life I�ve had a few. I view adversity as yes a difficulty but too as an opportunity to overcome an obstacle that will make you a better, more experienced soul. Advertsity is an important thing in life. With out and we become weak, with it and the traiphum over it and we become stronger versions of ourselfes. The book is written as a memoir, of my life. Today is December, 20th it�s a typical Thursday, on a Typical week. Well for most Americans this may be the case. This week for me has been anything but typical, these past 6 months have been anything but typical. To fully understand where I�m coming from, lets go back to July. This past Spring was like any other spring, I was full of life and teeming with energy, excited for any and all aspects of life. I met a girl, the first week was pure bliss. Not a care in the world and she was perfect. Yet, just a week into getting to know her, I started feeling odd. Nothing specific, but I started feeling different. Not my usual self, more distant, detached from the moment, and unable to recall what I�ve just done or even the day prior. I thought I was just in a bit of a rut, so I thought some extra rest, and veggies would surely kick whatever it was that was kicking me. A week went by... and still no better than (INCLUDE FLYING) the week prior. I was actually worse, now plagued with daily, almost constant headaches. Being the person, I was at the time, I let my ego get in the way. Reassuring myself that, everything was okay, and I wasn�t feeling off. It was all in my head. Until a month went by and I still felt the same, I was not coming out of this fog, this mental clutter was inhibiting my cognition and I was worried given how long this had been pressing on my mind. So as any responsible adult would do, I went to my doctor. My doctor is such a good doctor, a younger attractive kind woman, she heard me out and without hesitation recommended that I go to a neurologist. Which clearly, sent shivers down my spine. I agreed to head to a neurologist, worried yet stoked that hopefully this specialist will reassure me that its just a virus that�s really dragging itself out and I should be better in no time! So I waited, waited for what felt like an entirety. I recall thinking, I wish I could just go to sleep and wake up and it be the appointment date already. This obviously didn�t work. What felt like forever was actually only around a month. But when your world around you is falling apart, it�s easy to overlook the reality of time. The day finally came. My first appointment with a certified brain doctor. I was optimistic. As I pulled into the hospital, it dawned on me what exacty it was that was happening to me. Prior to this point I had lived in an illusion that, this isn�t anything abnormal and everything will be resolved soon. After I parked in the emergency room�s parking lot and walked arcoss the street to the doctors office, my demenor changed. I begain to worry about what exactly this was that was affecting me. I chose not to focus on this and instead shifting my mind to the girl I had started dating, Kendra. This worked momentarily, and before I knew it all the paperwork had been completed and I was sitting in the neurologist�s room awaiting consul. This room was a bit of an unsettling one, there was tacky painting on the walls and a replica of a brain on the table. For a moment I thought it�d be interesting to pick up the brain and play with it, but out of fear that I would become paranoid if I learned the intricates of the mind I elected to not do so. Once the doctor arrived, we exchanged brief pleasantries. He was a quiet guy, for some reason not at all what I had envisioned. He didn�t think it was anything to severe but just to verify and put my mind at ease. He suggested that I go in for a MRI. The MRI took a few days to get scheduled. But once it was scheduled, I was excited to have a glimpse into my brain. I recall the day of my initial MRI like it was just yesterday. I had a ground instruction class that morning, covering complex aviation related information. My instructor asked me if I wished to stay longer and to power through some more material, which I undoubtedly did. But I couldn�t, I told him �I can�t man, I�ve got a MRI to make it to.� He jokingly expressed that it was about time they figure out what was wrong with me, unknowing that I was indeed worried about my condition.  Humor is an effective and common coping mechanism when people are dealing with stressful situations. Once I arrived at the hospital and walked to the receptionist. I was greeted by a pleasant woman. She was young, chipper and attractive. After we briefly exchanged pleasantries and I had filled out the form, I was instructed to await a nurse who would call me back to the MRI room. Once the nurse came, I had changed and was ready to hop in this machine and get this on with. Prior to doing that, she asked if I was okay with the dye they used in the test. I was unaware that the dye was going to be used and she handed me an informational paper on the drug and the facts the FDC, knew about it. After reading this, talking with the nurse about it and contemplating what to do, I elected to deny the dye, and have the procedure done without it. Given the rare potentially risky, side effects of the drug I figured it be best not to move forward with it. Since I elected to reject the dye and the insurance company had only authorized me to have a MRI with the dye, I had to await the insurance approval of a MRI without dye. This took about another week. That week passed. Now to my relief, I was finally all setup to have this MRI done. After an identical introduction to getting to the machine, there I was. Finally standing in front of a huge, intriguing machine. The nurse instructed me to sit on the bed, and wait to be slid in. First, I laid down, then he slid the headphones over my ears, gave me an emergency button to press in case I panic, and finally the cage. The cage is literally a cage they put your head in to prevent it from moving. Fortunately, I�m not claustrophobic, or this would have been pure torture. Once he slid me back into the belly of the machine, the peaceful piano music I had requested began to play. It was rather loud, but that�s what you wanted. You wanted it to be loud enough to drown out the very loud jack-hammering sounds the machine made throughout the thirty-minute procedure. Once the procedure began, I was very mellow about it all. Not that anxious at all. However, after a few minutes into the procedure I begin to feel my heartrate increase. My mind instinctively went to two people. The first person to come to mind, is woman I haven�t seen in what feels like forever but often think of. Allison, my Hawaiian love came to mind. I redirected my thoughts away from my frightening present moment and thought of her and the wonderful memories we shared. Another woman came to mind shortly thereafter, Jess. The only other woman I�ve truly loved. The thoughts of her lead me to a blissful state, even though my external surroundings were drastically different than the beautiful memories I mentally placed myself in. Truly an impressive thing the mind is, allowing you to shift your mental state just with sheer will. Then my current girlfriend came to mind, Kendra. It was in this moment that I realized I�ll never love her the way I loved those two women. We�ll talk more about the loves of my life in a different chapter, but for now let�s focus on the story of how I survived a brain cyst. Once, the procedure was completed I was excited to see the results. Thinking I could just walk to behind the glass where the technicians worked while conducting my MRI, to view the images they received. To my surprise I was told that It was illegal, due to patient confidentiality laws, for me to enter that potion of the room. Which was clearly disappointing news, as I was primed and ready to see what lie inside my skull. They informed me the next step was to await a phone call from the doctor�s office, so I could setup an appointment to come in and review my results with the doctor by my side. After a brief discussion about how the MRI works with the technicians, and the side effects of the procedure.  I headed to the locker, got changed back into my clothes and left the hospital. Given my impatient nature, especially when regarding my health. I called the doctor�s office immediately after walking out of the hospital�s front doors. After holding for a few moments, a pleasant female voice answered the phone, I informed her of what had just happened and requested to be scheduled as soon as possible. She then informed me that the doctor would review my MRI images and then reach out to me. So, I waited. Waited for what felt like forever but was truly probably only a week. Finally, I got a call. The same woman I had talked with a week prior, informed me that the doctor would like me to come in at my soonest convince. Given the sensations I had been experiencing, I made this a priority and was able to come in the following day. There I was, sitting in the parking lot of my neurologist�s office, contemplating what was about to happen. I feared the worse, words I do not want to think let alone type out. I was afraid he was going to tell me this was the beginning of the end. After some deep breathing in the parking garage, I was ready to go in. I arrived promptly on time, and after a very brief wait, was escorted to my room. Today is may 20th, and I just left the local nuero surgeons office. After chatting with him I feel more like I have a good idea of how to move forward. He believes the best course of action is for me to move forward with more tests prior to doing anything invasive. Which I support. His and the other brain docs diagnosis is that, I have something called Pseudotumor or idiopathic intercranial hypertension. This is good news as there is no atrophy within the brain, and the main issue is the increased ICP. However, after somre research it seems like this can cause permanent vision damage. Which is terrifying. Furthermore, there is a correlation between Doxyclicye and this, so I�m hoping I can get some VA funds as they could be responsible for this even coming about. If I can get 100% disability from the feds, then I�m set for life, at least finaclly. The way forward is clear, well sort of. The local docs don�t want me to disregard Kim�s advice and follow there�s as Kim is not local, and is remotely taking care of me. Which makes sense. I was blinded by the title and the idea that the FAA will not allow me to have a cyst in my head and fly, however, I disregarded the idea of a waiver, which could have saved me from undergoing that experience and moving forward to a more educated treatable option. FUCK. However that�s in the past, and at the time I thought it made since. Although the controversy surrounding the cyst made the matter much more hard to understand. I accept all possible outcomes, If I go blind, I may opt out. Moving forward is a MRI, eye exam and a psych evaluation. Holy shit this is like a drama that keeps unfolding, not to mention the 100k bill I got last night. DUDE, WHAT.  This is all so surreal, I just pray that I will make it out of this better than before, and that I will be able to articulate this expeirnce so that others can walk down this road without having to actually walk this path themselves. Right now I�m in the thick of it, and its hard to dedicate the time to writing this down articulately. But I feel confident that if I brain dump on this sheet over the coming weeks, then I�ll be able to return to this and piece together the mayhem. However, in the event I do go blind. I must devote time to this book NOW as who knows, what tomorrow will hold for my health.

This is basically a rantI wanna fucking cry i miss someone and i cant even see them today, like i wanna spend time with people i know and love, not people i barely met like 5 months ago when i was forced to love them, they will never be apart of who i consider family when they left their own kids for drugs and a boyfriend, id rather spend my time on people who aren't jackasses. The saying is the blood of the coven is thicker then the water of the womb, not blood is thicker then water. She isn't and will never be my grandmother, she just gave birth to my dad and thats it. I dont want her hugs, i dont want her gifts, i dont want her love. If she couldnt love her own kids until they were in their 40s why would i want to let her into my life? That makes no sense. Biologically she may be my grandmother but in my mind she is nothing more then a stranger who gave birth to my father. Don't expect kids to just accept you if you abandoned their parents for 37 years. I dont want you in my life. I dont want you in my dads either.TDLR; My dads mom came back into his life after abandoning him for a boyfriend, i don't like her.

 I have spent thirty years in Burningham, here everyone is haunted by something. Sometimes I�m questioning what I�m doing with my life: should I leave and look for a new change of scenery, or should I stay and try to get my life back together? My parents were retired doctors and were in great shape for people in their sixties. They died recently.When I found out I didn�t eat or sleep for a few days. They were on their way to Italy for vacation. An hour into their flight, the plane crashed over the Adriatic Sea, and everyone on board died. The media ran stories that the crash was caused by pilot error, but that couldn�t be true. Black box audio is usually made public, but the audio for Burningham Airlines Flight 1357 was never released and kept from the public.Deep on the web, theories came flooding in like water through a broken dam. Despite the best efforts of the government to sweep this under the rug, the families of everyone who died on board, myself included, demanded answers. We didn�t get any, until the audio was leaked. The audio started off normally. The pilots were having an ordinary conversation, until  they both noticed *something*. The next thirty seconds of the audio was completely silent.Suddenly, the two pilots started confessing all their sins. The last three minutes of the recording were only screams of the passengers. There was something one of the pilots said that really distrubed me. I was able to make it out through the heavy turbulence.*�I shouldn�t have left my baby in the hot locked car I�m so sorry.� He said.*As strange as the recording was, I decided to move on and forget the theories I read online. It really didn�t matter, did it? Pilot error or not, my parents were dead.Two weeks later, I held a mock funeral. I was the only one there. Because I was the only family left, it was up to me to get their house cleaned up and ready to sell. I was not looking forward to the probate process.As I pulled into the driveway, the house stood before me, a poor copy of what it used to be. What once was a lush, well-kept lawn was now overgrown with dry, yellowed grass. Thankfully, the house and second garage across from it was made of brick. I feared to imagine what shape they�d be in if they hadn�t been built with such a material. Brush was piled into the old rusty dog cage across from the garage.As I walked up the path, childhood memories flashed through my mind:Dad tossing the ball to ten year old me, Mom helping me walk the dog around the house when I was twelve.The memories quickly faded, and reality sunk in. I�d never be able to make memories with them again, I was over everything up until this point. My knees buckled and I dropped to the ground, tears streamed down my face and I couldn�t control it anymore. They were gone forever, nothing could change that. I took a few deep breaths and counted to ten. After my breathing exercises I felt right as rain.I picked myself up off the floor and entered the house. It was eerie being in the house for the first time in years. The inside of the house didn�t look abandoned a part of me felt like Mom and Dad were still in their bedroom or living-room. It was like being inside of one of the houses in Chernobyl. Everything in the house looking the same day it did when it was abandoned. Canned food and boxed food was still in the cabinets, mouse droppings laid on the floor, the smell of mold and mildew was so strong I could taste it.I held my breath and trudged forward to the bedrooms to look for my parents� financial information. After a few minutes of rummaging through their bedroom I found the paperwork also, I found something else. A box of letters that I have never seen before written by people I�ve never met.*Letter 1**Dear, Uncle Tony Nov. 14th, 1989**Happy Birthday Uncle Tony! Love is not something you can see. Love is something you feel deep in your heart, and I love you!**Love, Lorraine.*Really strange. The letter is addressing my father, but he and my mother didn't have any siblings. Why lie? Did he have a falling out and as a result he didn�t want anything else to do with his family?*Letter 2**Dear, Uncle Tony Nov. 21th, 1989**I really like staying over and spending time with you and Aunt Pam. I love staying up past my bedtime to watch cartoons and eat chocolate chip cookies. At bedtime it really scared me when I heard tapping on my window. I covered myself with my blanket and turned over, but the tapping just continued.**Lorraine,*Mom�s chocolate chip cookies were my favorite thing in the world when I was a kid. I�ll never taste them again...*Letter 3**Dear, Uncle Tony Nov. 28th, 1989**I had lots of fun building snow forts with you and Aunt Pam last weekend. I had more fun when I caught the both of you by surprise and nailed you with snowballs. It was fun until bedtime, the tapping started again and this time I couldn�t help, but turn over. I saw a monster at my window. I started feeling really guilty and sad as I stared at him. There was something mesmerizing about that thing at the window. Unable to look away I started remembering all sorts of bad stuff I did, like breaking Mom's vase and lying about it. I smashed my head against the wall to make the thoughts stop.**Lorraine,**Letter 4**To: Tony Dec. 4th, 1989**I�m happy to let Lorraine spend the weekend over your house. You�re family after all and I want her to know her Uncle and Aunt. You and Pam have really been there for Lorraine and I ever since Rick abandoned us a few years ago. But Lorraine came home on Sunday with a bruise on her forehead. Please make sure you keep an eye on her when she�s playing.**Susan,*Really sad. I had a friend whose father abandoned them when they were young. Life hasn�t turned out well for them.*Letter 5**Dear, Uncle Tony Dec. 8th, 1989**I�m really looking forward to spending X-mas with you! Thank you for buying me a barbie. I love her so much. I played with her until that monster showed up. I saw him and started feeling guilty like last time. I remembered when I told a kid at school yellow snow was the same as a yellow snow cone, and he ate it. I smashed my head again and this time it really hurt.**Lorraine,**Letter 6**Dear, Pam Dec. 18th, 1989**For whatever reason Tony hasn�t bothered to listen to me. I�m looking forward to having X-mas with you, but Lorraine got a bigger bruise on her forehead. How is she getting hurt so much?**Susan,**Letter 7**Dear, Pam Jan. 1st, 1990**I really appreciate you and Tony having us over for the holidays, but there�s something really odd that happened when I was there. I was awakened by a knock on my door. Lorraine was crying and telling me that someone was tapping on her window. I walked into the room she was staying in. At first I thought there was something at the window, but chalked it up to my imagination since I was still half asleep. Clearly, I have not been listened too. I do not think I can allow her over your house if you continue not to listen. I�ll allow the both of you one more chance. I do not want to have to do this, but if you force my hand I will do what I feel is best.**Susan,**Letter 8**Dear, Uncle Tony Jan. 4th, 1990**I really enjoy seeing you and Aunt Pam, I don�t know if I wanna come over anymore. I couldn�t sleep last time. I�m really scared to go over.**Lorraine,**Letter 9**Dear, Tony and Pam Jan 7th, 1990**I can not allow Lorraine at your house. When she got home from the last visit she said she never wanted to go back and wouldn�t stop crying. I don�t know what happened, but she is not going to your home anymore. I�m furious that my rules were not obeyed! How dare you undermine me! I think you know how Lorraine got hurt too, but I�m starting to think it wasn�t just an accident due to your negligence.**Susan,**Letter 10**Dear, Tony and Pam February 1st, 1990**How dare you try and play the victim. You want me to reconsider? No way! If you guys didn�t hurt Lorraine then how come you can�t at the very least admit the both of you are negligent care takers? How dare you throw in my face all the things you did for Lorraine financially, emotionally, or otherwise. Don�t try to spin me a sob story �Lorraine is the daughter I�ll never have.� Cry me a river. Also, never throw my condition in my face again! I�ve been just fine mentally and I�ve been taking my medicine. My illness has nothing to do with the decision I�m making. I laughed when I read the part of your letter when you mentioned you were afraid for the child�s well-being because I�m unwell. Don�t ever threaten me! You�ll never see Lorraine or me again as long as you live.*It looked to be the end of the letters. I needed answers so, I searched the house for any letters, but found nothing.I gave up.Feeling defeated I gathered myself and grabbed the paperwork I needed, then headed home. During the ride home I felt like something was following me, I ascribed the feeling to just being on edge due to the letters. I pulled into the driveway of my home, feeling empty. My house was a mess, not as bad as my parents� house, but still a mess. The lawn was unkempt, white peeling paint on the front porch and on either side of the house indicated that a new paint job was needed. It�s not like it really mattered anyway no one was going to come visit me.I was alone.The mailbox was overflown with a thick stack of mail. I removed the mail then headed inside. A few days worth of dishes were piled in the sink, also the trash can was crammed full with fast food bags. Ever since the death of my parents I�ve been barely taking care of myself. I threw my letters down on the table, nothing but bills and junk mail.There was nothing to look forward too anymore. I dragged myself to bed and laid down. As my eyelids became heavier and I was about to drift off to sleep, I had the feeling that someone was watching me. I heard an ominous tapping on my window. But didn�t dare turn over to see what was causing the noise.

Me and my siblings were on a road trip through Finland. This happened about two weeks in when we were on our way to some relatives we'd never met before. On the way our GPS malfunctioned and we ended up on something you couldn't really call a road (it was completely sand) in the middle of nowhere. Eventually we were bound to get stuck. So after a few tries to no avail we decide to call them to come help us out. Some time goes by and a truck shows up and a man steps out. We small talk a bit and explain our situation. He starts immediately helping us up with a wire. In the middle of everything another bald man shows up walking alongside two kids. We ask who he is, so he tells us that he is the relative we were going to visit, but ironically he also got stuck. All of us are really confused and my brother asks the man who first came who he is. The answer was just a stranger passing by. Much later we get help by our relatives friend who luckily owns a tractor.

 M(f19):MeF(f21):fucked up friend B(m23): friend�s boyfriend I was laying in bed, it was about 12:15am, and I got a call from F who was at a work party. F: Hey can you pick me up I�m stranded and really drunk I need a ride home. I tell her I�ll be there in less than a half hour since it was across the city. I show up to the house and go inside to get her and meet all her coworkers. We leave with everyone else I help her into the passenger seat because she is clearly too intoxicated to stand on her own. So we�re on our way home and she says she wants taquitos. When we are a block and a half away from taquitos she tells me she has to puke RIGHT NOW! So, I pull over and she sticks her head out the door but doesn�t puke, but decides she actually has to pee. The second she steps out of the car she completely drops to the ground, so I run out of my car and hold her up so she can pee. She also decided she wants McDonalds now so we�re in the drive thru just about to get up to the window to pay and get food. Keep in mind that I drive a car that stands out like a sore thumb. It�s a bright red Grand Voyager with airbrushed flames coming up the hood. She sticks her head out the door again and starts aggressively vomiting and shitting through her pants onto my seat. So then she decided to get out of the car, in the middle of the drive thru, pull down her pants AND WIPE HER BARE SHITTY ASS ALL OVER MY SEAT!!!I roll down the windows and close her door for her. I am paying for the food at this point and she�s passed out, I think everything�s done and over with...But I was wrong. We have now arrived at her house. I tell her to not move and that I�ll be right back with her boyfriend since this clearly was a 2 man job. I went inside and the door that�s always open every other time I�ve been there is LOCKED and I don�t know her password to her phone or where her keys are so I have to run back outside to get her. I walk out of the backyard and see my passenger door wide open, with her face planted on the snow covered side walk projectile shitting and vomiting at the same time. M: you need to get up.While she�s getting up she plants her hand in some shit and manages to get up. After she stands up and gains her balance I sayM: please don�t move and DON�T TOUCH ANYTHING!F: It�s fine don�t worry.She then decides to slick her hair back with shit all over her hand. M: STOP! PLEASE STOP!!She then leans her forehead covered with shit ON MY FACE. Like I kid you not half my face had this bitches shit all over it. So I decide I�m pulling out my phone and taking a video of her so she can see it in the morning because there was no way she was remembering any of this. I get her inside the house and pull out her phone, get her password and call her boyfriend to come let us in. B(on the phone @1:30am): so you finally decided to answer your phone. M: B this is M please come let us in the door right now. I�m not messing around please open this door.B opens up the door pretty much instantly. First thing F tries to do is to give B a hug M:No! Shower! Now!F then makes a break for the bedroom.M: SHOWER! NOW!!!I get her in the shower and get her clothes off her and get her in the shower. Half way through her shower I made B come in and help her out and into bed, so I could go clean my vehicle. That took me about an hour and 45 minutes and you can�t even really tell that there was a half inch of shit caked on my seat. Turns out at 11:30pm B texted F telling her he was awake and to let him know when she needed a ride home. So she wasn�t stranded. Also she said she only had 3 glasses of wine (2 filled half way and 1 filled to the rim) and a beer and she doesn�t remember anything after 11pm.

I haven�t been dreaming lately, and it�s been bothering me profusely Since I was young I�ve had a grand imagination, and I spent a great deal of time in my headIt only started to fade a year ago, and it�s left me with a funny feelingI don�t think there�s anything inherently wrong with meI just think it�s because I�ve been beginning to live out my dreams

I'm texting this because I want to share my problems and thoughts with someone, because I can't do it in real. I'm already at high school and I should choose my future profession, university and start to prepare to exams, but I'm so scared. There is a million thoughts in my head, I'm afraid that I can not pass my exam or the university where I want to study would not take me. I am trying to study, trying to get ready to exams, but It feels like time is running out.What should I do?

Still Smiling: The Hardest Thing About Event Caricaturing

I�m an event caricaturist. I get booked almost weekly for receptions and company events. In the back of my car I keep a folding table and chair, a pop-up sign, and a satchel for art supplies. I haul these to events, set up, and with a soft-leaded pencil and endless sheets of paper, I draw quick and flattering likenesses in under three minutes. I have a three-hour minimum, and I�ve put in 12-hour days. I provide entertainment, novelty, and a takeaway gift for the attendees, and I�ve been doing it for 19 years.

Over these years I�ve honed my craft to the point where I don�t have to think about it. I draw what I see�quickly. It�s automatic. If the conditions are right�enough light, enough people, an occasional snack�art happens. But managing the people, and putting them at ease while I�m drawing them, that�s work. It feels weird to be drawn. I make the process easier by chatting with my subjects. But the chatting wears me out, and the hardest part is that people ask the same questions, and make the same jokes, over and over.

�How long have you been doing this?�

�Do you have a real job?�

�Does your hand get tired?�

�Draw me like one of your French girls.�

�Can you photobomb a caricature?�

�I�m already a character!�

It�s disturbing that people are so predictable. To hear the same thing from different people at different locations at different times in my life. It�s honestly the hardest part of doing what I do. When people sit in front of me and parrot these lines, it�s like we turn briefly into marionettes, forced to do a repetitive dance.

It�s okay, though. I understand they�re uncomfortable and don�t know what else to say. Maybe they�re genuinely curious; maybe they�re tapping into some sort of cultural zeitgeist with their unoriginal jokes. I get it; we get past it. But the fact that they say these same phrases still unsettles me. In that way, I guess I�m predictable too.

Still, I always answer cheerfully, joke back, and ask them about their day, family, hobbies, profession, books, movies, sports�whatever. I try to find the thing that makes them relax, open up, and smile. Then I smile back.

Because I love caricaturing. I love getting lost in my weird craft. I love too, the way people react when I give them the thing I�ve drawn. Drawing people has helped me connect with and appreciate others. I guess I even enjoy�for the most part�talking to all these strangers. It�s hard to stare at someone for three minutes or so, and not feel a connection. I meet them, and I�m able to give them a souvenir of this moment in their lives. I honestly feel fortunate to be able to do that.

Sometimes I think about all the people I�ve drawn over the years, all these faces floating around the world, tens of thousands of them by now. How crazy is that? Some framed and on display, some lost and forgotten, but all still smiling. It makes me smile too.

(This was shortly after 9/11) My teacher was at an airport and waiting for boarding when she saw a middle eastern man without any luggage and with just a briefcase (similar to the terrorists who carried out 9/11) Considering the recent attacks, she came to the conclusion that this man was a terrorist. after boarding she didn�t see him anywhere, so she checked in the bathroom thinking he was making a bomb or something. Her husband was trying to persuade her that nothing was happening, but she didn�t believe it.It turns out that he was the pilot! Her husband tried to get her to apologize, but she couldn�t build up the courage, plus what would she say?I�m on mobile don�t bully me(I don�t think my teacher is racist, but she was irrationally paranoid and scared as many people were after 9/11)

I was a wee lad of 14 years old. Me and my like-minded group of friends had suffered through math or whatever and made it to our one hour of sandwich sanctity. Lunch. We had decided to go outside to have fun eating whilst being bombarded with horrible disease carrying insects.The door outside had a waist-high pole in place to prevent damage to the wall. I - in a flash of brilliance - had stood atop this pole, wielding the door for support. A triumphant boom erupted from my mouth. �I AM THE KING OF PENIS! THE SELF-PROCLAIMED KING OF PENIS!� I had looked down to my underlings, in expectation of a respectful bow to their new leader. Instead I was faced with looks of wide eyed shock and quick glances toward the door. I looked towards the door and was greeted by the malicious dictator of the neighbouring kingdom. The middle school janitor. Just as I had remembered from our last dual. Jeans, an A-Shirt, handlebar moustache, 5.5 plump stature - it was unmistakable!It was his same grizzly, baritone voice. �Get down.� Out of respect for my foes final command, I had dismounted my throne. This is the story of the king of penis. May his shaft remain stiff in Valhalla.

Oh, hey, it's me again. You know, the kid whose entire life seems like a dumpster fire? I'm back at it again with stories from one of my friends. Who is a psychopath. I don't just mean they're crazy or whatever, I mean like an actual psychopath. Like, psychiatrist diagnosed I guess you could say. He's literally a psycho. Why am I friends with him? He seemed really nice and charming, like literally every psychopath out there. Later, I found out that wasn't true. I mean, being friends with him meant he never manipulated or took advantage of me. That and I will admit, I have some psychopathic personality traits that helped me see when he was trying, so he kind of respected me for that. Either way, this kid is kind of messed up. He thinks its fun to watch life-long friend ships unravel. He did it a few months ago. There were these two girls who'd been friends since they were toddlers. They did everything together. As you know, psychopaths are really good at imitating emotions. So he started acting all friendly with one of the girls. Trying to become her friend but without the other one really noticing. And he was terrifyingly good at it. He figured out some of the things that girl hated about the other, which was inevitable. Then he befriended the other one and found the same thing out from her. Then he told them that the other thought about them. He did it in a way that instead of realizing he was spreading things about them and seeing it was his fault, they started spreading things about each other. It's like they started the fire, he just bought the matches. What really scares me is how good he is a pretending to show emotion. We went to a sleepover on time, and all the other kids were upstairs. We were sleeping in the basement, because it was huge and they set up tents and mattresses with fairy lights everywhere. When it was just me and him, there was no emotion. He just deadpanned everything he said, with this dead look in his eye. And as soon as one of the parents came down to check on us, he switched so fast it terrified me. I was like , "How the heck did you just switch that fast?!" and he went back to is usual emotionless self and shrugged.Yeah, just wanted to share that. The dude's insane. He likes starting fight between people and then watching them tear each other apart. Hopefully, me being friends with him he leaves my friend group alone.

 First of all I apologize if there is some grammar mistakes, English it's no my mother language. It all started when she came to our home to help me during the last days of my pregnancy and until the baby arrives, during that time I was feeling really tired my belly was enormous and all I wanted to do was stay in bed as long as I could, she started to say all the time that I shouldn't be to much time lay down because the baby will '' stick inside'' and won't be able to come out, I knew that I had to do some fisics activity to help me induce labor but I was too tired all the time, she often said things like go have sex with my son to help the baby to come out and it was so uncomfortable to her that ALL THE TIME!!I passed my due date and she stated to insist on all this like... A LOT!! I got my medical appointment a week later to hear the baby's heart and I had a contraction there and apparently the baby was not having a good time inside, I got really scared and felt really bad because the last week's I was to tired to try to induce labor naturally so my BF and I stayed trere, she went to visit me several time and said so much I told you so that I started to get really sick of her but I didn't want to be rude so I didn't ask her to leave she said all the time that I was going to need a C-section and I did not wanted that I wanted to do it naturally if I could.The day passed and we stayed another day, the doctors try everything to induce labor... Nothing worked, so I had an emergency C-section for the sake of the baby, at that point I was OK with that as long as my baby was safe. She went to visit us the next day she was really happy so I though that the worse passed But she said I TOLD YOY SO, soo many times that I felt really guilty and it doesn't stop there, the baby needed to be hospitalized because of some complications during labor, I got depressed and wanted to be alone as much as I could I cried all the time and she was there all the time as well to tell me that I shouldn't cry because it would affect the baby, I didn't cry when I breast feed my baby (I'm not that stupid) but the time I was out the new borns area I cried I felt really guilty for that, but dam I needed to cry I needed to get it all out!!! And she saying that me crying will afecct the baby made me felt worse I started to hate her!!I wanted her to leave!!! But she stayed there the whole time, I was hospitalized as well and I wanted my BF to stayed with me not her but since she had back pain he gave her his bed and went to sleep outside, guys.... The last thing I wanted was to be separated from him as well but I was to sad to said something about it.It all passed and my baby was OK to go home but a nurse will keep visiting him to see the progress in home I was so happy to finally have my son in home with me! Once in home she helped with the cooking and I was ok with that I needed the help but she stated to complain about how I had the kitchen cabinets, about my bed sheets and everything she could find (it's not like she is an organized person but she wanted to make me feel bad I think ) and I got really mad and stayed at my room as much as I could I wanted her to leave asap!!!That night my BF and I were going to give the first bath to our baby and I was excited about that and apparently he told her mom to make a video of it without consulting me about it and I told him that I did not want a video of that she listened that and grab her phone and throw it away really hard she make a tantrum and started to yell at us, I couldn't resist any more and started to cry I didn't want to star a fight out of this I just wanted TO BATH MY BABYBOY IN PRIVATE!!! my BF got really mad and kicked a chair and make a strong noise while his mom continued saying things I couldn't understand, she left home.MI BF apologize to my while I was crying my eyes off, my baby needed to eat and I had to breastfeed while I was crying I felt such a terrible mom I wanted to run away from everything.She left that weekend and since she's been away I am more peaceful and happy, but sometimes I remember all that and start to cry, I don't want to see her anymore but she is my baby's grandmother so I have to try to forget all this, and this is why I wrote this To get it out of my chest, I feel like I can't remember my baby's birth without been traumatized for all this.

This is a story about probably the weirdest thing that's ever happened to me. This is gonna sound like it belongs on r/thathappened, and honestly if you don't believe me, i don't blame you. even if my closest friends told me this story I wouldn't believe them because it's so weird. So, I'm in high school. Im 16, was maybe 15 when this happened. It was late 2019.For some background, I have a couple Instagram accounts. most of the people that follow me are friends from school, and then their mutual friends who go to my school or local schools. My main account has maybe 140 followers at the time, and my spam account has 80ish. Most of the people that follow my spam are people I've never met. People who I follow for memes, or who are mutuals of people that follow my main.I average maybe 3 likes on a spam post, 8-12 on a main account post. Spam account is memes, main account is selfies. What I'm getting at here is that i am popular by no means. Most of the likes I get are always from the same people. The same couple of people I don't really know who just like all of my posts. I always assumed they just scrolled through their timeline and liked everything.So, on to the story. I was attending a football game at my school, going through the pass gate because I'm there as a photographer. There's a girl standing in front of the table at the pass gate, talking to my teacher, who was running it. Then she sees me. Insanity ensues.She looks at me and gasps, "I recognize you! You're [name] right? I follow you on both your Instagram accounts I'm a huge fan! You're really cool and cute and I like all your posts!" I thanked her and talked to her for a couple minutes but all I can think the entire time is, "fan of what? is she high? maybe she's just another freshman that really wants to get with an upperclassman"  I walked away from this brief interaction entirely baffled, had a crisis for a few minutes, and realized I had zero idea who that girl was. And there wasn't very many people who it could've been. Only about 3 people consistently liked all of my posts and followed me on both accounts.After some confused digging, I figured out who she was, and realized she went to my school! I had never seen her before, and honestly she looked COMPLETELY different in person. Now, it's pretty easy to go without ever seeing someone at my school if your classes just align that way but I seriously haven't seen her since this happened and I'm starting to wonder if she's even real. Did I hallucinate this girl?My teacher had witnessed the whole thing and didn't even acknowledge it or say anything about it. Am I The only person that thinks this is really weird??? Like, this doesn't just happen to people? If I were actually attractive or popular or posted funny memes, sure. But I am not, and do not. I know this sounds unbelievable and weird but it was so strange and I've never really talked about it before. I was watching an rslash video on r/thathappened and was reminded of this crazy story. Just wondering if ANYONE out there has had something similar happen, or if I'm going crazy.

When I was a young teenager, I had a BB gun and loved shooting pretty much everything. Leaves, distant trees, shaken soda cans, no trespassing signs, etc.We had a nice back yard with a big garden that opened up to the forest. An above-ground pool sat directly behind the house and the garden spread out around it, down a slope and into the woods. On the patio was my dad's grill.It was a hot Wisconsin summer day, perfect for an adventure in the woods with my BB gun. I scanned the yard for targets and shot willy nilly into the trees. I walked along the patio, past the pool and to the grill. Climbing along the front of the grill was a ladybug about to die.I pumped the gun, aimed the barrel and FIRE! The ladybug was toast. I was SO proud. Smiling, I turned to look for my next target and that's when I saw it, a smooth stream of water jetting out a BB size hole in the side of the pool.I don't remember where my parents were at the time but my little brother was home. I screamed for him to come help me and he came running. I tried using my thumb to block the water but the pressure kinda made it hurt. We took turns with our thumbs, trying to figure out a solution.I didn't have a good track record of intelligent decision making up until this point but I was still the older brother. I was going to plug the hole. How? With woodchips of course! I picked what seemed to be the right size and when my brother took his thumb away, the water sprayed fast and hard. I took the stick and jammed it in the hole. Water was now spraying in completely new directions. The hole was also slightly bigger.I quick ran inside, opened the cupboard and grabbed a roll of duct tape, life's fix it material. Back outside, I contemplated my next move. I'd tape around the hole then remove the stick and slap down more tape over the hole. That'll do it!Well, it worked, kinda. There was still water leaking through the tape. I taped more tape. Still water coming out but not nearly as much. More tape! I kept taping until pretty much the entire panel was covered and I had no more tape. It took a long time.My parents would be home soon and they'd know what to do. We at least "saved" it. My brother and I stared at the damaged pool and both of us smiled.I want to say there was a huge sound but really it was almost silent. The tape gave way pretty quickly and the damaged panel tore in half, then flopped wide open. The entire pool emptied in about three seconds. Chlorinated water flooded my Mom's garden. My brother and I, helplessly horrified, watched the nice back yard turn not nice. Not gonna lie, I was scared. Scared of what I did, how I did it, bringing my brother into my mess, my impending punishment, losing my BB gun.My parents came home and yup, they were shocked. I tried explaining myself but this was a case of immediate grounding. I went to my room and cried. My dad cleaned up the pool shreds the rest of that afternoon while my mom cried too. I don't remember how long I was grounded but it was the longest of all my groundings. They also took away my gun.Now now, don't get too sad. Everyone was initially upset but it wasn't the end of the world. My dad didn't love the regular pool maintenance and to be honest, the pool wasn't used very often. Also, my mom's garden as a result of getting rid of the pool, became much larger and even better! The entire space opened up and was transformed.I helped my mom replant her garden and we bonded a lot while bringing new life to that spot. I learned much about gardening because of it and love gardening to this day. My dad got into birding and put in a heated bird bath as garden focal point. We built paths and planted flowers, making the back yard even nicer and our relationships stronger.

People asked how i got a scar from birth so i decided to share the tale of how i got a scar on my head.A long time ago in the age of boomers and gen z, my mother was on the verge of giving birth when the doctor noticed that my feet were coming out first.Quickly he tried to get my mom to stop but she just cussed at him in anger (as one does) but eventually stopped pushing.After a quick ultrasound it turned out i was not only upside down but also my umbilical cord was around my neck so being born regularly would in essence hang me.So they opted for a c-section.Time was ticking and every minute that passed could mean the cord can get more tight around my body and neck.By the time they got my mom medicated enough to preform the opperation they had to hurry as when they got to me i was already looking bad, so the doc had no choice but cut the cord with his scalpel and he nicked my head in the proces.From what i heard from my parents if i was not cut out that moment i would have suffered brain damage or worse.To this day i am not sure if my autism could be a cause of that incident or if i would have had it anyway, but i am happy to be here to this day and have a scar to show for my troubles.TLDR: unborn me was playing a high stake game of hangman with the docter and he cut me free giving me a scar.Sorry if my spelling or grammar is off i am not a native english speaker and am on mobile.

It was the annual 7th grade trip time. I�d done the same trip in 5 and 6th grades. So here I was with 29 other classmates some of whom I�d only known for a week and 4 teachers.  Apparently the seafood I had the night before I left wasn�t good. The first day went fine until about halfway through the night. At 2am I rummaged around for my flashlight, climbed over my tent mates and then exited the tent. I walk the .4 miles to the outhouse and did my business. Just a lot of poop. It was normal texture though so I didn�t think anything of it. It was just more than usual. I ate breakfast and packed my sandwich for the hike. I think it was 11 am when I realized I had to poop. I was way to embarrassed to tell these teachers in front of all the kids that I needed to poop 2 hours into our 7 hour hike. So I held it. Turns out you can�t hold it forever. At 11:30, right before lunch, I knew I needed to go. I told the teachers I needed to go to the bathroom and they pointed to a tree. It took a lot of courage to explain that I needed to go #2. They passed over a shovel and a little role of toilet paper. I ran and dug my hole. I then preceded to piss out my ass. It used the rest of the role of toilet paper and it didn�t all fit in the ziploc bag so I had to leave some in the hole. I returned and the teachers asked if everything was fine because I took so long. I said yes and then had to answer my friends questions about where I was. I said I dropped my water bottle at our last break spot and went back to find it. I ate lunch and felt a little better before it took a turn for the worst. We started hiking again and I knew it wasn�t over. 30 minutes later and I had to poop again. I couldn�t ask a teacher for the �Shit Kit� because I used all the toilet paper and also it would seem so weird that I asked again. So I just fell to the back of the line and found a rock to sit on and pooped over the edge. More diarrhea than before ugh. I had nothing to wipe with but my underwear so I wiped with it. I ran back up to the group. I had to do this about 4 more times every 30 minutes for the next 2 hours. Then about an hour before we returned to camp it happened. I thought I had to fart but instead it was liquid shit. I fell behind and then took out my spare pair of pants from my backpack and changed behind a tree. The pants and the underwear smelled so bad that I had to ditch them. I put them under a log with a little note that said �I had an accident, sorry for the litter�. I was running back up to my group when this couple asked me if I was ok. When I asked why they said they saw me naked shitting on a log. I explained what was happening and they helped me clean up. I ran back up to my group and somehow they hadn�t noticed I was gone. When we were finally back at camp, I took the longest shit ever and was finally able to clean up. The next day my poop was closed to solid but I felt nauseous all day until I got home. Worst trip everFeel free to share your diarrhea stories below or wilderness shit stories

  Bit of backstory, we live in a small town (80-something thousand people right now.) And we live in an even smaller neighborhood, houses are spaced about the length of a football field out from eachother and everyone has sprawling back fields of several acres. For the most part everybody knows everybody, there are only about 6 houses down the length of a mile. Now right next door to us, there was always one guy. everyone knew his name but half the neighborhood only ever saw him when he drove his four-door pickup through the windows of the truck.  This happened roughly 6 years ago, we'll call the creepy old guy Jenson.&#x200B;  We don't really pay much mind to Jenson, we knew he was usually just working at night, but one mid-spring, this guy tapes up all his windows with heavy duty reflective duct tape, except in the basement windows, which have wet concrete mix over them. His outer door which has glass windows to see out of is taped up, with an inside door with no windows. Strange but nobody really wanted to question it, then we see the missing pet posters go up all around the road on the wire poles. (The tall metal/wood poles that carry electrical wiring from the city out to the country.) , one of our neighbors had lost two dogs.  It was enough to raise some suspicion, but still nobody voices any assumptions yet. Over the course of that spring people's fences were trashed, pets went missing if they were outside at night,  and the few people who grew crops saw their food being stolen. This wasn't unrealistic to expect of coyotes or wolves which we've had before, so most people's husbands or older sons stayed up late to sit on the porch with rifles. One of the kids swore up and down he saw the figure of a tall man. &#x200B;We stop seeing Jenson's truck, the only time anyone had seen it  the windows were tinted pitch black, or so the person claimed. The police come to our neighborhood several times that spring, and they did end up talking to Jenson, but he gave some excuse about keeping pests out of his house/keeping it cool with reflective tape over the windows. Eventually someone's had enough, and buys security cameras and DVRs, and starts putting them all over the neighborhood, they're all fairly small and concealable, and we did end up finding some in our yard years later. Well, despite that being a dick move, he did end up catching the perp.&#x200B;The  footage reviewed in court was of Jenson driving out in his truck at midnight, and coming back with a woman with her arms and legs tied, struggling for dear life, taking her into the house, then coming out to park his truck in the garage which he had to manually unlock and lift.  His house had been searched and they found the collars of many of the missing pets, but no bodies or bones, which he admitted he'd sold them off, but they did find the body of four women, two of which he had inseminated and then killed, they found the woman shown in the court footage alive. Since then the house was completely demolished, and someone else claimed the property for cheap, and built their own "dream house" over it. The man who provided the security footage was put to trial after Jenson's, and sentenced to 5 years in prison with a year of probation. Our neighborhood has never really "recovered" from it, most people heavily reinforcing their fences, getting better locks, and refusing to leave pets out after dark. I can't speak for everyone in the neighborhood but my parents have slept with a a gun in their room since (with a sizable period where they didn't due to a story I don't want to get into.)

First post on Reddit so I�m going to post a sweet story of how this crazy kid got expelled. (Not meant to throw shade on anyone)  This happened when I was in 11th grade and my first period was English. There�s this kid who hasn�t showed up for class in about 2 weeks. The teacher didn�t know why and neither did the administrators. He is a very well known �gangster�. I use air quotes because the area we live in is really nice and clean. This kid (we will call him jimmy) walks into first period late as hell and everyone goes silent.  He sits down and the following conversation takes placeTeacher: Where have you been Jimmy?J: doing the business cuh T: Your business is to be in class. Cuh.  J: this class is a joke and I just came here to say hi to (other student a girl he�s been trying to get with)Girl: *rolling her eyes* It�s at this point a administrator along with campus security. Jimmys eyes widen with fear and he gets up and try�s to hide behind the teachers desk. The security, not being fooled by this level 1 sneak trick, started to walk in. Security guy: Jimmy the dean wants a word with you let�s go. Jimmy: he been shot cuh ain�t no body worryin bout him no mo! Security guy: *annoyed* let�s go jimmy before we have to take you out. Jimmy reluctantly left with the security and was reprimanded and phoned home for skipping 2 weeks worth of school. They sentenced him to a months worth of Saturday school and ISS to make up for the lost time. But that�s not all. He sneaks out of ISS and into my second period! High as a kite. It wasn�t long before security got him and was searched and expelled for having a knife and weed on him. I have a lot of stories from my 11th year of school let me know if you guys want more.  TL:DR kid gets punished for skipping school and gets expelled for having a knife and drugs.

I know you never hit me. But some times I wish you did. Mental scars are harder to explain. All I wanted was happiness. And I thought you were the key. But I was just a kid. And all you caused was pain. The words you said. So full of hatred and disgust. �Don�t eat that you�ll get fat� you�d spit. I�d prefer a hit. Then the nasty words that you�d shout. �No one loves you� Made me feel so trapped. How you kept me strapped. You�d ignore me for days. How you�d show up with different girls. �I don�t love you. I never loved you� How you was 18 when I was 14. How you made me think it wasn�t wrong. Turned my life into a hell. You stole them years away from me. Forced me to do things I didn�t want to do. You were just too strong. But I got through. I got away. I�ll never again stay. With a man. Who�d never let my happiness see the light of day.

this happened about 2 years ago. i was home alone in the living room, playing fortnite on my xbox. i was top 15 or something, and started hearing scratching and tapping from my back door. i decided to check it out. my back door is a glass door, and it had a curtain on it. it wasn�t down all the way so i could still see the bottom 1/4.  when i checked to see what was there, i saw a man looking thru. i immediately ran back to my living room and called my mom. i didn�t think she�d believe me so i just said i wasn�t feeling good and to get home soon. when she got home, the first thing i did was check if he was still there and he wasn�t. i assumed it must�ve been some animal and went to bed. i stuck with that idea until i heard rumors of a house being broken into IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.i didn�t win the game

When I was younger, my older sister would always tell me about romance. She'd say that one day, someone will come along. That one day you'll meet someone who'll make all my problems just disappear. That one day you'll be in love. I'd always ask her how you'd know when you were in love, and she would say that you would just know. Fast forward to when I was 10. I became friends with someone called Lemon. Her appearance was basically in her name. Blonde hair, blue eyes. How we met? Well, my biological mother and I would always go to a cherry blossom tree up on a hill. My mother died when I was 6, so I would always go there in memory of her.One day, I went there on my bike and saw a girl crying. I went up to her and hugged her, asking her what was wrong. "My grandmother's in hospital. Theres a chance she might not make it. It's heart disease." She said,  whipping her tears off her cheeks. I stood up, picking a stick with a few cherry blossoms on it. I sat back down and said, "this is sometimes what happens." I took a few cherry blossoms and threw them down the hill. "You cant see them anymore. It's like with family members. Just because you can't see them, doesn't mean they aren't there."Soon, we were talking and laughing. We found out we were going to the same school. Ever since then, we'd hang out. And ten years later we were still friends. Except some things were different, we were both extremely clingy towards each other. We'd text each other till 12 am. Then wake up and text some more. We'd pass notes in class, and of course, we'd always hang out at lunch. One day, I realised that I loved her. The moment I realised was when she took and staring of my hair and tucked it behind my ear. She smiled at me, and I was blushing profusely. She giggled a little. Later that day, we met at the cherry blossom tree and I told her how I felt.She blushed and stayed silent for a while. We both had our hands on the grass, and she slowly moved her hand over to mine until they were touching. Soon we were making out. Like my sister said, love was amazing.

Times were tough. It was no secret I was miserable. A cloud of gloom followed me everywhere, including my job. A relationship breakup like mine would put anyone to the test and frankly, I was failing it. Still, I had bills to pay and it wasn�t going to help if I gave up and stopped getting out of bed. Each day I�d drag myself to the office and go through the motions like a zombie. I know my performance and attitude suffered but I didn�t care at the time. Much of the occupational grief and aggravation of the nine-to-five grind involved being employed so a person could afford nice things and have a fulfilling relationship with a significant other. Once the relative rewards of that dynamic went out the window, so did my motivation to work.I guess it�s a testament to my ability to do my job well, that I wasn�t fired outright after I went off on a difficult client. Behavior like that was a threat to the corporate �bottom line�. Obviously they didn�t want that. Apparently they didn�t want to let me go either. Instead, management tried a very unorthodox tactic which I only found out about much later. They actually hired a temp to �romance� me, and boost my ego. It�s called �the girlfriend experience� because it is supposed to feel �real�. It�s far more than paying a person to be intimate with me. That stipulation wasn�t even in the contract. Legally it couldn�t be. They just paid her to pretend to be infatuated and smitten. How she managed to achieve that artificial flattery was her business. I must say, it totally caught me off guard. In all fairness, I might�ve  recognized the �snow job� a mile away if I wasn�t deeply sad and emotionally vulnerable. Instead I ate up the attention with a spoon. They were smart enough to not hire a supermodel. They found a lady that was probably in the top register of who I might�ve had a chance with in real life, if I tried really hard to woo her. Not that I had to, mind you. She was the definition of a ringer. I gotta say, it takes a certain skill set to seduce a person with that level of believable sincerity. I totally fell for it. They brought her in to the office and assigned her to assist me on a big account. At first, it pissed me off. I didn�t care that she was attractive and working extremely closely with me. I resented the idea of having to hold anyone�s proverbial hand in training her to be actually helpful. To my relief, she was a quick study and eager to learn. Knowing what I know now, I still marvel at the theatrics and lengths the company went through to insert this woman into my life. It is kind of flattering to know they orchestrated the whole thing. I know it was only about the money I normally brought in, but it makes me feel damn important. �Missy� was coy at first. Respectful and aloof even. She maintaining a polite distance while giving off a slight smitten vibe or schoolgirl crush. Like a big knucklehead, I swallowed the performance hook, line, and sinker. The truth is, I wanted to believe. Honestly, who in their right mind would�ve suspected such an elaborate hoax for my behalf? it wasn�t long before we were sneaking off after hours to see each other socially. The whole time, I was scared to death they would send her back to the temp agency. Inter office romance is strictly forbidden by HR so we kept the relationship a secret as long as we could. Once we had moved past a certain point, I didn�t care if anyone found out. I was finally happy again. By all appearances, she was too. I eventually asked her to marry me, and she accepted. Of course I didn�t know it was originally an arranged fling, so I definitely wouldn�t have guessed it was about to lead to an arranged marriage. The thing is, at what point does the facade cease to be worth playing along with for the corporate payout? Even for a person pretending to be interested in me, at some point, you�d think she would call the whole thing off, right? Either that or invent an excuse to break things off and still maintain the original deception. Here was an actress who entered into a contract to perform as �my girlfriend� and then (for whatever reason) kept up the pretense long enough to marry me. At that point I still didn�t know the truth. I would have expected my employers to come clean then but it had went too far. It�s one thing to pay for a brief little office �flirtation�, it�s quite another to keep silent while their gullible employee committed to a legally binding contract. I was blissfully happy and absolutely ignorant to the disturbing truth. She was everything (I thought) I ever wanted. Believe it or not, she confessed the whole organized charade on our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary! I was gobsmacked. I thought it was part of some prank or practical joke but she was dead serious. My whole world crumbled. Our three children were grown up and already out of the house. I�d made partner with the firm and yet, I found out the last 25 years of my life were based on some bizarre farcical performance script. Missy explained that while she had entered into the contract just trying to be a professional actress, she soon developed sincere feelings for me. On one hand, after admitting it started as an elaborate seduction hoax, it was hard to believe anything she said. On the other however, I�d had a quarter century of marital happiness and fantastic kids. Was she finally telling the truth, or was she still acting as a consummate professional actress dedicated to the role? I thought long and hard about it as she slept peacefully beside me. I loved her and I honestly believe she loves me. Much of life is pretending until it becomes true. In the end, does the duration of the facade matter as long as both parties are committed to it?

 Most people enjoy the sublime routine of laying down at night and experiencing a good nights rest and why wouldn�t they? It�s peaceful...you get to relax in a comfortable bed with the soothing hum of an A/C lulling you to sleep. Once you�re asleep your brain releases a cacophony of chemicals that twist and bend to shape a fabulous dreamscape full of impossible realities and quirky findings...it�s your own personal cinematic universe in which you are the protagonist. Usually our dreams can be extremely vivid and mesmerizing, causing them to stick in our minds for extended periods of time, solely for us to remember. Every now and again our brain produces atrocious visions and we can�t wait to forget what we saw, either way it�s an interesting experience. We can all agree that sleeping is a wonderful thing that promotes good health and longevity...that�s the unequivocal truth. I can remember when I couldn�t wait to be able to lay down in my cozy bed, flip my pillow around to the cool side and rest my head on it to drift off into sleep...I wish I still felt that way.  For you to understand this journey I�m about to take you on, you need the brief backstory. A few years ago I was in a brutal accident...my body was left in ruins and my mind shattered from the painkillers, useless thoughts and prayers of what I thought were my family and friends and my own psychosis. Now that I�ve given you the pertinent facts, I think we can proceed...this may be tough to read, so brace yourself. The day started like any other day...I woke up, had some breakfast, kissed my still sleeping girlfriend on the forehead and left for work. I was still smoking weed during this time because it was a useful tool to get me through the stress and monotony of my days when I wasn�t working or engaged in activities with friends. That being said, I decided to make a stop by the ATM to pull out $60 for an eighth so that I could pick some up on my way home from work later that night. I got my hands on the money, I was in a good mood and ready to get to work and finish the day so that I could go home and relax with a joint and some superb whiskey...but the fates decided that something else was in store for me.  I drove out of the parking lot of the bank and pulled up to the stop sign at the intersection and waited for my chance to go as you would expect from any civilized individual. I saw an opening and took it, everything was great...no cars within a dangerous proximity to mine, I didn�t have to speed...it is a small town with scarce traffic after all...then it happened. A truck came flying down the road at sixty miles per hour, which is odd considering it was a thirty five mile per hour zone...before I could accelerate fast enough to get out of the way their truck struck my car sending my vehicle flying fifteen feet onto the nearest sidewalk. Once I awoke in the back of the ambulance the EMT�s informed me that I was knocked unconscious on impact, they told me not to move or panic and I said �Shit, my boss is going to be pissed that I�m late for my shift.� they both laughed and said �At least your sense of humor is still in tact.� We all got a good chuckle out of this and then deafening silence befell the cabin of the ambulance.  Initially I thought nothing of that comment and just relaxed and waited for us to arrive at the hospital for the initial inspection before they moved me to a different hospital for further evaluation. Once I arrived at the intermediate destination things started to connect in a less than fortunate way that are almost comedic in how they unfold. They had me laying down on a stretcher while they examined my body for injuries, swelling, abrasions etc. I was beyond bored and could start to feel the rhythmic pulse of blood filling my extremities. Just when the dull pain began to flair up, two officers approached me with a piece of paper to sign and told me if I didn�t sign it I was going to be detained and face charges, so naturally being in the state I was...I signed the damn paper. After I signed it the medical staff was given the okay to move me into the ambulance and transfer me to the new hospital. I told the nurses to wait and let me call my parents and let them know what happened and that I�m being moved, as you would expect my parents were extremely upset and worried but they packed up their things and told me that they were on the way to meet me.  I arrived at my final stop of the night and this is where the story takes a rather interesting turn. The doctors and nurses got me set up in the first of the four rooms I would be recovering in during my stay at the facility. They go through many processes at this point...regular X-rays, ct-scans, MRI, testing of blood...you know, the usual shit. The doctor gets the results and seems a little disturbed, which is strange because up until this point the guy was very calm and professional...a man who was dedicated to his craft and has seen all kinds of injuries...but something about this made him oddly sheepish. It turns out that my insides were disjointed and ruptured...what exactly am I saying? Well, let�s put it this way...it�s a god damn miracle that I was still alive. This is my favorite part and I think you, the lovely reader...will get a kick out of this.  My spleen was ruptured...leaking blood into the cavity of my lower body...causing my flesh to swell and turn purple. My ribs were cracked...pressing into my lungs with amazing force and my L3 and L4 vertebrae were fractured placing immense pressure onto my spinal column. Now comes the pi�ce de r�sistance, the left hemisphere of my brain was severely bruised resulting in a serious concussion which caused devastating migraines and severe visual and auditory hallucinations. Stay with me, it�s just starting to get good. I promise by the end of this you will understand pain. You will learn to respect and appreciate it, just as I did.  After that night and various medications I was moved into another room, this time with an actual person to keep me company instead of a TV. At least that�s what I thought, but this person was so drugged that the only time they spoke was in their sleep...so we didn�t talk to each other much. The elderly nurse with snow white hair and the gentle touch of a grandmother comes in to help me out of bed into the nearest chair, you see...I�ve basically been in bed for two days straight and she thought it would do me some good. So she helps me out of bed and I struggle, I can barely stand...the pressure on my back was unbearable...the seat was so uncomfortable and stiff I almost cried. After thirty minutes my back is numb from the pain, my toes begin to tingle and my chest begins to burn with the intensity of hellfire. I press the button to call the nurse...she doesn�t come...I wait ten minutes and press it again, no luck...I can�t stand this pain anymore and I need to get back into a soft bed but I can�t do it myself so I sit in excruciating pain for what seems like an eternity. She finally comes back in the room and frantically approaches me all the while telling me that my lung has just collapsed and that I need to remain calm and take the deepest breaths possible.  They come in the room and rush me to the E.R. and the lead surgeon tells me that everything will be okay and that they will fix me up in no time, I trust him...foolishly of course...but I had no other option. They strip me down and put me under, I�m asleep...I know I am...but why can I still hear them? I can�t move or speak but I can hear...what is this? I feel the scalpel carve into my flesh...piercing my loins with razor sharp precision and implanting a plug into my spleen like I�m some kind of fucking bathtub. I want to scream and scurry away like a wounded animal but I can�t fucking move! I think to myself �Oh God! This pain...why can I still feel this!? This is hell...this has to be my imagination...is this a result of the trauma to my brain!? Please make this stop...I can�t fucking take this! God damnit stop cutting me open!� Why the hell am I screaming to myself? They aren�t going to hear me...after all, I�m probably just imagining this. How quaint of me to believe that. I can now feel my side being split open like a raw piece of meat to be injected with a savory marinade...I can feel the tube being inserted into the warm, moist and gaping cavity of my chest...then I feel the fleshy meat of my lung consuming the cold hard tube...like a sopping gangrenous cunt yearning to be penetrated...they force it into me and the putrid fluid begins to pour from me like a vile tankard of mead...how odd that the very thing that helps to save me...makes me feel violated and disgusting. The next few days I begin to slowly recover...after all, they did place the tube too high and my arm keeps applying pressure to it...slowly tearing my stitches open and causing me to bleed internally...how fun it was. I�m taking Percocet and morphine religiously...I make the nurses give me as much morphine as they legally can because it feels so good to be numb...granted it doesn�t stop the pain...but it is a nice distraction. Four days pass and I begin to feel a pressure in my chest again...this time it�s different, not a burning sensation like before, it�s as if something is resting on my sternum. It turns out that the placement of the tube had caused my lung to detach from its original resting position which could be a serious problem if not looked into immediately. Good thing they got me into surgery fairly fast, I was already experiencing death rattles and if just ten more minutes would have passed I would have succumbed from lack of oxygen to the brain. I go into surgery as usual and they cut me open and this time they make the inside of my chest cavity coarse and rough so that the flesh of my lung can meld into the flesh of my chest and form a sturdier bond. This time they get the placement right, but I don�t wake up. It would be a shame if this is how I died, having gone through all of this...if you ask me, it�s a pretty weak way to go. Luckily they give me a shot of adrenaline...it wakes me up and now I can rest and rehabilitate my body. This sedentary lifestyle was increasingly more problematic for me in more ways than one. I was emaciated...I could barely move and every inch of my body was plagued with insurmountable pain. Hell, I couldn�t hold my head up for more than a few seconds before I collapsed into my pillow whilst littering my fragile ego with shame and regret. I was by every definition of the phrase, a shell of my former self...hollow and cold...teetering on the edge of survival. At this point I wasn�t scared or worried about dying, I was curious...I wanted to know if anything was on the other side...simply because this existence had become infuriatingly dismal and I needed a refreshing change of pace. Now I�m just rambling...I know, it�s pathetic...let�s get back into the meat of the story.  All I can do when I�m not being forced to walk is lay down and think about things...yeah I could watch TV...but that incessant drivel doesn�t amuse me in the slightest. The days are hard but the nights were worse, allow me to explain. I barely slept, maybe two hours a night...if I did sleep I would have terribly vivid night terrors of the moment my lung first collapsed and the darkness and pain of the scalpel carving my skin like a Thanksgiving turkey, it was unpleasant yet exciting. Most of the night I would stare at the wall and think about my current situation, tossing and turning in this bed with wires and tubes sticking out of me like some kind of fucked up science experiment...monotony at its finest, my friend. Every now and again something would come over me, almost like an unseen malevolent force tapping directly into my morals and my soul. I would begin to furiously masturbate...crying, gnashing my teeth, smothering myself with my pillow and seductively massaging the tender and fleshy gouges bestowed upon me by the blade...frantically gasping for air while cackling like a madman...trying to do something to amplify my pain because it�s all I had, it was my friend and my lover. The feeling of the stitches scraping against the meat of my ribs...the tube tearing my lung...the festering suppuration leaking from within me was orgasmic...I was a wicked work of art...I had become drunk with pleasure at the thought of mutilating my flesh. I ferociously pulled on my catheter causing me to bleed and started using the bloody secretions of my genitals as lubricant to continue my depraved experiments...in that moment I discovered that pain is the purest and most magnificent form of ecstasy known to man. Grant me this moment of clarity as I calm things down and try to control my thoughts in this next passage.  I finally made it back home, a changed man, a better man...I had integrated the evil within me to form a new being of corrupted spirituality. My girlfriend was still living with me, but all she did was cause problems...she never helped to feed me or massage my sore muscles or even attempt to understand the hell I dragged myself through just so I could be able to hold her in my arms and tell her that I�m okay. She betrayed me...she was unfaithful with my friends...she lied to me...she made me out to be a monster incapable of love...so I showed her a monster. One day she kept hitting me in the face and I begged her to stop, I didn�t want to hurt her...but he made me, he told me to command her fear...so I did. I struck her three times in the spine...I almost paralyzed her...but I stopped myself...she cried and hid from me...I didn�t care...I wanted to be left alone. Later I apologized and made it clear that if she didn�t strike me I wouldn�t be inclined to strike her back, seeing as this wasn�t the first time she abused me...I�m surprised I didn�t keep hitting her...but it wasn�t right what I did, I realize that...and I never did it again. She continued with her deceit and unfaithful actions, all the while blaming me for not being kind enough...I felt terrible and emasculated. After two weeks of detoxing from the medication and recovering from the unwarranted physical agony and the mental pain of knowing that the woman I loved despised me for my actions, I finally snapped. I fell to my knees, sobbing like an infant...begging her to end my life. I took my knife...placed the serrated edge to my throat...made her grasp the handle and pleaded with all of my might, �Fucking kill me! I know you want to...I need you to...so be creative!� I wanted her to slowly separate my head from my body so that I could experience my life essence gush from my bloody stump...sadly she refused. How dare she...how dare she keep this joy from me...after all that I�ve done for her! She�s a useless whore! Many lies were told and arguments had, eventually she left...and I moved on, no sense in dwelling on it, right?  You may be asking yourself, �What does any of this fucked up stuff have to do with sleep?!� Well, let me tell you. I�m not sure if any of this really happened or if I�m still on that cold steel slab waiting to be cut...so does it really matter what you think if you�re just a figment of my imagination? If you are real, then listen closely to what I say. The dreams in which you are happy...those are to be remembered fondly and thought about often..they are what make living even more beautiful. The dreams in which you are frightened...those are meant to be warnings...your brain is trying to tell you something, so pay close attention. The dreams in which you are suffering...those are mine. I belong to the darkest recesses of your mind...I am the shadows writhing in the corners of your vision...extending my fiendishly sensual tendrils into your soul...tainting your morals and contorting your perception of reality. I am your anguish, your fear, your desire...I am what you are destined to become. I know it seems complicated, you think pain is bad...you think it is to be avoided...by doing this you miss out on the wisdom it brings...you must try to understand this concept. To understand me is to understand yourself...and to understand yourself is to understand pain.TL;DR Pain is a brutal and wise teacher. Without it we cannot understand the beauty life has to offer.

So laying in bed right now at 2:00 am and I just thought back to a sleep over I had at a friends home when I was (9 to 10 can�t remember which) but when I got there his dad told us not to go in to the spare room which from what I was told was storage I was a vary obedient child so did as I was told and did�t well we play video games and with toys like normal kids would do at 10:35 on the dot we were told to go to bed so we did. At 2:28 I walk up from the noise of something being dragged my friends room is at the dead end of the hallway ( pun intended) so you can see the entire hallway to the stairs well I walk to the door and open it I see his father pulling a black bag with tape on it ( I assume it was more then one bag) and had a red Stain where the head would be his father said in a whisper yell voice �get back to bed� I just assumed he was taking out the trash ( I was a vary protected child I didn�t even know the internet was a thing I tell I turned 13 and got adopted due to being abused by my parents) to any one who reads this fare thank you for your time have a nice day/ night

Basically I was over my friends house and we were with these 2 girls. We talked about exploring an abandoned place, so we did. Footsteps were heard n shit, (Also my crush was one of the girls.) and my crush got so scared she hugged my arm. Best day ever



******************************



I�m a 17 year old kid. I had to move to small town in the vary north called Yellowknife. In my first week there I met a kid which I�m gonna call him jack. Me and jack shared a lot of similarities. We both were from the Middle East. And both are ex Muslim. And we both love skating. And a day after a day we start to hang out more and more. Till we started to hangout basically everyday. We started to smoke weed together, and we always smoked together. One summer he got really suicidal and tried to kill him self multiple times (about 4 times) last summer. But he is alive because of me. I kept calling him and talked to him out and shit. He didn�t have a place to live for 2 weeks that time so he lived at my place. And after that he never got a job and I broke my kneecap so I couldn�t get money to get are weed. And I put my relationship with my parents just to buy us weed. He didn�t had to do anything. In fact I got him all the weed he smoked last summer. And let him smoke at my room even tho my parents are really religious and are really against weed or any drug. And when school started and my knee healed. We found some low life that are down to give us some free weed whenever we ask. And we kept going with them and smoke all their weed. And one of these low life a girl I�m gonna call Emma. If you wanna know something about her. She is a  hoe, her dad sells crack, her mom is homeless, he sister sell crack, her cousin sell crack, her uncle is on the run because of crack, and his jaw is broken and you can see it hanging because he fell while he was running and broke it. Basically her entire family are homeless, crack heads or dealers, and alcoholics. Day after a day jack starts to hangout with that group more and more. He starts to smoke a lot of weed with them. Until one day. He starts to date Emma for some reason. He thought it will be a good relationship. But that relationship made him lose ares. And what would you expect from someone with a family like that. Someone that you can trust or love?. I don�t know what he was thinking not gonna lie. Jack did everything he can for Emma. Literally everything. He stopped hanging out with us as much and hang with her more. She is a drop out so he skipped school to meet her. And now he probably won�t graduate. If she asked him to jump off a bridge. He for sure will do it. With no hesitation. But if he did any little mistake she won�t talk to him anymore for the rest of the day. And that make him depressed and he want to die. One time he forgot his phone with a friends car and didn�t get it for a week. And he wanted to meet with her. So he told her to come to the library after school. I had to go to work after school and then to my house. After 3 hours I finished work and went back home. Then I heard a knock on the door. And who do you think it was. It was jack. He said she didn�t come and was wondering if he can stay a lil at my place. And me being the good friend I let him over and not even 5 minutes later he asked to call her. And guess where were she. She was at her friend house the entire time and didn�t give him an explanation why she didn�t come to the library. But one day she asked him to go to the library and he was late for 5 minutes. And I�m not even joking. For 5 minutes and she didn�t even wanna talk to him the entire day. Not like she was gonna go soon anyway too. We stayed at the library like all day. And that was just an example of their relationship. But when shit hit the fan is when Emma was sleeping at jacks place. Jack asked her if she wanted to shower with him. Remember that she said no. He asked her if she was sure and she said that she didn�t want to and feel back asleep. So he went to take a shower. When he finished he went back to her and she started to play with his hair. She felt that is was wet and figured that he took a shower. She was really mad and asked him if he took a shower without her. He told her that he asked her if she wanted to take a shower with him and that she said no. She was yelling at him and told him that she was half asleep and that he should�ve waited for her. She was so mad she wanted to leave his house but he tried to stop her. So she decided to PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE. He got really mad and told her to leave. She started to cry and told him that she was really sorry and asked him to stay. For some reason he decided to let her stay. And if you thought that was fucked wait till you hear what happens next. She was singed in her Facebook in jacks phone. Jack sees two Messages from a man from the US that he never heard about. He opens her phone (she fell asleep again) goes to her Messages in Facebook and opens that guys Messages. And he read the following. Hay Emma I been planning for are future together when are you gonna come. I don�t care send me money for clothes. I would but I don�t have money right now. I don�t care send me money or no pictures. Ya you read it right. By the way she is 15 and that guy is 40. So my friend jack wakes her up and ask her about him. And she started to cry and told him that she was getting money so she can buy him some shoes for his birthday. But he had enough and he broke up with her and kicked her out. But that�s not it tho. After a week or two he starts to talk again with Emma and try�s to go back together. Me and some other friends were trying to tell him not to but he won�t listen. And after that he got kicked out because for some obvious reasons his dad didn�t want her to date her and he told him before he would kick him out if wants to stay with her but he thought the love they had was too big. I offered him to stay at my place for few nights so he can study and go to school. And he said that he would but he will stay at someone else�s for another night then come to my place. But guess what. He didn�t come to my place or tell me he wasn�t gonna come. He went to Emma�s place after a week or two after he caught her selling the nudes. And that�s not the worst. The day after that he goes to another friends house and spend the night. After that I was like fuck this friendship. If he wanted me he won�t treat me like this. Now I�m just gonna ghost him and ignore him. I don�t want him just like he don�t want me

I hugged her.I hated her.The girl with tears streaming down her face sat crumpled on the floor before me, dejected.She was supposed to be my best friend. I hated her.It had been an emotional night. Thinking back, I couldn�t remember what had triggered her emotional outburst. I couldn�t remember exactly how the threads of conversation had twisted and turned until the knot of emotion in this girl�s heart had been revealed. Maybe it had been a joke that had hit too close to home. I don�t know whether it was my personality, my sense of humor, or just the twisted sense of satisfaction I got when I made people squirm, but I had always been good at making jokes that hit a bit too close to home. Jokes that would make people laugh in the moment, then lay awake at night wondering just how much truth there was to it. Jokes about the very things that kept me up at night.It didn�t matter what had led us to this point, all that mattered was that we were here. And I hated it. Hated her.I held her in my arms a moment longer before finally letting go.It should have been the other way around. I should have been the one being held. If only she weren�t so weak, it would have been me.She had said the same thing herself; that she was weak, that she was embarrassed, that she didn�t want to be seen this way.She wiped tears from her eyes, undoubtedly trying to erase the memories of the last few hours, from both her mind and ours.There was another girl there, though only a year older than me and my �best friend,� she was a motherly figure. Mature. Wise. It was impossible to imagine that she had ever gone through the same troubles that had brought the other girl to tears.Though, of course, she had. They all had. Still were. Some problems you never really get over.I was the same, of course. Still am. I put on a mask, but inside I was no different than the others.All humans are the same; scared. Scared of being alone. Scared of the unknown. Scared of the dark.We try so hard to live our lives in the light, sheltered. We hide. We hide behind our parents. We hide behind our friends. We hide behind our teachers, bosses, government. We do anything we can to hide behind labels and conceal others under the same. Anything to avoid seeing the truth. The truth is dark.My �friend� was getting hugged again, this time by the motherly figure. She was speaking to her again, with that firm but loving voice that I so longed to hear. My face concealed the hatred I felt.I felt like I had spent my whole life walking a lit path in the darkness. There was nothing but inky blackness all around me, no stars, no fires, no man-made lights.I pressed on, not through any desire of my own, but because it was what I was expected to do. As soon as I passed a bit of path, whatever ethereal, unseen light source that had kept it lit winked out, and I was left slowly fleeing from an ever-encroaching darkness.I wasn�t alone on the path, on occasion I would pass another, on occasion another would pass me. Sometimes they walked off into the darkness, never to be seen again. Most of the time they just pressed on in the same monotonous slog that I was trapped in.One girl had traveled with me longer than anyone else, neither passing nor being passed. She still knelt on the floor before me.Eventually we reached the end of the path. Darkness stretched out before and behind us. To the sides as well. Only the small square we stood on remained lit.It winked out.We both knew what we had to do.I stepped forward, intending to proceed as I always had. She, surprising me, jumped.When I was young I had feared the dark. I would make my parents leave my bedroom door open at night, with a light on in the hallway. I made them get me a night light. Eventually it got so bad that after they had tucked me into bed I would get up and turn the light back on. I got really good at sleeping with the light on.After that had gone on a long time my father sat me down and told me that people don�t fear the dark, not really. They fear what lurks in the dark. He told me that it was okay, though, because if there was nothing there in the light then there would be nothing there in the dark.The words that had comforted me as a child terrified me as an adult because, in that last moment before the light had winked out and I had been forced to step into darkness, I had looked around and seen exactly what I had most feared.Nothing.I fell.I tried to scream in the darkness, but it was pointless. In this void there was no air, nothing that I could fashion into a scream.I looked up and saw a tiny pinprick of light. My �friend�s� jump had been successful, she now stood on a newly lit platform just a few feet forward and a few inches higher from where the last one had ended. And I hated her for it.I kept falling and soon that pinprick of light had completely faded. All was dark.If only I had the strength to cry.

This was about 6 years ago, my mom and I travelled from our hometown to where my dad lived. For work reason and being far my dad decided to bring us with him but in summer we could visit our family . The bus ride is about 18 hrs long and sometimes longer. It was 3 of us at the time so either i sat with my brother or i would sit with some stranger. One of the times was as i mentioned 6 tears ago and my mom was happy about visiting my grandmother, a lady she knew was in the bus so they shared seats for a bit before coming to us back again. I was soiting with this stranger ill call him Tim .( in the end i cant remember his name) Tim was nice and asking us thing about where we lived, i wasnt answering much tbh. My mom sat back and Tim tried to get convo going. Sure it was a long trip but man was he insisting.  My mom kept getting woken up by his questions and efforts to get a convo. We got off at a rest spot and got some things from the vending machines. I get back up in the bus and guess who brought my mom alot of snacks? Tim was full of small bags of candy trying to give them to her. She declined as she pointed that we had already bought some. He insisted alot. Halfway through the trip he would get up and offer drinks to us At some point he tried to flirt but my mom didnt want any of that. I was little sure but i could hear her said no bc shes a married woman not about to cheat or anything. He insisted but in the end my mom got annoyed and asked him to stop. The rest of the trip there wasnt any comments from Tim and his stop came he got off and wished us a safe trip. We never saw him again on the other trips we had. Just sharing this bc i felt like Thanks for reading:)

i used to live in  San Francisco  California  when i was 9 years old in 2011 i used to have a friend called Emily , she was 9 but i was 2 months older . now i was a very mature kid i understood when we were in danger and what i had to do , one day i was invited to Emily's birthday so i went to visit Emily her ''mother''  welcomed me into the house , when i entered her house i noticed that nobody was in the house except a drunk man sleeping on the couch looking at the TV and a stage like piano it was big but not huge , i was excited since i loved playing a piano and listened to people playing a piano mainly my favorite was  F�r Elise" by Beethoven , i asked Emily's mother "who can play on that piano" she answered with a "nobody" with a huge creepy smile on her face  i was shocked since i realized that this isnt Emily's mother , i only noticed this when i saw her creepy smile on her very pale face . i RAN to the door then i fell down and the women locked the door so i stood and ran up the stairs . i couldn't do anything since i was a young child and she was more powerful so i ran up found a room with an opened door i ran as fast as i could and fortunately there was a lock in the door i ran into the room and locked the door i took like 30 seconds to regain my breathe "i was still young" when i looking at the back of the room i saw a bed with someone sleeping on it , i pulled the blanket and saw a little girl with like 3 bruises on her legs and covered with scars then i quickly realized that her parents are insane and abusive i quickly woke her up and opened the window and shouted "HELP HELP" many people saw me and did nothing except one old man who knew the parents are insane so he called the cops , meanwhile the women tried entering the room by kicking down the door fortunately she couldn't do it because their doors were heavy and couldn't be broken into easily so i used her own house against her . i waited for 5 minutes until the cops arrived and called the ambulance to get this little poor girl some help . the cops held a party for me because apparently the people were wanted criminals and i a little kid solved a mystery none of the cops could solve . the sheriff praised me and told me i had a bright future ahead of me and told me not to waste it i laughed and left . i later asked  my mom about the man who was laying on the couch and she told me the man was arrested . i grew up to be a praised detective.

So, the other day, at high school, my friends threw my hat away from me as a joke (we have a thing where my friends try to steal my hat).Naturally, since I was sitting down, I leaned back to get my hat.However, some twelfth graders were passing by, and I accidentally bumped my head into one of their calves.Before I could say sorry the guy who I bumped into called me a sexist.



******************************



I bought a dildo and a fleshlight from the same store today and when I got home, I inserted the dildo into the fleshlight and removed it. I kept repeating this. At this point, I was essentially imitating sex. I got bored after 4 minutes.

So me and my grandfather are at my great grandparents house in Florida. Both of them have passed a couple of years ago. On our way down we stopped at the cemetery to see them. We both put dimes on the headstones we always see dimes around randomly and think it�s a sign. So 5 minutes ago I go to sit on the couch and me and my grandfather hear a coin drop. We looked under the couch and found a coin. Not  any coin.  Not even a dime. But a coin I�ve never seen before. A gold colored coin with an angel on both signs. No date just the coin. Me and him are going to scratch lottery tickets so I hope it brings us good luck. Thanks for listening to my story.

So I was in middle school when this happened. I didn�t understand why I was being bullied. Honestly I had never met the kid and the fact he was bullying anyone at all was insane. (He was a slightly taller dwarf) nonetheless we were in class and it began simply enough he would shove my books onto the floor or pull my bag off me when I was waking down the hall which I didn�t care much about. I mean annoying yes but my folks always told me to never hit first. So one day ironically enough we were watching some gang movie that was supposed to teach us that fighting was never the answer to anything. Literally at the fight scene (which I was looking extremely forward to) he comes up behind me and punches me in the back of the head. I told him to back off and he just laughed. Again he snuck up behind me and punched me. I told him he had one last chance to which he responded to by slapping me. I punched him in the nose then threw a wild punch to the side of his face and ended it by chock slamming him into the floor. Immediately the teacher ran up and pulled us both out of the classroom. A few minutes later 2 school officials came to take us to the principals office. We both sat next to each other in her office where she had us explain what happened which only I got to tell my side. When I told her about him bullying me she immediately ripped into the bully just unbelievably yelling at him and berating him. He burst into tears and she just turned to me with a big warm smile and said �you�re not in any trouble sweetie you can go back to class� then proceeds to yell and him. Later I find out he was suspended for the week. I spent most of my middle school experience trying to figure out what had happened that day. Towards our last few weeks of my being in middle school I found out that the reason she was so angry was because her nephew was bullied and he had killed himself months before we ended up in her office. I felt really bad for her after that it was really sad to find that out. I�m pretty sure she was replaced because of the way she handled bully complaints/fights (she would punish bullies without prejudice) but honestly after she left I shit you not suicide rates spiked and fighting incidents went through the roof. When I was in high school looking at the freshmen coming it was crazy! Once I hit my senior year I found out a cop got stabbed in the middle of one of our fights and someone got knocked out with a stool in the cafeteria. It was an absolute mad house! It�s crazy to think how once person kept so much in check. I�ll miss her. I�ve forgotten her name but I do know she was Puerto Rican and she was the toughest yet kindest lady I�ve ever met.

My 2 year old brother had pooped his diaper my mom then said to him Eeewwww you pooped? In a high pitched voice. He then screamed No I didn't! And ran away. That was his first sentence. My brother's first sentence. Was a rebuttal.

TL;DR at end.For context, my dad has the [Bose noise-cancelling headphones](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html?mc=25_PS_HP_PL_00_GO_&gclid=Cj0KCQiA68bhBRCKARIsABYUGif51MP80EoS08F5kQ9wkdn1z4_ZpJVbXx7L8HQsjTHXRbuVxIhzpp0aArFGEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds#v=qc35_ii_silver) that I've been borrowing the past few days. They  connect to my phone if I turn them on, but if his phone is in range they'll connect to his automatically, which hadn't been a problem seeing as we were in different places last night.So, this morning, my dad had come back from a party he had been at all night. He went into his room in my cousin's house and closed the door. I wanted to listen to music on the headphones, and I assumed he would be sleeping, therefore his phone wouldn't connect to them.Alas, that was not the case. Imagine my confusion when instead of my music I heard moaning. I quickly realized what was happening and turned the headphones off. I sat for a minute, horrified, trying to decide whether to laugh or cry. This was cut short when my dad texted me asking for the WiFi password. I realized the sound of the video must have cut out when I accidentally connected to the his phone. I'm internally cringing at this point. I can't even react externally because my sister and cousin are sitting right next to me. This is the actual worst.That was probably the most embarrassing experience of my entire life. TL;DR: my dad has headphones I was borrowing, which connected to his phone while he was watching porn. I died a little inside.

This happened over a decade ago while I was in middle school. Halo 3 had just come out and my friend and his little brother got it for Christmas. I went over to their apartment and knocked on their door. Their parents weren�t home but the brothers told me they were grounded so they couldn�t play. I said ok and was about to leave when my friend (the older brother) told me just to come inside for a little and play a couple rounds of halo. We were playing our second round when his mom came in through the front door. We were in his parents� room because that�s where the TV and Xbox were (they didn�t have a tv in their living room). It was the master bedroom of the apartment so it had its own full bathroom. We hear her in the living room screaming her lungs out because we forgot to lock the front door. Out of fear of being scolded and grounded for even longer, my friend hid me behind the shower curtain in the master bathroom. The reason his mom had come home was to watch these men who were coming over to fix their washer and dryer. I was in the shower for four hours. But that�s not the worst part. The mom came into the bathroom three times: once, to fill something with water from the sink and the next to wash her hands. After the second time she had come in I thought she was finished but she came in one last time and this time she closed the door. My heart sank. There are times in a person�s life when they can just *feel* death. Where they know they fucked up. I could almost hear my heartbeat as I stood motionless behind the shower curtain. The sound of her belt unbuckling... the sound of a zipper being pulled down. I�m not gonna say I wanted to die but I will say that at that moment in time, death may have seemed like the better option. She sits down on the toilet and in my head I�m like �please be number 1�. And it was. And I was slightly relieved. But she didn�t stand up and I didn�t hear her grab toilet paper from the roller. Then I heard the plop. I knew at that moment I could either stay the fuck still or book it. I moved my leg a little bit and a shampoo bottle fell. I felt her pulling the shower curtain back (she was still sitting on the toilet). What happens next is one of the clearest memories of my childhood. It might as well have happened in slow motion. I turned around and jumped out of the shower. His mom screamed. And I could swear (but maybe it was just my imagination) that I heard a small plop as I looked her straight in the eyes before running out of the apartment. I was never allowed over at my friend�s place again but his parents were nice enough to still let him chill outside with me. We�re still friends to this day and his mom even said hi to me the last time I went back home to visit.

My past experiences with pot have been nothing to write home about. It appeared that, no matter how much I smoked, it had very little impact on me. I had the usual sleepiness and hunger related symptoms commonly joked about, but nothing like this. Yesterday, I had to drive one of my old coworkers to their shift. He's also my drug dealer, and has been my exclusive source of pot ever since I started smoking it. I've never had a problem with anything he's given me, so when he offered to give me something before we left his house, I happily agreed. That's when we revealed he was giving me a dab. For those who may not know, a dab is an extremely potent form of pot, containing over ten times the amount of THC compared to "regular" forms of pot. I didn't realize this as he prepared the rig, and before I knew it, I had taken a hit. The amount he gave me was incredibly small, especially when compared to the hit he had taken right after me. As we walked over to the car, I felt the same way I always feel after smoking; a little bit of chest pain, a little dizziness. I figured I could handle the high, but I was very wrong.So, I started to drive my coworker to his shift. I had done this so many times before, and I thought this would be nothing different. About five minutes later, the real high kicked in. Time began to completely change around me, and the best way to describe it is like this: Imagine that every 5 steps you took forward, you took 4 steps back, then completely forgot what you were doing by the time you made it back to where you were. Then, the cycle quickly repeats. It was as if time was stopping, then progressing forwards for a second, then stopping again. I quickly felt as though I had no idea where I was, and I felt like I kept saying the same thing over and over again. I was stuck in a constant time loop which jumped forwards little by little, and my brain completely flipped out. I had a massive panic attack, so scared that time would "snap" forwards and my coworker and I would be dead. I lost all sense of time and space, I had no clue where I was, if I was moving or not, if I was alone... It was the first time in my life where I experienced true fear. I have never been more terrified, and I still feel the waves of panic over 24 hours later. Driving to school today was horrifying, and I was expecting my brain to start panicking at any second. Even writing this I can feel the panic coming and going. My mind is a mess.I hate to sound like a buzzkill or whatever, but please stay away from this stuff. I wouldn't wish that experience on my worst enemy. I don't think I'll be smoking or drinking for a long time. I have a new look on life, and I won't be taking anything for granted anymore. It may sound cheesy, but it's true. The fear I felt that day will forever haunt me. Please, don't do what I did. It's one of my biggest regrets in life, and I've done a lot wrong.

Whilst on a binge of Ask Reddit videos; I stumbled upon one asking people: "What was the biggest scandal at your high school?" and it made me want to talk about an incident that occurred during my high school days. However, it's a little long winded and the moment to reply to said question has kinda passed; so I thought i'd just share it here instead. Enjoy?&#x200B;Currently, I am 23 and heading to university. This took place in high school; around 6 years ago. I'm from a "small town" area in which education here is considered "third world" by universities as I found out whilst applying to mine. The high school I attended was (and I think still is) considered the best out here. I could go on a list of things wrong with this high school (more than willing if anyone wants), but I have a specific instance I want to shed light on:&#x200B;Two girls (lets call them L and R; their initials) were the dictionary definition of spoiled bimbos: they were blond, fake tanned, came from rich families and believed they were entitled to anything because of their "perfect" breasts (feels creepy saying this now, but hopefully you get the idea). The way they saw it; you were privileged to be in their presence. I think they'd actually charge people to take pictures on Instagram with them; they'd walk up to YOU, snap a pic and then put their hand out expecting change for said transaction. This happened to me once and I just walked away...&#x200B;I use the word bimbos because these two girls...were thick as shit. Something which will become evident later on.&#x200B;Case and point: these two girls wanted to be actresses, but didn't see the need to put effort in because their parents were: "rich and had connections" they were also failing English and math HARD! Apparently there had been trouble in paradise, because these girls suddenly became very desperate to get at least C grades in both subjects days after a teacher had rowed with them and threatened to call their parents. They were not improving and started to panic as exams were months away.&#x200B;I'm not sure how many schools were aware of this, but a rumor went around that: "If a girl gives birth during the exam, everyone passes" To this day I am convinced that this was spread by teens as a poor attempt to get laid. But of course, guess which two dumb sluts thought this was true?&#x200B;So you're probably thinking: oh man, did they get pregnant just to pass an exam? Yes, but there is so much more to it:&#x200B;These girls were cheerleaders (go figure) who went with the football team to matches. Some of these matches would be over seas because again: we were located in the middle of butt fuck nowhere and thus everything was over on the mainland. L,R and a third girl comprised our entire cheer-leading unit and said third girl was unable to go. They would stay in overnight accommodation across the water for 4 days.&#x200B;As you can probably imagine: they fucked an entire team in hopes of getting pregnant. But it wasn't with our team: it was the team ours had gone to play against. Apparently they did this because they feared rumors getting spread had they slept with anyone at our school. I would come to befriend a guy who was on said other team at the time a year after this controversy came to a head and he had even participated in these impregnating orgies. I remember him being like: "Oh fuck, it's R!" as we saw her from a distance across the street and I curiously responded: "you know R?". He would then later reminisce to me the following:&#x200B;On the night of the first day, he and the team were just shooting the shit and watching YouTube on their phones. Their "coach" (I think that's what their position would be called) had gone to the pub with the other coaches. Then suddenly, L and R come in along with the remaining 8 players (each room had 4 beds so it was 10 players and 2 reserves) my friend said these guys were grinning from ear to ear with the occasional chuckle (probably at how ludicrous this situation was). My friend obviously asked what was going on and R made her way over to him, crouched down and started running her hands across his inner thighs. She then looked up and said in what he describes as a seductive tone: "we have a  proposition for you guys"&#x200B;He described everything after that like being in a PornHub video: for the next 3 nights, they would have orgies. He said they only lasted an hour tops, but fuck what an hour: In a weirdly considerate gesture (something L and R were not known for doing) they offered anal and blow jobs to the guys awaiting their turn. There was apparently a point where R was sucking my friends dick, while getting it in the front and back and when the guy in the front finished she pulled herself away to say "okay, next one; come on guys, lets go! Lets go!!" and butt guy would then become pussy guy with another member talking butt guys place.&#x200B;They apparently had multiple sessions for two reasons: to "make sure they got pregnant" and because it was part of a deal to let our team win if they kept doing this for the remaining nights they'd be staying (to clarify: they thought they were doing our team a favor; treated it like they were so noble) and wouldn't you know it: our team won by a country mile. Apparently a handful of guys ended up cheating on their girlfriends at home as a result of these orgies. I said "that's kinda shitty of them" and my friend replied: "Well to be fair; if you were like 16/17 and 2 hot girls with big tits came to your room and said: hey? wanna fuck?? Would you turn them down?" I acknowledged it as a good point, though still scummy. He said that no one wanted to be "that one pussy who didn't join in" I guess I could see peer pressure being an issue.&#x200B;Apparently there was a guy on the team who was big,swole and black guy called Nick who wanted L to be (in his own words) "his bitch"; I swear this is not a porn; this happened. On the last night someone asked why they were still doing this since the game was over and L mentioned they were trying to get pregnant. Nick then apparently picked her up and said: "You wanna get pregnant? Come here!" and proceeded to go to town on L on top of one of the beds (he says he's thankful it wasn't his bed). My friend said he didn't know who had it worse that night: L who was getting destroyed by Nick or R who was still offering "the usual services" to the now 11 players.&#x200B;When they got home and back to classes. No one knew about their plan yet but they had gone back to not paying attention in class and whenever the point of "you need to pass" was brought up they just laughed it off with no explanation. Eventually word got out (I don't remember who found out). They were pregnant and it was starting to show. Multiple rumors and stories which were somewhat plausible started to surface and they paint a pretty sad picture. Here are the events I can remember and know about:\-Parents of L and R ask why they got pregnant to which they both give the: If a girl gives birth during the exam reasoning which they were apparently horrified to find out wasn't real.They also got pregnant 4 months before their exams, really hammering home their stupidity.&#x200B;\-Parents apparently plan to get their girls to have an abortion. To which the school objects because it is a catholic school and of course "every sperm is sacred" and so must go through with the birth or be expelled (keep in mind: best education in the area).&#x200B;\-Parents essentially try to hunt down the guys responsible for this and bribe them into a shotgun wedding (i'm iffy on these details) but of course; L and R have no idea which guys are the father. L eventually says Nick is the most likely ( I guess?). She searches for him on social media and tells him her daddy wants them to be together and will pay for him to live with her. Now, you're 17, a girl you like not only wants you, but says her super rich father will pay for everything for now on; GUESS WHAT NICK CHOSE?&#x200B;\-L had twins and R had 1 special needs child; both of these are difficult for competent people to parent, let alone these 2. L is now accompanied by Nick (don't think they're married) and R has had boyfriends but nothing long term and none of them were from the "incident".&#x200B;Probably my most fond memory in retrospect is walking past them on my way into school: big baby bumps and looks of devastation on their face (probably not long after finding out they couldn't have abortions). It still makes me laugh to this day thinking about the situation. Though I feel sorry for the kids having to grow up in these homes.

Norway, Oslo. Night time. Excuse the grammar. We were in my gf�s dorm, with her best friend and two random dudes I just met. They were all 24 and I was 29 years old.The trip started pleasantly, but it didn�t take long for me to feel paranoid. First I started to believe that I was WAY higher than the others, and I couldn�t fight the feeling that they ate brownies without any weed in it. Just to drug me and (maybe) rob me. Important to mention that my gf and I hadn�t been dating for very long.So I sat there, freaking out and started for some reason to believe that my gf was a spy. And that she and her friends were all in on it. My theory was that they were using me as a project or something. They were hired by an agency to use and experiment on me. One �good� reason I suspected she was a spy was because she had very little furniture and clothes in her apartment (that she could easily move out quick and fast if they ever were to be exposed by the government). My gf and her team mates was using me and other poor souls as projects! They were fake girl/boyfriends. I couldn�t fight the feeling that it was true, and I started to feel like Sherlock Holmes since I figured it all out.After three hours, her best friend and the two boys left and me and my gf went to bed. And I started to calm down a little.But I just had to ask her: "baby? Are you a spy?"And because she (obviously) also was high, she didn�t understand wtf I was talking about. So I calmed down a little more. Until i realized that there were no pictures of us together on Facebook, we were not in a relationship on Facebook (like she didn�t want the world to know that I existed), I never saw her go to school and she always had a lot of cash laying around (birthday/Christmas presents). And THEN I remembered a news article I read earlier that day. The article was about fake Facebook girlfriends who had been robbing men for millions of norwegian kroners (NOK)! And I recently gave her a extra set of keys to my apartment. So I snapped. I jumped out of bed and took on my clothes. I was convinced that the people we took brownies with earlier was in my apartment now and robbing it for everything of value.My gf asked wtf I was doing, but I couldn�t talk because the weed paralyzed my mouth (but I thought of course that they had drugged me with some sort of mouth-sedative).So I ran down to the streets, got into a taxi and managed to give the cab driver my address.So while we were driving, I felt he looked at me in a funny way. Of course he did, I was high as a kite. But then he started to tap on the monitor on the dashboard and I was 100% sure that he was calling the police. So when the cab stopped on a red light, I ran out of the car (hearing him screaming after me) and I disappeared into the dark streets of Oslo. So every time I a saw a taxi I had to hide behind parked cars, because I thought every cab driver in Oslo were after me now. And there was a lot of taxies in Oslo that night...When I got to a park, I sat down on a bench. I took up my phone and was about to call the police. To turn my girlfriend in! Send her to jail! But then I realized that I had just ran from a taxi bill. So the cops were probably after ME at this point. So what I did next was the only reasonable thing I could do, I called my mom! She was drunk with som friends and couldn�t understand wth I was talking about. So I hanged up. Then I called my gf and said that I was on to her, and that I was gonna report her to the police. Her response: �Hu.. uuuh?�30 minutes later I got to my apartment building. And out side a taxi was waiting. It looked just like the taxi I ran away from, and I remembered that I gave the driver my home address.So I had to go around the building and climb some fences to get into my flat.No one had been in my flat. Nothing was stolen. And I got really relieved. Suddenly my moms male friend called me on FaceTime (one of the people she was drinking with). He wanted me to explain everything. I told him about the fake Facebook girlfriends who robbed men for millions of NOK. He then asked me if I was high. I said yes. He then asked if I had proof that my gf had robbed me for millions of NOK (money I didn�t even have, of course) and I said no. He then told me to calm the fuck down and just think about how stupid this situation was and go to sleep. That helped, and the trip was already settling down.The next morning my gf came to my apartment with some take away breakfast. She asked what happened to me last night, and I explained everything. We had a good laugh. But I will never do weed brownies again. At least not with her.Summary: took weed brownies with my girlfriend. I started to believe that she was a spy who robbed me of all my money.

OKAY FUNNY STORY TIME: So the other day I�m driving home from school and I stop to get some gas at sheetz. I successfully finished my last final and I�m in a hella good mood. While I�m pulling out, this lady holding a baby with another kid beside her approaches me and motions for me to roll my window down. I comply since generally women holding babies aren�t dangerous characters. She gives me this sob story about her family traveling because her husband finally got a job and her welfare check running out and her being desperate to buy food for her children and yada yada. Her story sounded pretty well rehearsed, and I noticed that she had picked me (the young naive child) out of the whole crowd of people at the gas station. I�m suspicious, but I give her 10 bucks because you never know and it�s just 10 bucks. But yeah something definitely felt off and I didn�t feel good about giving her the money. So next day comes and I�m at my job at LongHorn Steak House (not exactly cheap) working the morning shift (20 miles away from this gas station) and who else but her fat ass walks in. We see each other and I see the most memorable look of �oh fuck shit balls you have to be kidding me Jesus� on her face. On the other hand I�m pretty sure I looked like the Cheshire Cat on his birthday. Me being a host, sits her pathetic ass down and goes off to bus a table and the moment I leave the front of the restaurant she skips town and makes a mad dash out the door. I don�t think that wide grin left my face for an hour. That moment was probably the best thing 10 dollars could ever buy. But anyways Moral of the story: don�t give money to well rehearsed strangers at sheetz.

So I�ve had this internet best friend for 3 years. We�re both in high school and live on the opposite sides of the US. I live in California and he lives in Indiana. One day I came across this girl�s Instagram account by accident.On Instagram it has that bolded text where it shows if any of the ppl u follow, follow this person too. So if showed that there were 3 ppl that I knew following her. Her account was public. These 3 ppl were ppl that went to my high school and graduated last year. I didn�t know them personally, but I knew OF them.  I noticed that her most recent photo was a graduation picture of her in front of MY INTERNET BF�s HIGH SCHOOL. I was shooook. It was a crazy coincidence that ppl from MY high school were following a girl that went to HIS high school. A random high school in Indiana? What are the odds of THAT? There�s over a billion high schools in the US. What a small word we live in.

We were taking a piss break on a sandbar scoping out a group of hot sorority looking chicks canoeing past us when one of them shouted "nice tan" to my friend.  Big mistake.  He's almost-but-not-quite an albino, and he's very sensitive about it.  Being that we were at least a 12 pack each into the Natty Light, instinct took over and he turned and whipped down his swim trunks, bent over, and let out a huge, spattering natty light beer fart right in their direction.  He's also the the type that can swallow air and let out epic belches, so he turned around, tackle out, swinging to and fro, and started swallowing air, belching loudly at them.  The girls were screaming at him until they turned the bend, He continued belching, I almost died of both embarrassment and laughter.  I convinced him to pull up his drawers and wait a good while before heading back out on the river so that we wouldn't encounter them again.  The end.

NSFWFair warning. This is long. But I hope you enjoy and please feel free to DM or comment. Beth and I had only know each other for two months. We meet in the cafeteria of the college we attended. A story which is better from her side of things. ��But here is the Quick and Dirty of it.I had been very forward and asked if she wanted to join a group of my friends to go see a movie. This being the first time I had ever spoken to her, I was surprised that she agreed.Unfortunately, she had brought her boyfriend along. �Of course she has a boyfriend, you fucking idiot.� I told myself. �Look at her, she�s awesome���They didn�t seem like a good match. But I wasn�t sure if that�s just what I wanted to see. For all I knew they could be perfect. I did my best to hide my feelings. Going as for as pretending to be interested in another. I had even taken her on a date, on Valentines day. It didn�t work out.Beth was super supportive. We had became great friends over the last few weeks. Spending most of our time together. She was an enigma. Switching back and forth from sweet and helpful, to tough as nails and solitary. I must admit, I was enamored with her. There were many rumors about her. Some adorable, others... not so much. I didn�t care one way or another. I thought she was amazing.Something about her clawed at the back of my brain. I wanted to spend every moment with her. One night, a few of us broke into a computer lab, to use the projector in the room. Beth and I were the tech savvy ones of the group. And we work very well together.Kyle, Beth�s boyfriend, had not been there that evening. He was somewhat antisocial, and did not attend the college. We spent hours in there watching movies. Slowly one by one. Our friends turned in for the night. Which I couldn�t blame them. I was exhausted, but Beth was still here. And I just wanted to be near her.It came down to just three of us. Having no more movies to watch. We chatted, talking about each other�s past. Childhood, Exes, Embarrassing Moments, and sexual experiences. Terry and Beth both being women, were very open and compared stories. I simply sat there awkwardly. Not because sex talk made me uncomfortable, but because listening to Beth talk about such things. And as a result, me thinking about those things. With her. Made things, Difficult.Also I didn�t have anything to contribute. Really only having one girlfriend before. �Who did give me a blowjobs, when ever we got a moment alone. But it never progressed pass that. I would offer to return the favor.� I shrugged continuing to tell them the only sexual experiences I had ever had. �But she didn�t even let me touch her under her clothes.� �Wait, so... your a virgin?� Beth asked me �I mean, yea. I guess so.� I said shyly. Now I was really embarrassed.�Huh� She said. Looking at me suspiciously.She turned back to Terry and began to talk about me. They both talked about what features they like about me. The way I looked and my body. Now I was even more awkward. She stood walking passed me. Going to the desk where she had left her water. As she did. One of her fingers lightly traced my arm. It was dark in the room and Terry didn�t seem to notice. �She is messing with you, now.� I thought to myself. �Great. She thinks I am a lame virgin, and is trying to get a response out of me�As she came back she ran a hand through my hair. Pausing, running her fingers through it again and exclaim,�Terry! Check this out! His hair is super soft.� �Oh yea?� Terry questioned standing, and walking over. She began to touch my hair too�They are both just messing with me. What the heck�I didn�t know what to do. But after a moment Terry stopped and we all began to discuss hair treatment. And how we took care of our own. Beth was still running her fingers through my hair. Still standing behind me. �She. Is. Just. Messing. With. You.� I told myself.But god damn it did it feel great. I had to reposition the way I was sitting for, reasons.Terry left to use the bathroom for a moment. Suddenly Beth�s lips were close to my ear, her breath warm against my neck.�Do you like that?� She whispered. It sent chills down my spine. And I was throbbing.�What game is she playing. She has never shown interest in me and has a boyfriend� I thought. �She�s not into you. She is fucking messing with you.��It�s fine I guess. Kinda like brushing it, without having to do it yourself. You know?� I said trying my best to be cool.She moved her fingers from my hair, down my neck, to my shoulders. �You have really big shoulders.�She continued down my arms. �And really big arms.� She whispered her lips touching my ear now.Try as I might. I began to breathe heavily. Deep steady breaths. Beth was still standing behind me, running her hands over my arms and chest.I couldn�t help but tighten my muscles as she did. And she noticed.�Oh, very very nice.� She whispered in My ear. I was about to reach behind me. And began touching her, maybe play with her hair. But right before I moved she stood up straight. Still tracing her fingers along my arms as she did. She walked around to the front of me. She stood there. Over me. For a moment, we locked eyes. She was biting her lip. And then Terry came back into the room. The room was dark and I don�t think terry notice I was blushing bright red. Beth sat back down in her chair. Still looking at me.Terry began the conversation again. Sitting back down. We chatted for a while longer. I was flustered and confused.�Had it all been a game?� I thought. �She was just messing with me, right?  Just trying to get a rise out of me?�After a while Terry sat up straight. �Oh shit!� She yelled. Beth and I were startled. We both looked at each other guiltily. �I got a paper due in like 5 hours!� She grabbed her backpack and started to tidy up. We all cleaned up the computer lab together. Locking the door behind us. Terry said her goodbyes and trotted out the building. Beth and I stood in the hall way for a moment. Not looking at each other, staring after Terry. What felt like an hour passed. I was about to speak. �So...� I began. She reached out and took my hand. Her hands were so delicate, and soft.I stopped talking as she did. She looked at my hand for a moment then walked away toward the other room across the hall. The Art Lab.She held my hand just long of enough. To make it seem like she was leading me with her.She reached the door looking back at me as she did, a smirk on her face. Her cheeks were rosey and her lips pink. She looked me up and down. Then stepped into the art lab letting the door close behind her.I stood there. Confused. I didn�t know what was going on. I mean. I knew what I wanted to be going on. But... �No, it can�t be... could it?�I acted, trying not to think too much. I followed her in. The Art Lab was a large room. With huge windows to let in natural light. They had a ledge that started waist high and extended all the way to the ceiling, some 15 feet up. There she was. Gracefully walking on the ledge, stepping from window to window. Her silhouette beautiful in the moon light. She looked toward me. �So, what would you like to do now.� She asked. �It�s late,� looked at the clock on the wall behind me. �4:30 in The morning.��Yea, I guess we have been hanging out a while.� I said, watching her. �Did you want to continue with what we were doing earlier?� She asked, hopping of the ledge and walking over to me.�I... I don�t know.� I lied. Of course I wanted to. She reach up to me head running her fingers through it again. �Did you not enjoy it?� She askedI couldn�t lie anymore. I couldn�t take it anymore. If she was going to toy with me like this. Play with my emotions like this. I would do the same.�Yea,� I said. I reach for her hair and began to comb its soft red tendrils. �Do you like it?� I asked.She sighed softly, sweetly. Stretching her neck as she did. She had a pretty red scarf around it. She pulled my face close to hers. So close. And began to run her hand down my neck and shoulders once more. I did the same. I could  she smell her. Something sweet, something feral.She reach under my arm gripping the back of my ribs and pulling me in even closer. I had moved my hands to her hips. They were prefect. Beautifully curved. I leaned in and breathed in at her neck. Burying my face in that red scarf. She place her head on my shoulder. Breathing me in. And she kissed my neck.I lost control. I pulled her in tightly. Kissing her neck. We were feeling ever inch of each other now. She threw a leg around my hips. I wasn�t excepting it, and lost my balance. We fell backwards, laughing as we did.She was hovering over my lap now. We looked at each for a moment. She relaxed sitting on me. I didn�t notice that I was rock hard. Until she sat on me. And she gasped. As did I. We both still fully clothed. �Oh my god.� She said startled.�I�m sorry... I� I started to say. About to get up.�No, no, no.� she said pleading. Making me stay seated.She put all of her weight on my lap. She began to rock her hips against me. I had never done this before and had no idea what to do. I just went with it. Letting her take control. I leaned back, hands behind me. So she could have more room. Get close to me. She gasped and gasped. Rocking, grabbing my hair.She went faster and faster.  Then she let out a yelp, digging into me. Pulling me close and kissing me on the lips. A few second later she pushed me away. Scrambled across the floor backwards. Shock across her face.�What�s wrong? Are you ok? Did I hurt you?� I panicked. I had not idea what just happened. She trembled in waves. Saying nothing. I didn�t move at all. In awe of what was happening not wanting to scare her away. Her eyes rolled back as she closed them and pointed her face to the ceiling. Arching her back as she did. Still waves of shakes and quivers washing over her.After a moment she looked back down at me. Both our eyes wide. �Are... you ok?� I managed. She looked at me, for a long moment. �Yeeea...� she responded. Stretching out he word. �I�m good.� She squinted her eyes at me.�What?� I asked nervously.�Do you know what just happened?� She questioned.Still panicking I crawled backwards putting distance between us. �I hurt you didn�t I? I�m so sorry... I�She crawled toward me place a finger on my lips. �No silly. I just came. Through both our pants.� She looked down. �Jeans no less��Oh... that�s... that�s... good?��Yea it was great.� She smiled at me. Those blue eye intense.That was the the 1st time I had made her come, anyone come for that matter. And it was like a drug. I wanted to do this with her, for her... Forever.

This is a true story with me(17M), my crush(16F), and our other friend(17M). Okay lets hope I don't get judged personally too much for this one.Anyways, last night was my school's homecoming football game and I was going with this girl I've been talking to, and our other friend. We're hanging out, all having a good time, but we decide to leave the croud early and go to the nearby empty baseball field. We get out in the middle of the field and just sit down, I'm sitting next to this girl and our other homie is sitting a few feet in front of us. This girl and I are hitting my dab pen to get high and just vibe to music. Our other friend doesn't smoke though, so he's completely sober.It's late and dark outside, but we're in a very populated area with a lot of lights. We're all looking up at the dim and few stars we see just totally chilling. All of the sudden this girl next to me says outload "do you see guys that?", I look over and there's two very bright, perfectly lined up "stars". They were too far apart to be a airplane, but they weren't separated enough to be different stars- if that makes sense.All of us see it and we're kind of just confused at first; then boths "stars" at the same exact time started moving and just slowly dimmed out. From when we first saw it to when they were gone, it had probably been only 30 seconds.After is was completely gone we all just started freaking out. Before this night I didn't believe in aliens, or advanced unordinary spaceships, but after that happened I have absolutely no explanation but a UFO. And no it was not a satellite because the lights were way too bright in that area. I'm still confused and completely in awe. While typing this story I've gotten chills multiple times. What do you guys think?

Dear Zoey, Hey Baby, if you�re reading this, then my employers have probably eliminated me. The past two years with you have been the happiest years of my life, and thank you so much for all you have done for me. Most women wouldn�t willingly stay with, let alone love a hitman... but you are, through everything, still with me. You left the hospital room around five minutes ago, and despite the facial deformities I�ve received, you still kissed me as you always have in our time together. I don�t know how or when I�m going to die... Maybe they will pay a doctor to raise my morphine dose; maybe they�ll have the doctor run a scalpel through my throat. Hell, maybe one of them will just walk in and shoot me in the head. However I die, I just hope you know how much I love you. You are the only reason I�ve pushed so hard to stay alive. You�re my whole world, Baby, and don�t worry about what happens to you next. Family of people in the company who get killed are taken care of financially for the rest of their lives. Hey, maybe they�ll even give you a job (not in the department I was in, but definitely something well-paying and probably legal). I�m still so sorry I dragged you down this nightmarish rabbit-hole, but I�m so grateful you stuck beside me. In the beginning you had such a... morbid curiosity about my line of work. I never told you anything, so I thought I�d write down some of the more memorable stories of my past four years as a hitman, so here it is. Thank you for everything, Baby.Yours in life and death, Erios I never told you how I got into this life; trust me when I say it wasn�t by choice. After I received an unfair dishonorable discharge from the marines, I started working at a local restaurant in Boston as a waiter. During that unpleasant stint in my life, I started dating the barista who worked in the coffee shop a little down the street, Her name was Nazli. After dating for about six months, I moved into her small apartment in South Boston. For a while everything was going well! I got a raise and I was getting a second job as a cashier in a small electronic shop near the apartment. Everything was fine until one day I got off work early to surprise my girlfriend. It was raining so I borrowed my manager�s umbrella and walked home because I hate driving in the rain, and the store was only a few blocks away. Before I got inside I heard loud moaning from outside the door and my blood ran cold. I knew that sound was coming from her, I�ve heard it a million times.My sorrow quickly turned to rage, so I kicked down the door with one powerful kick. I saw them on the coffee table, the tall man on top of my Nazli. Before he had even turned around, I brought the umbrella down on his head with a wet thud. He went limp and fell to the floor, but my attention was on my little whore of a girlfriend. I jumped on top of her and looked into her terrified eyes as I brought the umbrella to her neck and started choking her with it. I watched the life slowly drain from her terrified eyes as she began to gasp for air as she tried to push me off of her, but I was much stronger than she was. The only thing that broke my focus from her eyes was the sound of the man grunting. I turned for a second to see him crawling towards a pile of clothes left on the ground. I moved one of my hands to the back of Nazli�s head and I smashed her head against the coffee table so she couldn�t get up. I stood up, umbrella soaked in blood, and walked over to the crawling man. I started to swing the umbrella down onto his head over and over until I had successfully bashed the man�s brains in. I dropped the blood soaked umbrella and noticed something glimmering out of the man�s discharged coat. I reached inside and pulled out a Chrome Beretta. I faced my dying girlfriend and watched her choking on her own blood. I raised the pistol and shot her through the head. Afterwards I couldn�t stop firing, shot after shot, bang after bang... I just kept shooting until I heard the gun click. I couldn�t recognize the face of my once beloved girlfriend, the woman only hours ago I kissed goodbye, the woman that found me at my lowest and supported me now paid unrecognizable. At that moment, I realized the commotion I had just raised; so I ran out of the apartment, dropped the gun, and ran down the fire escape and through the pouring rain. I ran faster when I heard the police sirens. I ran all the way to the electronic store, jumped in my car and made it out of there like a bat out of hell. I drove all the way down to Pittsburgh, got a motel under some bullshit alias, and cried. For the next two weeks, I lived in my car and spent all my money on booze and cheap girls in the area. I was drinking in a booth one night when a large Hispanic man dressed in a black, three-piece suit sat across from me. Then a tall, fit, bald Irish man with a black, button-up shirt and a shoulder-holstered gun stood next to him. He introduced himself as Eliot Desanta and told me I had caused a lot of headaches for his organization. When I asked him what he meant, he informed me that the man sleeping with my girl was an important hitman for a criminal organization called the White Glove Crime Syndicate. He explained to me that under most circumstances, he would have me shot, wrapped up in fishing wire, and left for fish food in Boston harbor. But after doing some research into my background, they found out I was in the Marine Sniper Corps and that I was one of the best recruits from Boston they ever had. Since I was such a talented and gifted marksman, and because they were short a hitman, he offered me a job. I asked what would happen if I declined. He told me, � then you would have your head bashed in with an umbrella.� After that, I took his offer. They brought me outside and drove me all the way back to Boston, and brought me into a small apartment. They told me if I left, they would find me. Eliot handed me the keys to the apartment and left. I checked the bedroom first. In my closet there was a number of fine coats, shirts, and pants hung up. On the floor were boots and a pair of black dress shoes. On the bed there was a fine pressed, dark blue suit and and a note that read: �0Your breifcases is under the bed. Check the desk in the other bed room for your new identification.�I showered and changed into one of the T-shirts and checked the rest of the apartment. There was an extra bedroom that was redesigned as an office. There was a desk in the middle of the room with a chair behind it, and a case file on the top of the desk. I checked the drawer and my heart began racing. Inside was a watch, a smart phone, and a handgun. A silenced USP I believe, a full magazine next to the gun, which I quickly loaded and chambered. I opened up the case file and it had a birth certificate for one �Sean Cobain.� It also had a driver�s license, a passport, a r�sum�, a debit card, and a number of gun permits. They had basically paid for me to have a completely new, very comfortable life, and all I had to do was kill for them. I couldn�t just walk away from that opportunity, could I? The last thing in the folder was a series of three number codes with the word �briefcases� on the top. I walked to the bedroom with the paper and took out the three briefcases and one large box. I opened the large box first, inside was a pair of combat pants and a black tactical Turtleneck. There was also a tactical belt, a shoulder, ankle, and side holsters, and there were boxes upon boxes of ammunition. There were even a few hand grenades which I giggled at. Everything was a little small on me, so I assumed this gear and maybe even this apartment belonged to the previous hitman. I checked the first briefcase, and inside the foam padded case was the parts for a sniper rifle� this caught my eye. Being a former Marine Sniper, I was quickly able to put the gun together and examine it. It was a military grade M24 sniper, that�s the gun I used during the short time I was in north Europe... like, an exact model, besides the large suppressor. I disassembled the gun and checked the other two cases. In one was a disassembled sub machine gun and in the other were two silenced pistols and a number of knives. I was in awe at all my new toys. I know one shouldn�t be excited about killing others, but it was enough fire power for an assault squad. It was surreal. A day ago I was sleeping in my car and drinking like I was dying, but now I was living like a king. I put all my gear away and went to the kitchen, fully stocked fridge. I made myself a sandwich and went to bed. For the first time since everything happened, I slept soundly. I woke up the next morning to a ringing coming from the closet. I walked over and reached inside the pocket of a tan trench coat and found a small flip phone. I answered. I heard a thick Irish accent, �We have a job for you, bring the sniper kit to the Red Foot hotel in South Boston at 2:30, don�t be followed, and dress for a party.� The number hung up. I smiled at myself, showered, and got ready for work.

I'm drinking a beer at this BBQ Fest when a young dad pushes his babystroller by me. He looks down and asks his son "Are you ready for another bump?" Thinking this is a hilarious joke by a super-hip dad, I yell "Hell yeah! That baby likes to party!" Immediately I realize he's referring to a bump in the sidewalk. Him and his child looked disgusted.

I have a pond in my yard, and it has some fish in it. My dog and I used to feed the fish together, and she would always carry the bucket of pellets in her mouth, it was like her favorite thing in the world.But one morning I went downstairs to see my neighbors dog running off with the fish food. It wasn't unusual to see some random dog just roaming around, since the neighborhood was full of dog owners.I was kind of upset about it since I felt bad for my fish, but I had work that day so I couldn't buy more until the next day.After that my dog became a total klepto (kleptomaniac) She would steal socks, shoes, underwear, headbands, boxes, literally anything that fit in her mouth. She wouldn't chew them or destroy them, just, gently picking them up and putting them on her bed.Well, fast forward three years, I hot a second dog and I decided to let them out to run like I usually did. My first dog (who I'm gunna refer to as D1, to make this easier) ran off.It wasn't uncommon for her to do this, so I didn't pay it much mind. But a few hours had past and I hadn't seen her, I was getting worried so I went outside to start calling for her. I could hear my neighbors dog barking and then out of the bushes comes D1.She's absolutely covered from head to tail in mud, and she's bookin it like I've never seen. Just an absolute bat outa hell.She barrels into the house and as I'm trying to process wtf just happened, she drops a little white treat ball on her bed.She hasn't been a klepto since that day.TL;DR So that's how my dog trained for three years to get revenge on the neighbors dog for ruining her favorite fishy time.

 Everytime I move schools I make an initiative to know at least what their birthdays were. Most of their birthdays I heard from other conversations and such.   My Language Teacher was the same deal. So I asked her if her birthday was blank-blank. She had the face of confusion because she had never said her birthday to any of us.

One time when I was 7, I was playing with my dads gun when he was getting food. My stupid 7 year old mind thought  that the gun wasn�t loaded and I shot the wall and it went though 1 more, so it went through 2 walls. So I got some glue and tissue paper and put it in the hole and my dad hasn�t found this out. This was 7 years ago I�m 14 nowbtw the gun was a .45 handgun*gun

(Bristol, UK 5:20am) I just got to my bus stop after work and sat there for a few minutes when a random ambulance car pulled over and started to talk to that guy a few benches away from me, I hadn't even noticed the guy, he was like properly dressed with a quite decent coat, so nothing that would have worried me.But as the guy wouldn't answer, an ambulance man and a police woman got out the car and shook his shoulder, the guy apparently was asleep so he woke up, could barely speak, seemed all fuzzy. The ambulance man asked him what he was up to, if we was alright, asked him if he had any cash to get a taxi and get home, told him that he should not be sleeping right here with this cold, so the guy who could still barely speak started empty his pockets, pulled out a phone with credit cards into the cover, so the ambulance man told him that he'll called a taxi for him, because he should better head home, which he did.Then a taxi pulled over literally 30 second later and the ambulance man started to explain the situation to the taxi, that he'll will have to drop the guy to a cash point on the way.And so hopefully now this guy is back home, warm and safe.After witnessing that I realized that it was actually around 1 degree and considering how the guy was sleeping, could barely speak and needed an arm to cross the road to the taxi, he might have died tonight, I mean, that would have been the worst case scenario but it could have occurred, but yet now it won't.It warmed my heart.So huge shootout to those nightworkers who probably weren't on their first case tonight, keep it up, the world need people like you.

This just happened around 1:30 AM in Texas, but we had an explosion at a power plant. Shook houses up to 10+ miles away. They are currently preparing for more explosions and there is no death count as of now. Pray for those who have to respond to the explosion. Please keep in mind that this is from one of the smallest power plants in the area. It�s luck that it wasn�t one of the big ones, because a bigger plant would of leveled the houses nearby it. This smaller one broke windows and doors of the houses which were 0-1.5 miles away. I will update with more in the morning, if it�s not on national news by then. [THIS ](https://www.facebook.com/100004323644471/posts/1486825781471529?d=n&sfns=mo) is a link to a video taken by a security camera. It is currently 3:01 am and it started to rain. Another lucky Coincidence since it was supposed to rain all day, but didn�t. This will definitely help with the fire.UPDATE: There has been a secondary explosion and everyone is being evacuated from the Power Plant. All EMS have been evacuated. 2:03 pm.2nd UPDATE: A tower has fallen and that was the cause of the second explosion. There has been a mandatory evacuation for the area im in, may not be updating in a while due to evacuation.3rd UPDATE: There has been a third explosion, emergency personnel have been evacuated and the flames have reached the oil tanks. A forth, larger explosion is expected. This time, people may die.4th UPDATE: The chemicals being leaked are being controlled and shut off, they are planning of letting the fire burn itself out after all the chemicals have been shut off. This is very significant progress and if things continue to improve, the fire will be gone in a few days.

\-Based on a True Story-During my 9th grade, I used to walk at this narrow ally since it was pretty much a shortcut to my house. Whenever I pass through there, I usually see this tattered, dirty, old man (probably on his late 60's) just sitting next by the dumpster. Usually, some people in such a state would tend to beg or plead for alms as random people ignore and pass them like they were nobodies. But this person I seemed to pass through just doesn't even care.He's aware that I pass through, however. He'd usually look up just by a glimpse of me catching him at the corner of my eye as I'd walk briskly. During the first few times I'd pass by i'd hesitate. But eventually, it was like a normal daily thing for both him and me. This one time however, changed things a bit. As I got out from school, and did a sharp left turn to enter the ally I usually go for, and as expected, the old man was there by the dumpster, just sitting there staring at the floor. Since I felt a bit generous during that day, I decided to hand him over 5$ by placing it on the floor to the direction of where he was just staring, and started walking away like usual. But then, he shouted: "Hey, kid!"I turned back to see who it was. To my surprise it was the old man. Staring at me. Smiling. Holding the 5$ bill I gave him with his right hand. Then suddenly, out of the blue, shoved the 5$ bill in his mouth, and started chewing it. Slowly. Being both dumbfounded, astonished, and creeped out as to why he did that, I decided (for some reason) to exclaim in response: "Why would you do that?!"He simply laughed as he swallowed and gulped the last pieces of paper on his mouth, and gestured me to approach him. I was hesitant at first to even bother, but he raised both of his arms and he simply said that he had no intention of harming me. So I decided to move towards him in a cautious manner as he simply sat down to his same spot, this time looking at me instead of the floor he likes so much.I repeated the same question as to why he even had the intention of eating the money I gave him, and his response was rather off: "You gave me the dough, I pay you back with wisdom."Wisdom?Of course I was confused as to how, what, why he would even bother with something like that, instead of using the money with something more beneficial for himself. I couldn't even utter a proper word when he said that, so I made some confused expression and I suppose he got the gist of it."Truth is subjective, it's never absolute." The old man said, ignoring my confusion as he was scratching the floor with his long fingernails. "An eye for an eye makes the world blind, but the reason why it was taken could never be justified." He paused for awhile. Looking down. "Truth is like trying to draw a line, but it can't straighten up for itself or to the writer... because it would always make a dent, no matter how pretty or hidden it is." And finally he said, "Watch those dents, kid. you'll never know which curve is more pointed than nothing at all."After this he simply gestured for me to piss off, so I did. With utter confusion. Later that day, I was just scratching my head as I was on my bed, staring at the ceiling of my room. Wondering that was all that about. So to satisfy my curiosity,  I decided to give him the same about tomorrow to see if anything would be new.So I did. Same thing as before, hard turn to the ally, old man was there, gave him the 5$ and this time waited.Waited... Waited...And it was a straight seven minutes of me just staring at him while he was just staring at the floor. A waste of time, I thought. Why did I even bother. By the time I was about to turn to the direction of where I usually go pass to, The old man suddenly grabbed me by my right shoulder, having a strong grip. And with his other hand was a knife directly between my eyes.From there, I really thought I was about to die. I was shaking, thinking about any possibility this man can do to me. And I just made some shaky sigh and waited for death. I then felt the tip of the knife was already in contact with my skin. And from there, I thought it was over... so I decided to close my eyes....I hear laughter three seconds after. And a grip no longer a vise on my shoulder. The old man was laughing so hard that he even made quite a scene by the dumpster he was hitting his hand hard with from laughing. I could only stare and have the feeling of relief at that point.The old man then threw the knife at picked up the money I gave him, this time tearing it piece by piece... eating it piece by piece. "Gullible." He said. "What you've learned here today is the importance of hesitation, kid." He then sat down smiling with some pieces of money was at his mouth. "Trusting a hobo is pretty low, even for me." He pauses. "So if something so low could already damage so much, what more is to something that's beyond and high? Know your limits, kid." He waves me off to leave. "Know this and even your limits can break." As I walked away from the situation I just went through, I only hear laughter through the distance as I walked away.Now this time I was thinking of: Why the hell am I even bothering with this hobo? Why the hell was I doing this? I don't even need to bother with this. Screw that path, I'm taking the usual route. The next day, I decided to NOT go to the shortcut where that man was. And I decided to take my normal route before I discovered the ally. I decided to patch myself up with a pair of earphones and listen to music on the way home to take my mind off things. But before I could even plug the earpieces at my ears, I heard the laughing. And immediately looked back only to see the old man just three inches away from me. He had both his hands up, having a huge grin stapled on his face. "You're missing a lesson or two from me today, kid." Before I could even say anything to make him piss off, he just said something that made me stop. "This'll be my last few, and I'm gone. Trust me, kid." Whatever I could do, It's definitely not letting this hobo know where I lived, so I decided to backtrack back to my route to the ally as to where I usually take my turn to make my shortcut.It would be super awkward that this weirdo was just behind me, as people I knew from school by face would be staring blankly at me and the idiot behind me, but eventually I just ignored them. Finally, the old man finally said something. "Look around, and count the pairs of eyes glued to something off. To something odd." Before I could respond he only continued to something that made me realize things. "...to something different like me." And he was quiet after throughout the whole 'unique' commute I made up until the ally where we usually cross paths. He wasn't wrong. He wasn't technically right too. But I understood what he meant by what he said back there.Finally, we managed to make it to the usual hot-spot of the great dumpster he dwells in. Out of instinct, I pulled out my wallet to give him the same amount as before. But before I could, he chuckled as simply said "Not this time".After the few minutes of me trying to insist in giving him some money, he'd only say no; he'd eat the whole thing anyway and it'd be a waste. Realizing this, I just decided to say my goodbyes and walked away. "Come by here tomorrow for one last lesson!" He said, and laughed after. I kinda got used to him. So in a matter of it being weird, I couldn't help myself but smile a bit and low-key looked forward for tomorrow.I did my usual duties at school, got dismissed, made my usual turn to the ally and to see the ol-&#x200B;He's not there?&#x200B;When I made it to the usual spot of where he always sits by, waiting and staring at the random direction of a piece of floor he'd usually get mesmerized on... he wasn't there. Instead, what was occupying his usual sitting place was a neatly wrapped piece of slightly crumpled newspaper. I realized there was something written on it by some marker: "Kid." it was written on.When I unfolded the wrappings... to my surprise, it was 15$. Not wet, not torn in pieces.Inside the wrappings, there was a bold text written there. It was intentional. It was emphasized, like the words written were screaming for attention:**"Last lesson: Give and Take. Good luck out there, kid."** Three years passed ever since that happened, I never get to see that smiling old man. I'd finish my duties in school, take my turn to the ally, and walk past the spot where the old man was. That old man that was creepy. That man that almost killed me. The man that followed me. The man that'd be willing to chew and swallow money... All for the sake of lessons given to some random stranger. Hoping that it was worth the trouble. Hoping he'd passed them down.Passed down the act of wisdom.&#x200B;(Thanks for reading all the way! :3)

I was having painful erections when I was 12 and had no idea why. So painful, like, on the floor crying pain. So painful it wakes you up, pain. I went to a doctor and it was some useless bitch who didnt even try to look at it. Next doctor looked thoroughly and found a hair, and he cut it. And the pain was instantly gone .

      Im about to graduate so I guess its time to tell this story. At my high school, the boys swim team has a very stupid tradition that my friends and I started. It involves a bunch of idiots and a dangerously old jar of salsa.       Back in freshman year, we were waiting for the bus to our districts meet when a senior pulls out a jar of salsa and some Tostitos. He invited a circle of swimmers to share it with and we had a great time talking and eating until the bus arrived.      When we got there, we of course do our warmups and start the meet, but swimmers are particularly crazy about cheering on their team. We stand by the far edge of the pool and yell loud enough to be heard underwater. We did this until the senior (that brought us the salsa) stepped up to start swimming the 100 butterfly race. He�s a good friend so we start cheering like crazy, then one of us holds up the salsa as if its an idol.  At that moment, we could tell he saw it and we must have cheered at least 3x louder.       He ended up winning first place in the event and we went crazy. At the end of the meet, our school placed 5th, but we had a ton of fun in the locker room after with a shower party (don�t ask) and other bits of playful idiocy.       At that shower party, another boy held up the jar of salsa and we start cheering again. My close friends and the senior decided to make this a ritual, so we sealed the salsa in our locker room ceiling and removed it every year for districts to do borderline pagan chants around, and get hyped for the meet. Nobody dares to open it (thank god) because it is now 4 years old and would likely kill anyone who dares to eat it.      To this day,  it stays above the ceiling in our locker room rotting away until the next districts meet, but it is immortalized by the joy we have made around it. Under the jar, there are papers with the names of all members of the �salsa society� and it has been passed down between classes.      I say this story because its the stupid memories like this that are meaningful in high school. Friends will come and go, and everything will pass, but memories will stay as long as you live. So to any freshman or people down about school, remember the things like this, because they will be some of the best things you come out of high school with. Thanks for reading my story.

So today after my swimming training, I walked towards my mom car and she got out of the car and told me and my brother that the car�s battery died. She tried to call my dad 7 times and then we went in the swimming center so we wouldn�t freeze to death and we tried to text my dad and call him using another phone. He didn�t answer. I told my mom that me and my brother could push the car to a parking spot because the car was not in a parking spot and simply in front of the swimming center and she could get a ticket for that. She agreed and we waited so no car was in front of her car to start pushing. My mom was turn the wheels and my brother and I were pushing the car. It was really easy until we needed to push the car a little bit uphill. My brother and I were struggling to push it when suddenly a man and his son asked us : Avez-vous besoin d�aide ? (Do you need help ?). We answered yes and he started pushing the car with us. With his help we were able to push the car to a parking stop. After that, my mom tried to start the car again but it didn�t work. Then the man kindly offered us to drop us off somewhere. We happily accepted and thanked him. He dropped us off to a restaurant where my dad and my mom were supposed to meet for dinner (they agreed to that before he stopped answering his calls). So if you are reading this, thanks guys ! You guys are super kind and my family is very grateful for your help !After that, we had dinner with my dad and turns out, his IPhone was updating. Thanks Apple, thanks.Anyway, after dinner, we went back to the swimming center to try to make the car work again. It didn�t work. My dad then said that we should go buy some cables to connect my dad�s car�s battery to my mom�s car�s battery to try to restart it. Then a nice lady came to us and asked us if we needed some cables. My mom accepted and the nice lady gave us the cables and we were able to restart the car. If you are reading this, Thanks nice lady !After that we were able to safely go home. And my dad is going to buy a new battery for my mom�s car. The moral of this story is that the myth that Canadian are super kind is true. (I was born there and there are a lot of moments like that but that was one of the best ones)

(This happened almost a year ago)So it was my dads birthday, and he really likes those Hersheys Gold bars, and I decided to get him one. I live really close to a hardware store, so I walked there and was about to get one from the checkout isle, but I first stopped by the flex seal isle for a second because why not. A few seconds after I got there, this one employee came by and asked if I was finding everything ok. I wasn�t planning on buying anything except the chocolate bar anyway, so I was just like yeah. The dude didnt leave, though, he just stood there at the entrance to the flex seal isle staring at me. I decided to make my way towards the checkout isle so I could buy the candy and leave. I walked into the next isle, which was a bunch of cleaners and stuff (Clorox Wipes, Windex, etc) but this employee followed me. That�s when it became clear to me that he thought I was trying to steal something. Then he asked �Is there a specific type of cleaner you�re looking for?� rather sarcastically. I was kind of intimidated by this dude and didn�t really want to talk to him so I was just like �Yeah, I found it,� grabbed the cheapest item off the shelf (a can of Lysol wipes). I bought the Lysol wipes along with some Reese�s peanut butter cups (they were out of Hershey�s gold bars) and walked back home. The next day I gave the Lysol wipes to my 7th grade social studies teacher.TLDR: Went to hardware store to get candy for my dad, employee thought I was trying to steal something, I bought Lysol wipes and left.

I�m at a gas station buying a beer right before they stop selling alcohol for the night. So I'm paying for my beer when a little girl and her dad come up to the counter and tell the attendant that there's some guy in the women's bathroom all tied off about to shoot up. The attendant goes back there yelling "Ay! I told you you can't do that shit here you fuck."  Guy staggers out of the bathroom in wet pants with toilet paper all over himself and pushes folks out of his way to get to the door which he slams open.  Still tied off mind you. This gas station is located right near the state police dept, so of course there�s usually a cop filling up, who sees this guy slam out of the store and slump into his car, followed by the occupants of the store, cause this is turning into a great show. The officer approaches the car, taps the window. We all hear the car click/beep as the idiot locks the car.  The cop radios it in, and about 30seconds later, the lot is full of cops. With an ambulance on the way. He shoots up in his car anyways yelling about wanting to be left alone and nods off. The police bust into his car and send him off handcuffed to a stretcher in an ambulance. Distracted and entertained by the encounter, I forget my beer at the register, which I don�t realize until I get home and think to myself how much I really want to drink that beer. Fortunately the attendant was a good sport about it and let me come pick it up later, even though the beer cave was already locked up.

 I woke up with the worst hangover I have ever had. I feel like a truck ran over me. I try to open my eyes, only to be welcomed with darkness. I don�t even know where I am. I try my best to stand up but my headache only got stronger. I guess I�m just going to lie down for a bit. With a lot of difficulties, I remember what happened last night. I was at a wedding of a friend, My wife and daughter got home early for their respective work and school day. I got a day off, So I kept drinking and had fun with my pals. I don�t remember anything else. *Maybe I�m still at the party?*Few minutes pass before I try to stand up again, with much success this time. My body is really stiff, almost as if I didn�t move for years. I try to call my friends, but my throat feels so dry, to the point that I�m not able to make a sound except a faint groan. *Man, this time I did get heavy handed on the alcohol*. I still can�t see anything, except the dim light of the candles around the place? Strange, maybe someone put them here for me. As I walked my first step, I found out that I don�t have shoes on. As soon as I took a step forward, I am met with a strange liquid on the floor. It must be the wine I was drinking and probably toppled it on the floor when I was drunk. S*illy me�*The more I walk around, the more I realized where I am. When I finally bumped into the stairs, it hit me�it�s my house, my basement! I must have slept on the floor when I managed to get back home. The basement is directly linked to the garage. I reach the car to see if my shoes were in it, but something is off�It�s not my car, even in the dark I can tell that the car is something of a white color, my car is blue! A feeling of guilt runs over me, *did I steal a car?!* *Oh god, I hope not*. I hope the car belongs to someone who just drove me here.While I was walking around, my leg hit something on the floor. My vision is still hazy, but it looks like a leg of a mannequin� *No way..! why is there a thing like that in my garage?!* I need to ask my wife, maybe she has an idea of what�s going on. I turn back to the stairs and reach the first floor. I struggle greatly to move my feet stair after stair. But it doesn't hurt at least. It took some time, but I finally got to the door, which was open..? *I hope my wife doesn�t see me like this, or she will be really mad again*. To be honest� This was not the first time I got home drunk, but I don�t remember being this drunk. Regardless, at least everyone had fun tonight.From what I can see out of the windows, it�s nighttime, raining and storming judging by the sounds I�m hearing. At least everyone is still asleep. I took the time to look around. Feeling thirsty, I went to the kitchen to drink some water. I try to turn the lights on, but nothing� did the thunder provoke a blackout? *Really lucky tonight Ryan*� Holding a glass in my hand. *Damn, even my fingers are struggling to move*, I thought to myself. I still managed to get to the sink and served myself a nice glass of water.Drinking from the glass, I can feel the water in my mouth, suddenly I sense a cold feeling on my feet. *Really? Did I really just spill some water..?* *I�m gonna wipe this mess later, still not feeling good enough to do anything*. I still see some candles around. *That�s nice, I can�t see clearly but the candles are a great help to know where I am.* On the table near some candles, there is a newspaper, probably the one from yesterday. It�s from the local news. Main title: �A man kill himself while driving drunk.� *Poor man, at least I got lucky*. Suddenly I realise I must stink from sleeping drunk in the spilled wine. *I should take a shower, it would be good if I can reach the bathroom on the second floor*.When I get back to where the stairs were, I see a good amount of dust and dirt were I was standing. *Did I fall on the dirt at the wedding? It�s over... I can already see it, my wife�s gonna kill me�* *at least I know my fate*. As I climb up the stairs, the thunder is getting louder and louder. *it is getting closer? Not really a problem, the electricity was down already*. Finally reaching the top, I pass by the chambers to get to the bathroom. As expected no light� *Fair enough, didn�t expect anything*.I�m about to enter the shower, when I heard a creacking sound. I look behind me and see the door of my daughter�s room opening. *Shit, did I wake her up?* Before I could do anything, the door close shut. *Oh no..! she must think I�m a thief, dammit!* I reach her door and try to open it, *locked�* I knock the door and try to speak, but my throat is still dry, only groans again. The more I try to speak, the more I got angry. *Come on, SPEAK!*�Please... Calm down...� it�s the voice of my daughter. I stop and wait. *Did she know it�s me?* I waited for a long while until hearing the clicking sound of her door. Standing still in front of it, until a faint �come...� invites me to open it. Still stiff, I struggle to open the door. I see my daughter on her bed, she seem to hug an object that looks like a book..? �Dad..?� wakes me up from my thoughts. �It is you..?� I can only nod slowly. As I walk half way through her room, she runs and reaches me �I missed you so much!�. She hugs me like no tomorrow. �Dad!� She was crying. *What happened? I was only gone for a few hours.*As the time passes, a few thoughts were bugging me while I was hugging my daughter back. Her hair was longer and she was a little bit taller than what I remember. *Must be my hangover tricking me*. �it�s been over a year that you�re gone, but it�s okay now, we are a family again!� *A year!? She must have gotten a really bad dream*. *As a father I can�t let my daughter be hurt like this!* �Mom changed, she was sad, day by day, she go closer to despair and depression. At the end, she was just an empty shell, I�m sure she is happy where she is now...� *Wait a minute, she is still dreaming right..? It�s not possible that my wife left me... My head hurt so much*�The more my daughter speaks, the sleepier i get. *What it going on..?* �I found... book, there was a way for... come back. I took my decision...I fetch your� in the cem..., I did what was written in the... to summon... we gonna stay... together... daddy!� *Not good, I can�t hear Clara clearly anymore*. I was still hugging her. *I hope� she doesn�t mind� letting me sleep� here� for a while�*Seconds, minutes, hours pass until I woke up. The sun shines through the room, waking me up. As I stand up, I only see the candle and the faint light coming from the closed window. I reach it and open it. The first thing I see is my right arm all bloody, like I cut myself. It didn�t help that as I look around. The floor of my daughter�s room was covered in blood. *WHERE IS SHE?!* I come back to where I was sleeping, the last place I saw my daughter. Hoping that everything is alright, but there is no such hope�Only a gore pile of flesh and bone were lying on the floor. *Wh� What�s happening?* I go back to the bathroom, I want to see myself. But in the reflection of the mirror, I only see a grotesque version of myself, missing flesh, covered in dirt and blood, bluish and greenish color, straight from a horror movie� I*t is� It is a prank?! Come on think, think, THINK!* As I recall my memories, my headaches got stronger... Then suddenly, in utter horror... I remember� I finally remember... In the basement, I awakened initially... I ate the body of a woman, my wife... I did the same with my daughter in her room�*It is a nightmare!?* *Please! I just want to fucking wake up!* I go downstairs, nearly falling, reaching the front door. Opening it and running away from this hell. *I just want to wake up!* *PLEASE!* I reach the road, searching for a place to run away from this madness. Suddenly I see a truck speeding in my direction, honking at me. And then, pure darkness... again... I feel relieved, I�m gonna wake up soon from this hellish nightmare... I hear the voice of my wife and daughter, they�re waiting for me. *I�m coming home*...

I was homeless for 5 months about a year ago. I have two STEM degrees and at the time, zero 'science' experience, zero connections, and a bad attitude from 3 years of constant rejection; from what I can only imagine as my aspy side showing in interviews.Due to owning a car, up here in Canada I was seen as "not poor enough" to qualify for welfare- I would have to sell the car first; a 12yr old Camry. My last employer (I was working trades to scrape by, 32k a year doesn't get you far in Canada) fired and blackballed me for calling him out on making us do unsafe work - but he called it something else on the paperwork to get what he wanted (clearly I didn't have the resources or time to fight that) [means no EI and is an asshole move to not lay off]. My family was able to wire me about 100$ a month, but apartments in Canada are 1200-1600 for an unfinished basement these days. On the up side, I wasn't exactly paycheque to paycheque and had a reserve of about 3 months saved up; I've been close to homeless before twice in my life thus had a plan thought out. I used the 100$ a month to buy the cheapest storage locker I could find, and moved my half a van worth of stuff into it. Then I packed my camping gear, grabbed a bunch of backroads map books, gas cans & a garden hose, and soup mixes... (thank god my mother had the foresight to put me in scouts for like 20 years). And used my Y membership to shower as I camped my way across the country knocking on every single door in my prospective industries. That first night in a crisp May? A nice camping vacation in the backcountry. Two weeks later with only rice and soup and hunting for a secluded place in the dark was when the reality started to sink in. Filtering your own water gets real old fast Half my day was subsistence. Got shot at by farmers a couple times trying to source gas, but I'm still here. Door knocking was torture. Most employers gave me the "apply online here" line. The first few I mouthed off at.  I wouldn't be doing this if I still believe online worked - no more online applications, EVER. (Applying online is like junk mail, no one looks at that stuff, and it wastes your time filling in all their BS and filling out the questionnaires that can take up to several hours.) I started getting snooty to the ones who were clearly humouring me to entertain their day, but the practice made me more and more wise... I was beginning to be able to con my way past the desk staff. Remember my mention I was using the Y effectively? Well I also have a suit for interviews only to wear, little dated but it works -- and went in acting bored and tired (well I was, the nervousness goes away after about the 10th time) and said to the secretary I had a meeting with "the operations manager, hold on I have his name here somewhere *scroll through phone* Oh you mean /BOB/? Yes, exactly..." And before you know It I'm talking to the person who's actually running the show. They usually gave me about 10-15 minutes to explain myself [not mentioning the sleeping in car part] and I'd ask them "well It's clear you aren't looking to hire right now, but what would you like to see on my CV that would make you interested in the future?" and that got them-- made them actually read the thing... Within a week of running the con I had 2 offers. Granted it took 2 more months for those offers to come. I got 5 more in the meantime, 6 of the total offers given were fake to get rid of me... Despite all of that, I only needed one yes. Now I work in my educated industry on the other side of the country for a reasonable wage. All it took was risking literally everything, sacrificing my friends, family, and lifestyle. Land of opportunity my ass.  I'm Just thankful it worked before the snow came. I was one of the lucky ones to have foresight and planning on my side. I couldn't imagine being in that situation and wrestling with any major mental health issues... because if you didn't have them surface before, doing that sure as shit will put them front and center. Now the new challenge of making new friends in a foreign town, alien culture (odd despite being the same flag outside), and very limited free time has begun.The lesson learned from all of this: Networking surpasses every other thing you will ever do in your life. It's who you know, not what, that gets you ahead. Classism in Canada is very real, very scary, and can make or break your life regardless of education or experience. Go out there and make friends. Also, if not already, develop camping skills for when the shit does actually hit the fan. Those preppers may seem crazy, but that stockpile might come in handy during worklessness. Oh, and the guy who fired me for citing safety? I lawyered up, the judge loved the 'it's not about the money' testimony I gave-- Apparently, I wasn't the first and his company is now banned from operating. If you're reading this with a similar story, the statute of limitations may still be valid on your case, go get 'em.

swim time is all fun and games until you wind up linking arms with the entirety of camp to wade through the lake trying to find the body of the missing camper who presumably drowned.  summer of �91 and Stacie is living it up with Jesus in her Christian camp�mosquitoes, crappy food and all.  swim time was a highly anticipated part of the day, even for her age group who had a significantly shorter swim time than the big kids.  after placing her key ring on the pegboard, a necessary procedure before entering your age�s roped off part of the lake to ensure no one gets lost or left behind, Stacie hopped in and splashed around in the leech infested waters.  She didn�t question the fact that it did indeed seem quite a bit longer than normal.however, the fun ended quickly when the panicked head of camp called an emergency all-camp prayer meeting.  all of camp, young and old, gathered on a hill to be informed of a missing camper who had been left in the lake and most assuredly drowned.  tears welled up in Stacie�s eyes as they all held hands and bowed their heads in prayer.  what would the child�s poor parents do?  how could this happen at her good christian camp?the counselors called for the campers to help search for the child�s body to reduce time spend on looking.  they all linked arms and began to walk out through the water hoping to find the body but not be the one to step on it.  after an hour of searching, they lost hope.  a camper was dead on their watch, and there was nothing they could do about it.  however, as Stacie exited the lake, a glimmer of light struck her attention.  a single key ring was still on the pegboard, presumably the dead child�s.  upon closer inspection, her heart dropped to her stomach.  it was her number on that key ring.  Stacie pulled a counselor aside and proceeded to explain that she believed she was the dead child.  She must not have gone into the side of the lake in which her key ring was placed and ended up swimming with the older kids for their significantly longer swim time.  needless to say, the staff was far from pleased, but Stacie did not find her own dead body that day and they kept a close eye on her for the rest of the week.

One day I was sitting in a boring science class and then the quiet loudly exclaimed �I AM TIRED OF THIS� (guns here are illegal) then he reaches into his backpack. Turns out he was just putting his stuff into it to clear his desk and slept for the remaining 2 classes. Everyone felt equally confused and shocked and that shit is what bonds the class

I walk to school, in the same way, every day. When you live in New York City, you find patterns and the most efficient route to get to your destination. Walk down Broadway, make a left on 25th and walk through Madison Square Park. If you're not a New Yorker, Madison Square Park is a decent size park with a usually a decent amount of people eating lunch, kids playing in the playground and a nice path to cut my route in half. But this day was different. I was walking through with headphones in, head down and trying to avoid as many people as possible. I was approached by a woman with a clipboard and I brushed her off because it seemed like she wanted to sell me something and I was having none of it. Shortly thereafter, I was again confronted by an older man that was being more assertive saying something like "the park is closed off, please use the 26th street entrance". Please, this is New York, they don't just close off public parks at noon. As I marched past this man I noticed that I was the only person that was using this path. I pulled out my headphones and looked around. I heard the older gentlemen say "Cut, cut!" into a walkie talkie. I soon realize that I fucked up and ruined some kind of movie set. Feeling like a total douche bag I increased my stride and high tailed out of there. As I am leaving, I see a motorcycle stopping and turning around to get back into position. "Must be a part of the movie?" I said. Feeling like an asshole, I make my way to school and forget about this fiasco. Months go by and I am watching the newly released season of "Blacklist" on Netflix. The setting looks awfully familiar. The camera is panning to the clock tower that overlooks Madison Square Park, they film the Flat Iron building and I put the clues together and I realize it's the park. The scene unfolds and it's the same scene that ruined months prior. The motorcycle in the scene to confirm my suspicion. Well, I'm an asshole.

You ever have something happen to you that made you question your life decisions?Well, the year was 1987. I was a seven year old boy out grocery shopping with my dad.  We were pretty poor in those days and never spent more than we should.  I was such an innocent and trusting young boy.  As were walking to our car I notice our car door open and my dad telling me to stay put.  He ran to the car and slammed the door shut.  I heard the worst sounds I�ve ever heard, two legs breaking and a young man screaming for his life.  Dad throws the groceries in the trunk, throws me in the car.  We drove away with a broken car door and some guy was laying on the ground begging for help incoherently with two broken legs.Welcome to the world boy.Hey, if you�re reading this I hope you turned your life around.

So every year eighth grade students go to Washington DC every year around the country. I went on the trip and it�s was the worst trip of my life. I live in Florida so to get to DC it�s a 18 hour bus ride. we get to DC and everything�s going great I�ll the third day where I lost my wallet with $100 in it from working at my job. (I�m pretty sure the maid took it but I don�t know) after that we went to the mall to eat and shop I couldn�t eat lunch because I had the money. Later that night we went to Golden corral to eat dinner before 18 hour bus ride back (Golden corral is a Buffay) my friend bought me food because he New that I didn�t eat lunch. I eat the pizza at Golden Corral and it was nasty and uncooked so I ate different things like chicken and stuff. On the way back to Florida I couldn�t sleep because The kid next to me was snoring and everybody was coughing and sneezing on the bus,so I couldn�t sleep and I was sick two hours later I ran to the back of the bus and threw up at least 20 times. The bus ran over a bump and throw up went all over my shirt. That was the worst trip of my life

I think we were around 11-12 years old when it happened. It was 8 p.m. and we were on our way to go Trick or Treating when we passed through a park. We saw 3 guys (2 of them looked like 18 year olds and the other one looked like a 14 year old) who were just sitting and chatting. We didn't think much of it.After about an hour, we decided to go to another neighbourhood. As we were walking, we noticed that the same guys from the park were behind us (they were around 5-6 metres from us back then). They were in the same way as us. We got a bit worried, but thought they were just in our way.  We reached a playground when we turned around and saw THE SAME GUYS FOLLOWING US (this time, they were around 15-20 metres away). We realised it's not a coincidence and they were actually stalking us. We acted like we still think that they are going in seperate ways.We got into a block of flats, which was pretty much isolated from any other flats or shops, when we turned to see whether they were still following us or not. We could see them right when they were coming around the corner (again, they were around 20 metres away from us). They saw us entering, but we shut the door as fast as possible. We went to an upper floor and saw that one of them was already going back, while the others (the older ones) were arguing. The one pointed at our door while the other was shouting at him. Then, they both walked back.I know, that they were like 18 and 14 and could only harass us or something, but I don't think that stalking somebody for a long period of time (1 h. and 30 minutes to be exact), or even stalking somebody in general is normal.

My name is Rick, I'm originally from Peru so please forgive my grammar but i want to share this event  that pretty much change my entire life and by the way  I'm not trying to preach anything because this is 100% real and this is my story, when is i was 27 i was going through the darkest time of my life, my wife left me, i started drinking more that usual, i started  using drugs and i was flat broke and because of that i end up moving to my brother's house , i was so lonely and depressed i seriously thought my life was ruin so my night i was thinking about when i was a kid and how much i used to believe in God, but now i think God just forgot about me so that night i started praying and i said : "Lord please i need to know that you exist, i want you to talk to me because i want to believe in you again but i don't want to see anything like an angel or something like that because i don't want to freak out", so pretty much that's  what i said but i really meant it with all my heart so about a week passed by and went to a near by smoke shop to by some fake week that a friend put me on recently i guess it was the same as the K-2 stuff that everybody was smoking around that time , so i went home and i was about to do study for a test but i said" mmm.. maybe i'll smoke a little bit and then i'll study " so i did and it didn't go well, i could focus at all  so i decided, maybe i'll just do some laundry i'm too high to study so i went to my closet and i started smelling all the dirty cloth that was on the floor because i didn't know what was clean or dirty anymore , it was a mess, so i pick up a dirty shirt, i smelled it and then ... i started having this strange feeling like i was getting into a trans, my mind tarted pulsating, i stared at my door for a few minutes and then i said out laud " fuck dude you are drug addict, you are a drug addict, you are a drug addict, you are a drug addict" and then it hit me, i felt like some body else was saying that , i felt like my soul and body were telling me that as if they were mad at me and then everything changed ... this force took over my mind and body , something that made me feel like a was an insect about to get crush any second now and i said " OK OK OK OK OK OK !  I BELIEVE  I BELIEVE  I BELIEVE ! and i stared saying this because i had this overwhelming feeling bigger that anything in the universe  something that made me feel so small and scared but also i had the feeling that you get when your father is really mad at you and disappointed and he is yelling at you and in that moment i realized ... this is GOD ! ... GOD is talking to me, not with words, just direct messages  BELIEVE !   BELIEVE !   BELIEVE !   BELIEVE !...  so i drop on my keens and i said  i BELIEVE   i BELIEVE   i BELIEVE  for like 10 minutes until i meant it ... i got what i asked for  .. God talked to me and also letting me know that we wasn't happy with the way i was living my life  because the moment i stopped saying i believe He told, where is the rest? meaning the rest of the K-2 , so i grabbed whatever i had left , went outside and trowed it all over the lawn and went for a walk on my street trying to calm down and think about what just happened but on my way back i felt this enormous relive,this huge weight out of my back because i knew in that moment that i was done with that for good .(there is a second part to this story ,that is way more intense so please stick around for the conclusion )

There was a very beautiful young woman who had always dreamed of being a model. After finishing college, she found work in the fashion industry, modeling clothes for style magazines. As her career progressed, she went on many photo shoots in a variety of exotic countries.On one of these photo shoots, she was paired with a very handsome male model. They were both very attracted to each other and, one night, they kissed. Soon, the beautiful and handsome pair began dating and they gradually fell in love.After a few years, they decided to get married. At the wedding, everyone complimented them, telling them that they made a gorgeous couple. Some of the guests said that they were so good-looking that their children would certainly be beautiful. Before long, the wife was pregnant and the happy couple looked forward to starting a family and spending a wonderful life together.However, when the baby was born, the couple were horrified. It was the ugliest baby anyone had ever seen. The doctors and nurses were speechless. They couldn�t even bear to look at the baby. The mother and father had to stop themeselves from vomiting whenever they caught sight of the disturbing face of their infant son.As the years passed, the baby boy grew older and his face grew more and more ugly. His eyes bugged out, his nose was deformed and the skin around his mouth was rotting. By the time he was 3 years old, he was hideous and his parents kept the little boy hidden in his bedroom. They never allowed him out of the house and refused to let their relatives, friends and neighbors ever set eyes on him. The good-looking couple were ashamed that they had given birth to a child with such a repulsive and monstrous face.The strain of having such an ugly child took its toll on their marriage. The couple spent most of their time fighting and arguing. Trapped in the house every day with her hideous son, the wife began to lose her mind. Whenever she looked out the window, she would see other children playing gleefully together and was filled with resentment. Her deranged mind began to develop murderous intentions.One day, the father decided that spending so much time hidden indoors was not healthy for his wife and son. He suggested that they should go for a picnic at a nearby lake. That day, they drove out to the lake and selected a nice spot, by the edge of a cliff, for their picnic.Their ugly son said he needed to go to the toilet. The mother told him to pee over the side of the cliff. When the boy was close to the edge, he pulled down his zipper. Suddenly, his mother reached out and pushed him off the cliff.The father was horrified, but then a strange look passed between the married couple. He seemed to understand what she had done. Without a word, the parents packed up their picnic basket and blanket and drove home. They had finally rid themselves of the ugly boy. When their neighbors asked them about their son, they simply said that he had died after a long illness.A year later, the wife became pregnant again. Initially, the couple were worried that they would be cursed with another ugly son. However, their fears proved unfounded, because when the baby was born they were delighted to discover that it was a beautiful baby girl. The child looked just like her parents. Unlike their first child, the parents loved and nurtured their little girl. They were so proud of her that they showed her off to their friends and neighbors. The family spent many happy years together.Time passed and the little girl was almost four years old, she told her parents that she wanted to go on a boat ride for her birthday. On the day that she turned four, the parents drove out to the nearby lake with their beloved daughter. The day was very sunny and they rented a boat and sailed out across the placid waters.They were in the middle of the lake when the girl said, �Mommy, I need to pee.�The mother helped the little girl to take off her panties. After checking that nobody was looking, she lifted her daughter up and held her over the edge of the boat so that she could go to the toilet.The little girl looked back at her father and said, �Don�t let Mommy drop me this time.�

One of my many first memories was of my mom and aunt taking me around with them to break into storage units.In the mid 90's when I was roughly 7 years old my mom, my younger 3 sisters, younger brother and myself lived in a section 8 ghetto. We were the only white family and my mom was the resident "Candy Lady". For those who don't know what a lady lady is, She would sell candy, soda pop, smokes, beer and microwave food and hair products that stank for the residents of our community in exchange for coin of course. Everyday after school I would come home and have to deal with a line of 20 people before I could do my homework or play.I started hustling all the kids by selling everything for a quarter or 50 cents higher than my moms prices. I did this because we weren't aloud to have anything ourselves unless we paid for it.So 30 mins later I count my stash up which ranged from $5 to $10 and then I would buy myself whatever I wanted and go hide from my siblings and gorge.Directly behind our duplex was a storage facility that my mom used to store stuff that she would sell at auctions and flea markets. One night my mom and aunt bribed me with something along the lines of, "If you come work with us for a few hours we will give you some money and take you to the skating rink this weekend." Back then we didn't have computers and phones so if I wasn't at school I was outside playing in the woods twisting my ankles or stepping on jacket nests or at the skating rink. Needless to say I was down to hustle. Keep in mind I WAS SEVEN-ish.I hopped in the back of my moms van that night and we drove back to the storage units. My mom entered her access code and in we went. She parked at her storage unit and opened it so that it would look like we were just messing around with our stuff if someone else showed up, then we all walked over to a unit a ways away from ours. My mom used bolt cutters to pop the lock, tossed it in the woods and slowly opened the unit door. First unit had furniture packed to the roof up front but boxes in the back. My mom told me to climb through the furniture to the boxes and look for stuff like jewelry, guns, and electronics. So in I climbed flash light in hand as the door closed behind me. The only other thing I remember about that night is that I got a Playstation 1 out of it, and enjoyed the skating rink.Little did I know that this would only be one of the first scheme's my mom would have me be apart of and ultimately lead to me going to prison later in life. If you found this story intriguing and would like to know more about the experience's I've gone through feel free to follow this blog.resilientfelon.wordpress.com

 I was watching the bee movie in theaters a long time ago and during previews someone just comes in with a full on hazmat suit thing and a briefcase, I was confused.. he sat down like 2 seats directly in front of us , anyways so we start the movie and this dude is just sitting there with a popcorn and a drink with his hat on his other seat, so we are like a quarter through the movie and the bee was talking to this girl and the bee says "Ya like jazz" And as he said that the dude just stood up, put on his hazmat mask and just takes his briefcase and fucking opens it and like 500 bees just come flying out at us and some other people like what the hell so i ducked under the seat and got stung like 8 times and after they were all spread out I could see this dude with like 80 bees on him and he just runs down the ramp into the lobby and you can hear faint screams in the lobby. Imagine seeing some dude in a beekeeper suit running out at you with like 100 bees chasing him so everyone booked it, and the theater had to get shut down because there was dead bees everywhere and some were in the popcorn thing and crap, anyways I had to go to the hospital after cause i got stung so many times, they eventually caught this guy because a lady and her son reported a beekeeper with a bunch of bees on him running across traffic. I still laugh about it to this day.

Sorry, had to make it quick, will give more details if requested. When I worked for a local pest control company in my hometown, I once was asked by a customer if I was scared of cats. I simply and confidently stated "haha no. Who in there right mind is scared of cats". The guy said you'd be surprised. I shrugged it off and carried on spraying for ants and cockroaches. As I entered the back room I heard a thud from behind me and something roughly the size of a Great Dane (or other large dog breed) brushed up against my leg... it was a huge mountain lion. I was startled but I kept doing my job (a bit faster and probably not as thoroughly due to my eyes being locked on this giant F****** "cat") it was a very friendly animal tho (purring and such) but geeze what a surprise.

I keep seeing my sister Lisa in my dreams. Even though we're miles apart, I'm still haunted by her presence. Last year, my mom took Lisa in to help her raise her baby. I was excited to get to know Lisa since we rarely ever saw each other due to her drug addiction. Now she was clean and living with me and I got to spend time with my niece. It was hell. Lisa took advantage of my inability to say no, and it wasn't always about the baby. If she wanted to watch a movie, I had to watch it with her or else she'd accuse me of hiding in my room. She'd point out everything that I was doing. The way I eat, the way I sneezed, the way I prepared ramen, the way I did the dishes... I couldn't do anything without feeling like I was under surveillance. I was constantly being gaslighted. She'd accuse me of being too emotional because she would tell me that she was annoyed by me being scared. Who the hell says that? Lisa had a very bad temper when it came to messes. She'll yell at the dogs for having an accident in the house like it was the worst thing in the world. I was constantly checking the floor for dog pee. Not because she told me to, but because I wanted to keep the peace. Lisa tends to blame everyone but herself. One time, my niece spilled hot coffee on herself after her mom left it sitting on the couch. Guess who she blamed it on? She'd say terrible things to the baby. She'd threaten to spank her, say she makes her life shitty, call her a psychopath and a jackass, etc. It's been half a year since I last saw Lisa. Every now and then, I have dreams about her. As of this moment, I dreamt that she was moving back in for four days straight. I don't want to live with Lisa in the back of my head. I've come so far and now I wake up in fear. I don't know what to do.

This story took place when I was 8 years old. I'm female.We were learning about world war 2 and so on. We all had to do projects about WW2. I kind of slacked and just wrote down loads of random facts about hitler and a little bit of history. I was on this random site that had hitler facts. One fact was "Hitler only has one testicle". Me being the innocent child that I was. I just wrote it down thinking testacle means kidney or something. A few days go past and I finish my project. It's time to present it to my class. I read out the final facts "Hitler only had one testicle". Everyone started laughing. The teacher sort of laughed too. One of the boys said "testicles mean balls". My face went red and I literally ran into the bathroom. Luckily it was close to home time so when the bell went I grabbed my bag and walked home. I still get embarrassed thinking about it.I also posted the exact same thing to r/embarrassing_moments soo if you think you've seen this before that's probably why.

Last year, It was a normal Saturday and I was heading out to pre drinks before a friends 21st birthday party. Headed to the shops to get some drinks before I headed in, and as I was exiting the shopping centre down the escalators, the older gentleman in front of me collapsed, hit his head on the escalator railing and was unconscious. He had split his skull and blood had begun pouring out of his head, and he was was no laying in a pool of blood. Immediately, myself and another man rushed to the aid of the older gentleman. I called 000, and as I have done a basic first aid course, knew some things I needed to do in the situation. He was not breathing and had no pulse, so I began CPR and once I got tired, the other man took over, taking turns until the ambo's arrived. About 10 minutes later, 2 Ambo's on bicycles arrived to give immediate aid and take the situation over. 2 actual ambulances arrived about 5 minutes later, and it was determined that this man could not be saved and they stopped all life saving care. There he was, a man I never knew, drowned in his own blood, and image that is impacting my life in ways that still echo to today. After it happened, I was in shock and about 30 minutes later, realised that I was now driving my car to my mates place for pres. I'm sorry I couldn't do more to save you, I think about you everyday, I'm so sorry.

So I was told this story when I was about 10, living in Ireland in a town called Waterford, not to far from the coast. On this Coast there was a lighthouse and then just down the road an old mansion with a man sized hole in the roof. You can get a tour of the mansion where the story is also told but with props and actors. The story is set in the 1890-1910 eraThe story starts in the evening of a winter night, a family of 3 are playing poker around a circular table. They are enjoying themselves greatly until they are interupted by a knock at the door. The daughter (Shelia) heads downstairs to open the door, where she is confronted by a tall man with a large coat. Sheila: Oh, hello there Sir, may I help you?Man: Hello there dear, I was wondering if I could come in and stay the night. I have nowhere to go and it�s freezing out here.Sheila: Oh, of course. Come in! Come in!The man enters the house and is invited to play poker with the rest of the family to which he accepts. A new round is started, a new deck of cards shared out between the four people. The game begins and all is going well until Sheila drops one of cards on the floor, she apologises and leans down to pick it up, but before she can she jolts upright at begins to scream loud and does not stop for instead of the mans feet, she saw hooves. Shes shouting out what she saw and after a good 20 seconds had passed the man suddenly transformed into a red ball of fire.This ball of fire cursed the girl to never stop screaming and proceeded to fly around the room before shooting up through the roof and away into the distance. The parents of Shelia could not believe what they saw and tied up the girl only to then leave her in the basement on her own to starve and die. A priest was brought in to get rid any demons in the mansion but it is still unsure if this worked.They recently tried to repair the roof with fresh wooden planks, but as soon as the last plank was put in place, the fresh planks burst into flames to re-create the whole that was left 100 years earlier. I assume this story is fiction but you never know.

So my father has lived a very interesting, lucky, amazing life. Hes been around the world because of his service in the Navy. At only 19 years old, he was on board a fast-attack submarine and he got to visit Hong Kong, Brazil, Italy, Australia, and even crash through the ice in Antarctica, all in 4 years. In his mid-twenties after his service, he had no idea what he was going to do with his life, so he became a party animal. The following is one of his darker experiences.My dad spent a good amount of time in his mid-twenties travelling around the Midwest looking for places to get fucked up and have a good time. His buddy (we will call him Wade) called him up one day asked him if he wanted to go to an island in Wisconsin called Madeline Island. Of course my dad accepted.They took their Harley bikes up to Wisconsin and found a ferry that would take them across Lake Superior. My dad and Wade were so pumped to get there. They arrive just before sunset and speed off to check out the island and putt around for a bit. They rented a little house they could stay for a night. When it finally gets too dark to safely drive, the pull up to one of the three bars that were on the island and start to get into party mode. My dad was 2 Budweisers into the night when a gorgeous girl walks up to him and Wade. "Hey, you used to babysit me a few years ago! Remember me?" My dad was dumbfounded. This girl (who he did actually babysit) was from Arizona, and she just happend to be on this fucking island, on this night, renting out a house to stay. She is talking to my dad and Wade, and by that time all three of them were getting tipsy, when she brings up a big party that is going down on the opposite side of the island. My dad was a little hesitant at first, but Wade convinced him to go. Plus, my dad thought he was gonna smash this gorgeous 18 year old, so he was eventually all for it. They leave the bar with a stolen bottle of Fireball and head to the party on their Harleys.They get to the house where the party is and it is booming. Drunk teenagers dancing outside, music bumping from the house, everyone there is having a good time (My dad did end up sexing with that girl he babysat). At around 11 at night, some drunk group of guys all decide to order a huge amount of pizzas. Everyone agrees, including Wade and my dad. Pizzas arrive about 90 mins later and the drunk guys take the pizza into the house. My dad is high and considerably tipsy at this point, so he is devouring this shitty pizza, and so is his buddy Wade. After a shot, the two walk outside because the house is hot as fuck, and it starts.My dad is stumbling around the perimeter of the house with Wade when he starts to feel a bit off. He walks in circles for a bit before he realizes he cant find Wade. All of a sudden, the forest around the house starts to warp, like the trees were fluctuating. My dad is starting to freak out and walks to the front of the house. He looks at the sky and it seems really close to him, like its falling. All of a sudden Wade walks up behind him and scares the shit out of my dad. He asks him where the fuck he went and Wade said he had gone back in the house. My dad noticed that Wade looked mad as hell.My dad asks him: "Do you feel weird? I feel like everything is closing in on me, man."Wade explains to my dad that "that group of drunk fuckers" put shrooms on all of the pizzas that they ordered. Wade had done acid and shrooms before, so he figured it out in the house. But by that time, they were both tripping, hard. My dad needed some fresh air and there was a beach right by the house, so he stumbles over there, and the whole time Wade was telling him to come back. They put their arms on each others' shoulders and argue like two drunk idiots on that beach. Then they hear a sober voice yelling at them from by the house."GET THE FUCK OFF THAT BEACH, THATS SACRED LAND"My dad is tripping extremely badly so Wade has to drag him back to the house...over a roped area. They had jumped over the ropes that had guarded the sacred burial ground that is located on that beach. They had no idea.Wade starts to freak out, which makes my dad's (first) trip worse. They both agreed to get the fuck outta dodge.They hop on their Harleys and start heading down to their house on a narrow dirt road (which is a fucking atrocious idea when you're drunk, high, and tripping) and out of the blue there is this HUGE group of deer on the road, at least 150 deer just chillin there on the road. My dad, who is the lead bike, is yelling, honking, and acting like a madman trying to get these deer out of the road. These fuckers couldn't care less. My dad starts to freak out again so Wade takes the lead and starts pushing the deer out of the way! The deer finally disperse and they find a familiar area, finally.They get to their house and my dad is finally starting to come down. At around this time, Wade's decision making is fucked so hes like "let's go to a bar" which just happens to be around 150 yards away. They can see it through their window.A little background here, my dad and Wade are huge Vikings fans, and it happened to be the Viking-Packer game that night and was being replayed at the bar. They dressed up in their purple garb and headed over They get in the bar and EVERYONE is wearing packer garb. They get death stares from everyone in there, but they dont give a shit, they're wasted. After putting down shots, eating shitty barfood and being extremely loud, the whole bar gets hostile towards my dad and Wade. My dad was provoked as fuck and starts a verbal fight with everyone. The cook of the bar comes up from the kitchen and throws a jab and hits my dad's face. My dad is not only unphased, but also fuckin livid. He sobered up a bit in that moment and threatened to take it outside. They did, but the WHOLE FUCKING BAR came with too, and they were going to jump my dad and Wade. My dad said "fuck this" and tried to calm the mob down, because he does not want to die before he gets off this damn island. He actually defused the situation a little bit, but he took the cook out of the crowd and said "let's go."The cook is shitfaced and cant throw a straight punch, and my dad dodged them all. He gets an opening and lands a haymaker straight onto the cook's forehead. The cook was out before he hit the ground and is as stiff as a board, then un-tenses. My dad is proud for about 3 seconds until he realizes he might have just killed this guy. Freaking out, he pulls Wade out of the crowd of people outside (those people ended up fighting each other) and get back to their house. They peer through a window and see that the cook is still on the ground. My dad is extremely paranoid and Wade is having a hard time calming him down. After over half an hour, the cook finally twitches, gets up, and stumbles back to the bar. My dad is relieved but is shook up and cant sleep. By that time though, the sun was about to rise, so they just pack up and wait for the next ferry to arrive so they can get the fuck off the island.Sunrise hits and the ferry arrives. Wade and my dad pull up with their Harleys and get on. Right as the ferry is about to pull out of the docking area, a sherriff pulls up and walks onto the ferry. My dad is calm but fucking scared. The sherriff just looked talked to a few people, and looked straight into my dads eyes...and walked away. Fucking bullet dodged, but that felt weird. The ferry takes off and my dad and Wade are joking about the whole night until my dad looks to his left.On the far side of the boat, the cook was sitting there. No expression, no one around him, and he has a huge purple welt on the side of his forehead. My dad's heart is racing and the cook looks right at him. All of a sudden, it starts snowing really hard and the ferry is rocking. Someone comes up from the lower deck and is like "what the fuck" and Wade has a look on his face that says the same thing. Then in a split second, my dad can hear a huge crowd of voices all around him, and its getting louder and louder until he cant hear anything except the voices. Deafening at one second, then...gone the other. My dad was yelling all sorts of profanity at that point and asked Wade if he heard what he did...And they arrive back to shore. No snow, no cook, no voices. Wade is looking at him like he just saw his eyeballs pop out."Dude, you were screaming all the way back to shore, what the shit is wrong with you?"They calm down, grab a drink at another bar, and go their separate ways. To this day, my dad swears it was because he accidentally walked onto that Native American burial ground.TL:DR--My dad accidentally walked on an ancient Native American burial ground after he ate pizza laced with shrooms, and ended up seeing some bad shit. He got in a bar fight and barely escaped an island that he was stuck on.

So one day I got off the bus. My usual stop was near this gas station that is close to my house. So I start making my way to my house and everything seemed normal. When I walked past the gas station I got a glimpse of a homeless man in his 30's or so. He said,"Hey I have an offer!". I walked up to him because I had a pocket knife and wasn't scared. He opened a bag and there were 3 kittens,he said,"I take care of them everyday but I don't have enough money to care for them,to buy food and stuff. Want one? They are free." I took one and gave him a 20$ dollar bill because I felt bad. The kitty was a black one with white paws and a white belly. I named him Jerry and he is a cat that loves attention but meows a little too much and is a very energetic cat and he also has these adorable blue eyes. I haven't seen the homeless man after that but it's been 2 years since I got my cat.Thanks guys for the upvotes! I've only joined reddit a month ago this is the most upvotes i've gotten. I hope you enjoyed my story!

Never posted this story from my school days before and my mates seemed to think it was great when i told them the story a few days ago so i'm going to share it here.Back in secondary school during a very boring IT class i was thinking about GTA San Andreas and what new mods i was going to download when i got home. Then i came to the conclusion why wait till i got home why not play it there and then in IT class. Then realizing that the school system had restricted access to content. This was a problem. If only i had access to an administrators account i could stop them from stopping us.That night i went home and with very little computer knowledge i googled how to make a keylogger. For those that don't know what a keylogger is its a simple program that runs in the background and copy's every key input into a notepad file so you can view it later. I also made a copy of GTASA and put them both onto a USB Drive. When i went into school the next day i had everything i need on the USB drive i just needed access to an teachers computer. I got my friends to start a fake fight so the teacher would have to separate them and take the outside the room. &#x200B;The plan worked, the teacher had left the classroom here was my chance. I ran over to the computer which was still unlocked and inserted the USB and ran the keylogger, i locked the computer after i had done this so i could see the username and password being typed. I Retrieved the USB later on in class hoping that everything was saved and to my surprise, the program worked the first line of text was the username and password! i was in! now for the fun part. &#x200B;There was a program that enabled teachers to lock out all computers and stop access to students so i flipped that around and locked my teacher out of her account playing it cool so that it looked like a bug in the system and not that someone had purposely done it to her. i then uploaded GTASA to the shared school server and made it appear as a MyMaths Program. I then spread the news around the school about the hidden GTASA file in the shared server and to be smart while using it. So every lesson here was me thinking i was the dog bollocks, Full unrestricted access to the school system. Any website i wanted to visit i could. Uploading new games every day to the shared servers. Kids coming up to me with all kinds of requested and saying how awesome it was that i had done this, i felt unstoppable like a stupid 14y/o does. Thats when they brought in a professional IT Engineer to find out what was going on.&#x200B; It didn't take him long to find that there was a lot of traffic going to a MyMaths Program on a shared server so he opened the app and to his surprise there was GTASA so he looked at who uploaded it and found it was my teacher which clearly wasn't right but he could also see the time it was uploaded and from which computer inside the building. Which lead him to the sign-in history of the device and there was me logging out in the middle of a lesson and my teacher logging into the same machine. He got me. I was then excluded for 2 weeks and a week of isolation when i returned and wasn't aloud to take IT as my option in the final year and just like that my 2 weeks of fame was gone.Anyway that was my story sorry that its long winded and the punctuation/grammar is incorrect.&#x200B;

 It was my freshman year of high school, we were in the middle of year. It�s a normal day and I walk to my history class. My teacher, a local legend, a German, and a state champion in wrestling, was about 60 at the time. He was such a sweetheart and taught it such an understanding way, anyways, we go upon our class as usual and we get done talking about a topic so then my teacher walks over to his desk to pull up the video ( where I go to school we use projectors and you have this little remote where you can press the, �freeze� button to freeze the screen so you can show students specific things and not let them see your screen continuously, but of course my teacher didn�t know how to use that ) he opens up Google to look up the video and comes across a website and starts reading it to us. As he scrolls on the website on the side an ad pops up that causes the class hoot with laughter, it was a porn ad. My teacher immediately tried to exit out of the ad and he accidentally clicked on it, so yeah we watched about 5 seconds of porn until my teacher could figure out how to exit it.

I have always had a hard time understanding and communicating with people, maybe it was my internal dialogue that prevented me from speaking my mind, or maybe I was just a boring guy. Plenty of people enjoy my company, but I myself do not, thus I have been more of a quiet observer that stays out of the spotlight. Granted I smoke copious amounts of weed despite my constant anxiety which is more than likely the real reason I'm quiet.Anyway, I have only recently moved to seattle after living in a small town my whole life, if I could describe it in words, busy, hectic, and sonic, everything's got to move fast, everyone's got somewhere to be, and everybody is minding their own business. This is weird to me as I'm used to everyone knowing everything about me, the exact opposite of city life. I thought maybe I'll get used to it, but only time will tell. Well to remedy my loneliness, I unashamedly went on bumble to make freinds, girls tend to be a lil flaky, but guys are willing to meet whether bi, straight, gay and do stuff, it's kinda fun to, I had this cool guy hmu and wanted to hang, it was a weekend and I had nothing better to do, so I hang at his house and surprisingly hes pretty easy to talk to, after awhile he breaks out the vodka and I proceed cautiously, I have a low tolerance so I find that going light is always the best option.We continue to hangout and start playing some video games when his brother gets home, he casually greets himself and set himself up to play with us, we get tired of playing and make plans to go to a club, this is a new expierience to me, number 1. I have never been to a club before, well I have, I had a bouncer buddy sneak me in one time, but I only snuck in the side and never got to get out, but I wasnt old enough to be in there so I held a low profile, this time I was old enough and had people to dance around with. We decide I am designated dd as I know my limit and head to the club, it was cool at first it had an arcade attached so I ended up beating everyone at some street fighter 2 and some table hockey, then we got to the club and honestly was kinda let down.Everybody there looked to old to be there, all the girls kept to themselves and the guys were to shy to approach any of them, I wasnt really trying to do anything with anyone but everyone stayed in their own respective group and refused to dance with others, this is exactly opposite that I thought would happen, I wasnt really digging it so I went outside and rolled a j (sidenote, the coat lady stole my weed)After getting back I decided to get some water at the bar, in the time I waited, I got some very interesting observations of people, there was a young couple that clearly bribed the guards to get in, an old lady who was going ham on the dance floor, a middle aged couple clearly there for the wife's midlife crisis, and alot of business people that look like they came from the Microsoft building.It truly amazes me at the age difference in the club, most all the girls were closed off with their people, there were groups of guys clearly there looking to hook up, and the obvious couple that is looking to spice up their life, I had the middle aged couple approach me, the wife was kinda into me, but I had a responsibility to get the guys home safe and I would rather not leave them to fend for themselves, I then herded my dudes together, got them all to drink water then got them to the carThey got home safe and my job was doneDont know if anyone will wanna read this but if you do Peace love and happiness manMight not ever go to the club againTldr hippy goes to club and monologues the entire time

I was talking to the girl I like and started running out of things to say (note this was on messenger) so I asked her if she knew how to calculate the circumference of a circle, which she said no to, and I just gave her the equation. After awhile the conversation started dying and we ended on Kobe�s death story. Lol I just found it funny so I wanted to share this



******************************



So this story happened 2 years ago now but it's important for later,When I was 16 I was going through allot of depression, girlfriend dumped me and I was a big time alcoholic but after about a month I started getting back on my feet, kicked the drinking and I was working out everyday as much as i could, i had a friend (we'll call him kevin) who had a girlfriend that we all disliked (we'll call her Tanya)she just made hanging out with kevin so much more of a chore.So after 8 months of telling us that he was gonna break up with her he finally did, 2 months after he broke up with her is where the story catches up to my recovery phase, I was really happy, Tanya asked to come hangout one day and it seemed like she had gotten better at dealing with her emotions (she was very prone to public freakouts in highschool) so I decided that I'd try to salvage whatever friendship we had left, we hung out all day playing Lego Indiana Jones and listening to music, we were actually really similar in our music tastes so it was a really cool to see her happy, I guess her relationship with my buddy was a big stress on both of them, so it's almost 12 at night and she lived on the other side of the city, I didnt drive at the time so bussing was the only option but the busses in my city are always sketchy so I offered for her to sleep over... the only regret I have from highschool.I was still trying to forget about my ex so when Tanya asked me to have sex with her at 2 am I was weak, it's hard to admit it even now but I knew I shouldn't have and I did, so fast forward to the morning you could call it guilt but I started crying and after I made breakfast I asked if she wouldn't mind going home.A week goes by and I get a call from my other friend telling me that Tanya has been saying that I raped her.I've been getting threats ever since, i'm scared to tell people how I feel about them because I feel like if I let people in they'll fail me, I have never taken advantage of a female but now I have so much anxiety about having sex that even with my current girlfriend I just can't most of the time, I'll lie to her that I'm too tired, I'd rather just watch youtube, If i have so much as a drop of alcohol or she does then I can't, so to bring the story full circle it's been 2 years since this girl broke my trust, 2 years since the threats started, 2 years since I lost all of my friends to this, so in your opinion, how far should a grudge go?

So, I'm gonna start this off with Vodka makes me completely blackout drunk anytime I drink it. Anyways, I'm a freshman in college, and I decided it would be great for me to make friends with the upperclassman and of course, they throw wild parties. I was invited to one and I had never had hard alcohol before that night, so that was already gonna be bad. I had no idea what my tolerance was so I had a few too many drinks, and I made a mistake that ruined my whole life... I cheated on my boyfriend in front of the whole party by making out with someone on the couch. After that night, I told him immediately what I did and he forgave me and we were okay, even if I felt terrible for what I did. However, my "friends" went behind my back and started talking non-stop trash about me because one person was spreading something that wasn't true and they chose to believe them over me because I'm new to the group. I feel really bad for what I did, but also I feel like absolute trash because my "friends" don't like me or even want me around. I just wish I knew what to do because I feel all alone.

Back when I was an undergrad, I had a roommate with Williams syndrome who I�ll call Erica. This meant that among a host of physical difficulties she had to deal with, Erica also had mental handicaps and often reacted to new problems with solutions you�d expect a child to resort to, not a grown woman in her twenties.One evening, our other roommate, who I�ll call Amy, was stressed and fluttering about our apartment�s tiny kitchen, trying to get a nice homemade lasagna dinner ready for a guy she had invited over.I was in my room doing homework when I hear a panicked Amy calling for assistance. I go into the hallway. There is a powerful poo smell radiating in warm noxious waves from the bathroom. Out walks our roomie Erica, wearing nothing but the emperor�s new clothes and trailing strands of brownish toilet paper like a cape. She says, �Sorry girls,� as she proceeds to our shared room.I peep into the tiny bathroom space to find an entire roll of toilet paper � still mostly intact � soaked in diarrhea. The toilet bowl, inside and out, is running with it, along with the floor, the sides of the shower and tub, as well as the shower curtains. It was like the inside of a slaughterhouse, but spattered with poop instead of blood.�There�s no f-ing way I�m cleaning that up,� Amy says.I grew up the oldest of a large family, and am no stranger to cleaning up poo messes. I rolled up my sleeves, fetched cleaners and a rag, and went to work. Soon the bathroom was put to rights again.When I came back out to the kitchen, Amy was so overjoyed I had taken care of the mess that, in gratitude, she let me eat dinner with her and her date (Amy was the sort of roommate that rarely if ever shared anything). �Thanks for taking one for the team,� she said.

True story. Me (M) made out with one of my best friends (F). I was spending the night at her house because she had a cookie baking party and there was 6 of us there. The other one of the the three boys left, that was the boy she liked/didn�t like in our group. Leaving me her two other girls and one other boy. I had been drinking but it was a few hours ago so I wasn�t feeling it anymore really, still though I wasn�t all there. The others were laying down on the floor watching the movie, but me and her were up planing to sleep on opposing side of the couch. The clock hit around 2 and the others in the floor were completely out, snoring and all. I was still up and she was in and out of being awake and not. I then asked her, when she was awake, if she wanted to cuddle kind of joking and not at the same time. She said yes and we snuggled up together. Her legs wrapped between mine. I became a little uncomfortable by how I was positioned and I moved. My leg, when I moved, brushed against her parts, and she breathed in in a fashion giving off a shocked but pleased vibe. So I did it again to check and see if I picked up the vibe correctly. I did. Apon realizing this I was filled with emotion, confused by lust that I�ve never felt for this person before. Asking myself, wish are you cuddling with her, why did she do that, why did she say yes to cuddling, why did you ask? Ignoring my best judgment I asked her if she wanted to kiss. She said laughing why, and I truthfully replied �I don�t know, but I really want to for some reason. If you don�t wanna that�s ok.� She said ok and we kissed for a couple of seconds. All the while my heart and mind are bursting from conflicting opinion. The. We stopped like all things do and that was that until my hands started to move hand on the outer thigh and she said nothing implied consent I think lol, then to her stomach. Her hoodie was slightly raised so my hand was in her skin. The. My hand moved up upon her breast with a slight squeeze. Her bra was off because it was making her uncomfortable earlier in the night before all of this. Then my mind started thinking �what was that, do you like her, what are we now, what is this going to change� and then it thought � do it again kiss her, why not.� So I listened and asked once more she replied �sure� I presume as confused as I was. It was not the best make out sesh I�ve had by far. She and I were not that good, but I�ll chalk that up to us being tired because it was 3 am and me being slightly fuzzy for drinking earlier. This being said though we kissed and I moved from her mouth to her neck and right before I gave her a hicky, I realized that would be a problem because everyone would find out so I stopped and we just started kissing again. Once done we cuddle for a bit longer, when I was about to fall asleep I moved back to my side of the couch as to not alude to our friends of our actions last night. While doing so I said to her �we need to talk about this� she said �ya we do� in a laughing type tone. I said �later tomorrow� and then I said �goodnight.� We woke up and I said goodbye to all my friends and left in my car quickly. Feeling awkward, and changing cloths in my car while going to church. And I�m during church I messaged her if we could talk. �About what� when she said that I was really confused thinking that I just had a vivid dream, but I said about what happened last night and the conversation left me confused. We talked about how she still had feeling for the boy that had left earlier that night and that she�s all ways felt like me and her would be better as friends, and we agreed not to tell anyone. I told my two closet friends ,that could care less, and now I�m telling redit. I told my friends because I was about to break down from confusion and I telling you because I want to here your opinions and insight on my mishaps and mistakes. |sorry for grammar and spelling| ((((((TLDR I made out with and felt up my female best friend, and am now confused about my relationship with her))))))

 Words mean nothing. They are just empty promises, characters, symbols on the paper. They are just phonetics, different ways to get your mind out. Words are associations. Illusions.*Worthless, pointless, inconvenient, bothersome, neglected. Forsaken. Mishap, mistake, misfit, consequence, valueless.*They all mean nothing. The meaning behind them is what you are made to believe. If something has been told you repeatedly, like a mantra, you start to repeat it to yourself. The words mean nothing, if the actions contradict with them.*Beloved*. No I'm not. Why would I be, when everyone telling me so are acting in a completely different way. They tell me they love me yet they only regard me when it's in their favor. They don't value me really, they just try to make themselves look good.If words truly meant something, the actions behind them wouldn't matter. But they do. Actions define whatever you are trying to tell someone. You can't say you hate someone yet kiss them goodbye lovingly. You can't say you value something yet leave it unattended.Trust me. I know.After a long time of only rain and gray, the sun finally tore the heavy clouds into oblivion as she rose, kissing my cheeks with her rosy, golden light. She painted the sky with gentle pinks and blues, yellows and oranges when the new morning pushed the night away. It was too blissful to be disregarded or to be left without a wide-eyed watcher who had been staying up the whole night. I couldn't believe the beauty that was scattered over the nearly perfectly circular clearing in the middle of the forest, where the ground had flowers of many colours and the grass was emerald green. The little body of water was sparkling cheerfully. Only I was cold in this morning of new awakening.I knew I had to get back to the castle soon, not that anyone would have noticed my absence but rather because Aywin wanted me to be there for his birthday. As if there was a reason to celebrate it when everyone around us were dying, crumbling, becoming only ashes and dust. It was a wonder I was able to move in the forest so safely without anyone finding me and tearing me apart - then again, they probably didn't care either. After all i was just the bastard son of the king, no matter how much I tried to be something more. I'd never be anything else and everything and everyone in the palace kept reminding me of that. They probably wouldn't care if I didn't come home.   It was always just about Aywin.I walked through the heavy wooden front doors of the palace. The guards had thrown them open as they had noticed the spawn of the king approaching, no matter how much they would have wanted to keep me unnoticed. I wasn't officially a prince nor were they obligated to obey my orders. I was just simply one resident living in the castle. And once inside I saw all the commotion in the hall - everyone hustling over the young boy with beautifully braided brown hair. He was dressed in elegant, expensive robes that complimented his every feature from the perfect facial features to his proportionate body. He was a couple decades younger than I was. I should have been the next heir to the crown.But no one cared about me and my auburn hair and fawn-like proportions. No one cared about my appearance in the crowd, not the dirty clothes I was wearing, not the bare feet I had. But maybe that was for the best, after all. I let them all disregard me all they wanted. There was just one elf I wished wouldn't have brushed me aside so easily. But he wasn't there, so there was nothing to hope. I could just escape, flee the scene, run away.And so I did. In the labyrinth of elves I slithered through into my chambers where I knew no one would come if they were attending Aywin's birthday celebration. Why would they if they had the possibility to eat and drink, laugh and dance all night? To make a point, I didn't hate being alone. I just found it to be rather more pleasant than a ton of people around me, invading my personal space. I liked talking to them yet sometimes they said I'm rude and it's no wonder anyone wanted to engage a conversation with me. Again, words don't mean anything before you make them mean something. And I'd rather be considered rude than a spoiled brat.I flopped down to lie on my bed, long legs dangling idly off the edge. I cradled my head on my arms, staring at the ceiling without any interest to look around in my room. There was no reason for me to look at the same walls I had already seen and stared at until they had become knackered in my mind. Why should I look around only to see the same armchair I had spent so many days in staring at the walls? Because they held some precious memories? As if.A sharp knock on my door woke me up from a dream I didn't realize I had fallen into. Rubbing my eyes feeling baffled I sat up staring at the door, wondering whether or not I had actually heard it. Then someone knocked again.   "Come in," I said and yawned as someone stepped into my chambers, closing the door behind them. Then. I blinked, looking at the elegantly dressed figure standing right by the door as if he was unsure was he allowed to stand there.   "You weren't at the party," Aywin remarked carefully, hiding his hands behind his back. I blinked, bewildered.   "I uhh... I fell asleep," I replied. I ran my hand through my hair as my little brother sat next to me on my bed. He looked genuinely upset.   "I'm sorry," I rushed to add before I was going to get a lecture from him how I disrespected the crown prince or something.   "I know you didn't want to come, Alvis," he sighed before flopping to lie, just like I had done before. That made the sharp stab of pressuring guilt run through me. I grimaced.   "But it wasn't about you. I just-"   "Don't like being where the people are, I know that very well."   "Did... You have something on your mind or did you just want to see me?"   "I wanted to see you. And I wanted to ask you something," he said, closing his green eyes. I looked at him, dumbfounded, not able to figure out my brother's thoughts.   "Uh-huh? And what's that?" I asked, trying to sound like I'd have the answers for any kind of question Aywin could ever come up with - like every big brother.   "Do you remember when we were little? When you used to make all those pillow forts with me before Father told us to stop?" he said, his tone being too casual for him to be actually concerned about that matter. Was he trying to chit-chat?   "Of course I do. Why wouldn't I?"   "I was just wondering. It's not like I ever told you how much I enjoyed those moments with you. Now it feels like we're standing on two floes and there's this deep, icy ocean between us," Aywin remarked, his voice suddenly sounding strained as if he had to fight to get them out of his throat. But he wasn't wrong, he was the farthest thing from it. Our relationship had become more formal over the years. I had been building a wall between us to keep my own vanity and envy away from him.  "Then it's a good thing I love cold water", I just said. I wasn't able to say anything else, I was speechless. My words had drowned in the icy sea between us, they were gone. My ability to speak vanished with them.And way too soon was my brother vanished with them too and now it's too late. I had the possibility to say anything else, to make it right, to fix things. Yet I didn't. I had nothing to say. Or I didn't have nothing to say, I just didn't know how to say them. Words don't mean anything before it's too late to say them. They mean nothing before you can't say them again. They mean nothing before you can't show you mean them.The pillow forts we built and made crumble had turned into real falling forts that had crushed him under their weight. They could have taken me as well, or rather instead, but maybe it was a punishment for me. For not saying the words then, when I had the possibility.Only because I thought they mean nothing.   //I posted this on Wattpad ( [https://www.wattpad.com/user/satuprinsessa\_](https://www.wattpad.com/user/satuprinsessa_) ) last week but thought I'd like to post this here as well! English isn't my first language, so excuse my grammar.

In the year 2011 there was a vicious drought in East Texas. The worst I had seen in my lifetime. 100 degree days on end and no rain all summer long. I had a water hose, probably 150 ft in length, stretched out to the cow trough in order to keep them watered. Had to run it every day.On one random day I had the cow water running and took a peak through the glass on the front door and there I noticed something. The hose had a small leak and was spraying a fine stream at an angle, watering a very small sliver of the yard, perhaps two by two feet, for the entire 15 minutes it took to fill the trough. I then noticed this four square feet of flourishing grass, thick, lush and green, growing strong, while the entire surrounding yard and greater pasture all lay dead and withered down to no more than straw.It was here I considered the millions upon millions of blades of grass in that 40 acre expanse of yard and pasture. And of the multitude this 4 square foot patch thrived. And I squinted my eyes and saw one long blade sticking up higher than the rest, right in the middle. I figured he was the tallest and greenest blade of grass for miles around, maybe even in the entire county. How many billions of blades of grass lay within that expanse? And here he sits, the tallest and mightiest blade, with a perfectly green hue. Reckon he thinks he�s that way of his own accord? How many countless thousand would have him in their shade if they were to get half the water.

Are you stuck?�There's so many people that are stuck in their lives. You're stuck in a bad job that you hate. You go to a job your can't stand because your stuck, you can't make a change, fear keeps you stuck there. Fear is the biggest glue out there, it's better than gorilla glue and super glue combined, it will keep you stuck in so many things.Fear will keep you stuck in a relationship that you know no longer works for you. But you stay because your afraid no one else will love you, that you won't make it on your own.�There are people that are stuck with friends that are pulling them down and not uplifting and supporting them. People stay with them because they knew them "when" because the friendship is so old even though it is not serving you anymore.The biggest place we get stuck is within ourselves, sometimes we are our own worst enemy.We are stuck on things that happened in our past, things that we can't get over.�We are stuck in anger, stuck in fear, we're stuck in bitterness and unforgiveness. We are stuck in the why me? It's a fight so many people can't get past and it weights down their lives, it keep replaying in their heads.When something went wrong in their lives and they're constantly blaming someone else for their pain.I know my ex-mother-in-law is stuck on the fact that my ex father-in-law found somebody else and divorced her...40 years ago! She still can't get over that fact and she talks about it all the time. Anytime you call� and talked to her, guaranteed she'll tell you that same story, that you've heard a million times from 40 years ago because she's stuck in that moment and she never moved on.I know my grandmother as well was stuck in a moment where my grandfather left her. That moment left her hating all men for the rest of her life, even� poisoning my mother's and my mind along with her. Every time she spoke of my grandfather or men in general, she went on a rampage about that they were all bad, they were all dogs and they were all useless.�This made her stuck in negativity and bitterness her whole life, but this taught me a valuable lesson, that I knew early on that I never wanted to be that unhappy and negative and so that shaped me into the positive person I am today. I could have easily gone the other way following her footsteps.Like my ex-husband had, he, just like his mother is stuck in bitterness and pettiness because he can't get over the fact that I wanted a divorce, so he carries around his hatred for me, even years later. See how this can be a generational curse?I could have easily been stuck in unforgiveness for my rapist, because of him and what he did� to me, it led me down a path of drugs and alcohol and it nearly killed me. I could have let that moment keep me stuck but I chose to forgive.�I could have been stuck in hatred for my ex-husband because he verbally abused me for 24 years but I chose to let go, to forgive him and move on.Yes, you can chose, see that word I love so much...chose, choice, it's something we all have within us but it's up to us to use it. Look let's be real we all have our stories, like I always say insert your sob story here...Sorry if that sounds harse but it's true, we all have a sob story. Your parents were alcoholics. they beat you, you were dirt poor, you were abused, sexual assaulted, your family put you down, you were abandoned... whatever your story is, trust me there is someone out there with a story that will make yours look good.But either you can hold on, be stuck in the I'm a victim mode or you can chose to forgive, to let it go and move on. You can be your own superhero, you can chose to be a survivor, you can chose to break the generational curse you are stuck in, like I did.It is easy to get stuck in patterns that don't serve us, do you realize it only takes 21 days to start a pattern in your life? Yes, in only 21 days you can change your life. You can change the way you think about diet and exercise in 21 days. You can also get stuck in hatred, in bitterness, in negativity if you think about that for 21 days.So today my friends remember the choice is yours, don't let your mistakes, your failures, your upbringing, the things people have done to you or even your own stinking thinking keep you stuck.Just like the good witch told Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz..."You always had the power inside of you, my child"So do you.



******************************



     I am 18 years old and I recently left my mom�s house to live at my dad�s apartment. This is my first story btw, and it�s gonna be lengthy, sorry about that.     My parents have been divorced for about 9 years. It was a bad divorce too. My mom absolutely hated my dad and wanted nothing to do with him, so she followed the court order and never allowed a second more of time with my dad. I have two younger siblings and they were very young so they were never close to my dad like I was. They loved my stepdad though. He is a great guy and makes my mom super happy. I liked him too, but I could never call him �dad�. I would refer to him to people as dad but never call him that. I don�t know why.     Before I turned 18, I planned on no longer visiting my dad and stepmom. I knew it�d make my mom happy and proud of me, so I told myself that I will stop. So when the day came, I secretly went to lunch with my dad and stepmom and asked my boyfriend to come along (at the time they didn�t know I was dating anyone so to them he was a friend). On the previous weekend, I packed all of my belongings from their apartment and moved it to my mom�s. So at the meal, they knew it was going to be a while until they saw me again. My stepmom (Danielle) slipped me a blue sticky note with their numbers, emails, and address on it telling me that I can contact them if I ever needed them. At the time, I remembered thinking that I would never need it and would throw it away once I get home.     Once 18, my mom and stepdad told me that I would get a name change, get birth control, a bank account, a drivers license, and a job before summer ended (I was told that my dad never signed off that I could do any of those things since he shared custody with my mom). I was so happy and excited. My mom was happy with me and said I made the right decision.  I applied to a couple of places and went on one practice driving lesson that summer. I did get a job, but it was the night before school started (I still have it currently). And during that summer, my mom and stepdad got more and more angrier with me and my relationship.     I�ve been with my boyfriend for a year and a half at the time. We insanely loved each other and still do. But my mom never approved of him (other reasons that I could write about if you want) and when it was his birthday, I begged to go see him. And I hated begging, so she let me. And keep in mind that I haven�t been able to see him all summer besides me sneaking him over for a few minutes a week while they were at work. That was the only time I was allowed to see him that summer and it was making me and my bf mad. Eventually, my bf came to my house at 9 pm and asked if we could talk all together. But my stepdad sent him away and both parents yelled at me. I got grounded that night and got my tablet (that my bf got me for an anniversary) taken away so I had no chance of contacting him.      I would sneak messages to him telling him that I was so sorry. My stepdad agreed to meet him at Starbucks one morning. While we waited, he called my mom. After the call, she burst into my room saying that my bf told my stepdad that I was sleeping with him. I said yes and she called me stupid. As I was crying, she told me that I was forbidden to be with him and she�d call the police if he stepped on our property.     Over the summer, I was shunned and told repeatedly that I was stupid and a disappointment. I was so alone and scared of losing my bf. One day, my bf asked to speak with me. My stepdad asked me to step outside for a bit. Later that night, my mom told me that while my stepdad and bf were on the phone, my bf started yelling at him and ended the phone call with fuck you and hung up. It was incredibly disrespectful and I couldn�t believe it. My bf would never do that, but my stepdad would never lie. Especially when he looked so angry and ready to punch someone. I still refused to break up with my bf (especially since I don�t have his side of the story), so my mom told me that if I don�t break up with him when school starts, she will not pay for my college tuition and I was to leave her house when I graduate high school and never come back.      Over the final few weeks of summer, my bf and I talked about what happened and he was just defending himself and wanted to be able to date me. Repeatedly over summer, he�d try to break up with me so I could go to college and be happy. But I told him that I loved him and he was my happiness. Plus, it wouldn�t have solved anything.     When school started, I got an unexcused  absence and a tardy in the first week. Granted, I couldn�t find a class after looking for it a good amount of time, so I went to go sleep with my bf somewhere (we didn�t have sex for a good while so I couldn�t help myself). The tardy was being late to a class by ten seconds. After a week, my mom asked where I was having sex since I couldn�t do it in a bed. I wanted to be honest with her, so truthfully I said underneath the bleachers (which we did once!!). She was very pissed and thought I was doing it all the time underneath there. She called me a slut and said I could get arrested for that. Seeing that I could never be truly honest with her, I left to go to my room and away from her.      At that point, I was beginning to break. Insults kept coming at me almost everyday and they believed that I was a slut who would spread her legs to some boy in the dirt (something my mom said to me btw at a dinner one time). There was one day when my parents were in a good mood and took me to the DMV to get a learners permit. But after that, it just kept getting worse.     I started missing my dad and wished so badly to get away from everything. One might, my mom cursed at me and called me a slut and stupid. She told me that I wouldn�t amount to anything and she was going to think about calling the cops on me and having me switch schools so I could stop seeing my bf and talking to him. I was so mad, pissed, and sad that I held a pair of scissors in my hand and stared at it long and hard. It would be so easy to end it and what would my mom do? I didn�t hurt myself. I put the scissors down and went to bed still upset. The next day, I finally broke.      I was full on sobbing and crying once my parents went to work, the kids were at their weekly visit to my dad, and I was home alone with my youngest brother (half brother). I took my phone from my mom�s closet and called my bf and told him everything. He told me that I needed to leave and I shouldn�t be taking that abuse from her. Knowing that he was right, I began looking for anything that had my dad�s information on it. I opened a drawer and noticed something bright blue on the bottom. I pull it out and sob in relief that I didn�t throw away the little paper of their numbers. I emailed my stepmom and I gave my bf her number to call her.      Once she answered my bf, I waited for him to call me back and tell me what was going to happen. He called me back and told me that he told her just about everything. She really wanted me back with her and my dad and to get me out of that environment immediately. So the next day, I packed up a tote and a couple of bags full of as many belongings as I could carry. I was happy but also scared to leave. I knew that I would never see them again and I could never see my little brother grow up. I loved him and I wanted to see him turn into a great guy, but I couldn�t stay. During that day, neither of my parents noticed what I was doing since they ignored me.      At the end of the day, I thought I was going to puke and kept telling myself I could do it. When my stepdad was asleep, I asked my mom to come into my room. She probably took note of my bare walls and clear dresser that something was up. I told her that I no longer wanted to be here and wanted to move in with my dad. She said no without a second of thinking. She told me that it was hurtful to say that and that I only wanted to leave so I could stay with my bf. I told her no and that I was no longer happy here. She laughed and told me that it was my fault that I felt that way and left the room.      With the tablet that I took from her room, I texted my bf what happened. He asked me if he should call my dad to come get me, but I said that could end badly. My mom would call the police and that would not end well. But he insisted that I leave that night. So I told him to go ahead and tell my dad to help me. So while I was eating my last meal with my family (the kids came home that night), my stepdad yelled that I was ungrateful and a stupid child. He left the table and I was terrified. He looked ready to punch somebody. My mom told me that he was very angry and that I lost him. We heard him laugh in the other room and he came in with my mom�s phone.      It read that my dad was across the street and was here to get me. And that he contacted the police and wanted no trouble in front of the kids. My mom began crying and both parents were yelling at me. My stepdad yelled at me to get out of his house, so I went to my room and grabbed as much as I could carry and exited the house as my mom was crying and talking as quickly as she could on the phone with my dad, trying to discourage him of taking me by telling him all the bad stuff about me and my bf.      Once outside, I didn�t know what to do. Before I could leave for good, my mom came outside. I will never forget this:     �Here�s my phone�, she sets it on the ground by her feet. �Call him and tell him to leave and come back inside. Or you can leave and never come back. You will never see Jameson grow up or be a part of this family.� She leaves the phone and goes back inside the house, closing the door behind her.     I stare at the phone for a bit, then the window where they were most likely watching me, and then to the parking lot across the street where my dad most likely was.     If I did decide to go back inside, nothing would ever be the same again. And things would just get worse and who knows what will happen to me. So I picked up my bag, sling it onto my shoulder and said a silent goodbye as I walked away.     Once I reached my dad and stepmom, I cried and sobbed. As we drove to the city they lived in (15 minutes away). I told them everything and what happened and they were mortified and upset with everything. We eventually arrived at my bf�s house and he folded me into his arms as I sobbed harder. His parents came out and started talking to my dad and stepmom. I went into my bf�s room with him and he held me as a cried and comforted me with words. Telling me that the hard part was over, he was proud of me, and he loved me.      As the days went on, my bf was allowed over whenever he wanted and I got the things that I really needed. Within the first month I got: a phone, the birth control implant, I�m starting driving lessons, and I�m getting a new birth certificate so I can get a bank account. My dad and stepmom love my bf and see that he�s a great guy and sees the love I have for him. My mom does email my dad to get him to kick me out or �see the real me�. It hasn�t fazed him and he still loves and cares for me. I got the majority of my belongings back and I do see my siblings every other weekend, but things are awkward and will be for a while.     I do still love my mom and miss my baby brother very much. I wish her a lifetime of happiness, but I don�t have the stomach to see her yet. I�m sure (I�m hoping) that one day I�ll get to see her and talk to her about everything as adults.     But for now, I�m incredibly happy and so comfortable in my new home with my dad and stepmom. And my bf and I will be celebrating our two year anniversary very soon. I�m sorry this was very lengthy and hope that you read begging to end and if you have any questions just let me know.

Yesterday I was at a party that I went to with an E-bike. The battery was like 37km left when arrived. The distance was 11km to get home. After some time I�m already feeling drunk and we decided to play beer-pong but with wodka instead (I will call it killer-pong from now). Don�t need to say that after that it got fuzzy. And the next thing I know I�m actually on my bike battery is empty, riding in a completly wrong direction like 17km from my house.



******************************



this happened not even 10 minutes ago.  i'm chilling here browsing Reddit and there's these whacks i hear coming from the door like someones ramming a dildo in the doorknob. only my brother and i are home so i look through the peephole and see a dude in a black Tampa bay rays hat looking down and back over his shoulder. i"m confused at first then it clicks. all the lights are out and its dead silent. my dogs have their heads cocked and are just as confused as we are. whacks are still going like one every 20ish seconds. i point to my parents room and make a finger gun, my brother runs off to grab the pistol my parents keep. i look back through the peephole and see this skinny ass looking dude adjusting his hat. i go to turn the knob and i see all my veins popping out. i let got and i"m shaking. the reality of this all sets in and i breather while my brother comes back with the pew pew machine. i take it in my right hand and throw the door open. i keep my right hand (with the gun) behind the door and i say " the fuck are you doing here?". this guy is about half a head shorter than me so he backs off then turns and runs TO A RUNNING CAR IN THE DRIVEWAY.  the car speeds off and i"m still standing there trying to wrap my head around what happened.  my brother pries one of those saw looking keys from the door. i close it, lock it and put the gun back.  hes helping me write this and says i said something along the lines of "fubck yer ding hwere".  my adrenaline is still pumping but i hope this was interesting!

I was 11 at the time, there were 4 of us all together. We walked a friend home and started heading back to the park, the 3 of us had to walk past a small estate with one road that was the exit and entrance. While walking past it, a car with a long scratch on the side pulled up next to us, it was a black audi. 2 passengers got out and greeted us, they asked if we'd scratched their car. Obviously we said no because we didn't, they said that a group of 3 boys were seen scratching their car, bare in mind we were just a group of 4. We told them this but they insisted that we walked down the one way road to the house of the supposed witnesses. Luckily my mom brought me up to basically fear every stranger and to never trust anyone. I started walking away insisting that I don't like the situation, the guys in the car started panicking as my friends followed me to the top of the street where we could be seen by houses. I heard the driver who didn't get out the car shout to the others "Get back in quick". We thought nothing of it until a few years later were my cousin who was there brought it up, it gives me chills knowing if we trusted them, I wouldn't be here writing this.(Not an intense story but I thought I'd share)Thank you.

So i was like 4 years old, I didnt remember it but my mom tells stories about it all the time, I was playing outside, and a man outside the fence hopped the fence and grabbed me. My brothers saw it and started running but they couldnt catch him, they called 911 and we were already gone. My parents were crying in the family room when they called for our dog Daisy.. When she didnt come they checked the whole house for her, and eventually the police found a little kid being carried by my dog to the cul de sac we were in. Nobody ever knew what happened, considering i was 4. I still wondered how my dog saved me. Thank you Daisy. 2008-2018[Daisy](https://imgur.com/a/4LwSamj)

My (30M) employer covers registered massage therapy (RMT) and I only recently started using the allowance. I feel weirded out by another man massaging me so I only visit female therapists, and prefer good looking ones. In total, I�ve tried ~3 different places and RMT�s, and have gotten around 8-9 massages over the past year. often changing not because of the therapist but because of the time slots availability. Generally, I get a general relaxation massage as I don�t really have any issues so it involves work on the shoulders, back, and legs.Now when it comes to the legs, it�s hard to explain, but most therapists always adjust the covers such that only the lower legs and maybe a little bit above the knee are accessible and rest is covered completely from all sides so they can�t access anything higher as it�s all covered, including my bum and sides and everything. However, this one therapist I had a session with twice now, does things a little bit differently. Now remember she is also a registered massage therapist so no hanky panky!When working on the back, she takes the covers down further than any other therapist, to the point that I can almost feel my crack might be a tiny bit exposed (not sure, as I can�t actually see, but it feels like it). All other therapists always cover the bum and a little more, never go beyond it. When she massages, she also goes much further down and definitely has a couple of fingers that go further into the cover and maybe an inch or two onto my bum. It feels sooo good to be touched lightly like that.Later when I�m on my back and it�s time for the legs, the way she adjusts the sheet is a lot more exposing as well. All she does is, raise the sheet from one side to expose my entire leg and one side. So basically my entire side including my bum are exposed. No other therapist has done it this way before, they all pretty much follow a standard way so just the lower leg is exposed and nothing else at all. In her case however, she just bunches up the sheet down my center so the delicates are hidden, but not much else. When it comes to the massage, she also massages much much higher on the legs! Probably goes 3/4 of the way up the upper legs as well and her fingers pass so close to the jewels, it�s too much to handle!The first time I went I was so nervous I didn�t know what to do. The second time I was much more relaxed and I let whatever happens, happen. And what happened was as expected� I got a semi which must have made a tiny tent if nothing else, because the weight of the sheets was enough not to make a large impact. And it happened twice, because two legs haha.I�m going for my third session today, I�m sure nothing is actually going to happen because she is a registered therapist afterall, and she wouldn�t risk her license for anything. But I just wanted to share with you guys to see what you think of this!

Okay so let�s take it back to 2017 I was 20 I was having problems at home I honestly wanted to get my own place but I couldn�t didn�t have money or whatever I live in Miami Florida btw. Anyways I left home because I got in an argument with my mom the previous day I didn�t want to go back home.Anyways I�m wondering in this other county trying to think of what to do it�s night time so I going on reddit ask if anyone knows a place I can crash at in Miami. Someone gives me the name of this youth shelter in Miami. I call ask if their is any space they say yes and then I catch an Uber to Fort Lauderdale where it�s at it�s a 30 minute drive. The the other guy besides the driver I was driving with lived in Fort Lauderdale but came to the county I was in and I was like damn your going catch a 30 to 45 minute drive way where I�m at that�s expensive. My under drive was 20 dollars to Fort Lauderdale.Anyways I arrive at the shelter it�s pretty decent. I get interviewed then get food it was good and then they give me some spare clothes washing bathroom supplies and then send me to my room. Tbh I was planing on staying for a while at this place to see if I could possibly get an apartment but because of what happened I bailed.Okay so I get in the room there is like 5 guys there including me I bathe and then yeah then go to bed. The next morning there is like 4 black guys there one with red hair and then a white guy or might have been white hispanic. I�m mixed race half black half Latino I have been mistaken for Latino almost all my life.The next day the activities of the day go one I eat some food I see all the other young ppl my age there some homeless mothers and what not. I ended crying during lunch time. Anyways there was this really morbidly obese gay black guy probably like pushing 500 pounds tbh there and there was this black skinny guy with dreads. Well at night when I was in the room which had an awful stench of smelly old socks and something really fucking putrid to the point I couldn�t sleep when I arrived it fucking reeked it was way too smelly tbh to sleep in the room but everything else was okay. The black guy with the dreads was giving me an attitude the whole day for no reason I hadn�t even barely said a word to him.Anyways all day I was going attitude from certain  people and I wanna kick your ass stares and something about the place just didn�t seem right, anyways. He was going on about something about the bathroom that I didn�t know about cause I was new. Then the gay fat black guy told this other black guy in the room he disliked me and I didn�t even speak to him? So anyways after that I get up and walk out my room I call 911 and tell them to send an officer to this place to get me out out of fear of getting jumped they said they can�t do that??? How??? Idk tbh that was shocking I was in fear for my life! Anyways I just made up some lie saying I was suicidal and then they sent some cops to pick me up and then I said just take me to the hospital to be checked into the mental hospital when I got there they just left me at the door I decided not to check in and just caught an Uber back home. Lol it was a scary night.

Hey, Reddit. I've been having some downtime for myself and I just couldn't stop thinking about my dad. I wanted to get it out of my chest and thought "hey, why not here?"It's been about 7 years since he died, and I've been thinking about it recently. A lot actually.Every silent moment I have, I just inconscoiusly think about him; all the times we've had, all those time we just sat at the living room and chill, watching cartoons or whatever was on at the time. It was all I could ask for.There were times when he'd go out and drink, then he'd come home and fight with my mom. It was scary, and we'd hide in my grandma's room (it was her, me, and 2 of my brothers.) It was scary listening to them, and I'd even cry a bit because of them, but I knew better, that they were better than that.I wanted to ask him why he drank, and now I'll never know.Since then, death was a thing that I don't want to think about, ever. It was sad, terrifying even to think that one day, your loved ones will just die, and leave you alone in the world.If it wasn't for my mom, I would've sank into a state of depression, and I wouldn't be who I am today.She's a devout Christian through and through, and thanks to her, my understanding of death has lightened up.She told me that there is life after death, were all those who died, believing in Christ as their savior will go to heaven, and that they are waiting there for us, for the day that we'll be together again.I've been reflecting on that since that day 7 years ago, and now, I can find solace in those words, that I can see my father again in Heaven.Sorry for such a lengthy post, I just wanted to get that out of my chest.

I decided to start working out at a gym recently. I�ve always been an unfit and weak woman but I figured its about time to do something about it since I�m 30 years old. I live in a small town where there�s only one little gym, and as I got there I realized I knew a lot of the people in there. Well, I didn�t know them, but knew of them rather.Given that I�m a pretty nerdy bookworm kind of person with some social anxiety I felt completely out of place obviously. I tried my best to observe people and trying to recreate what they were doing as best as I could, but Istill had to accept the fact I could barely lift anything. If I had more self-confidence this wouldn�t have been a problem I guess, but as it was I really felt like a fish out of water.The final straw was when I tried doing some curles with dumbbells (it seemed easy enough) and happened to end up next to a 12 year old boy (I know him from my daugthers school and he�s also the owners son). So there I was, struggling with my pathetic little dumbbells while he was using much heavier ones like there was no tomorrow. When he was done he smugly asked me if I wanted his weights, to which I responed by awkwardly laughing and saying �No thanks� and headed for the shower.Last time I went to the gym? Did anyone else feel like this and maybe have some advice on how to get more confidence going back?TL,DR: I went to the gym for the first time and felt completely out of place and humiliated. Any advice on building confidence?

This is an experience I had about 8 years ago, but it recently popped back into my head. For clarification, I'm 16 and at the time of this happening I was in 2nd grade. I had just skipped a grade so naturally I didn't have any friends in this class since I had just joined it. After days of sitting alone in the corner of the classroom some kid finally approached me(lets call him Tim) So Tim was a little bit of a weird kid, he'd always shout random things in the middle of class, play by himself at lunch, and the one thing I remember most was that he would talk to himself. This is where it starts to get weird.So me and Tim would always hang out together at lunch and during class if we got the chance, but I also started to get to know other kids a little bit. One day at lunch instead of hanging out with Tim, I went and hung out with another kid(Ryan). Tim did not take this well at all. He eventually found me at lunch playing with Ryan and he grabbed my arm really hard. This wasn't your typical playful fighting type grab. He was malicious in his intentions and had hatred in his eyes. He wanted to hurt me. He pulled my across the playground to where we usually played and said if I ever hung out with someone else instead of him he'd kill me. I watched a lot of TV and I always heard people say this, so I didn't think much of it. Fast forward a couple of months later and I ask Tim if he wants to play hide and seek with me and Ryan and Tim says yes to my surprise. So at lunch we're playing and Tim is the seeker and me and Ryan are hiding. I'm hiding behind a small bulge in the ground where I can see Tim but he can't see me. All of a sudden he just appears out of nowhere, I didn't see him coming or anything. I get up and start to back up and see if he's going to chase me or anything. Then I see he had something in his hands. It was rocks. He had about 10 rocks in his hands and he threw all of them at me one right after the other, again with that same malice and hatred I saw when he grabbed my arm months prior. What really made me mad is when he threw the last few rocks one hit me directly between the eyes. He was mere inches away from taking out half of my vision. Luckily I didn't have anger issues back then, so I didn't hit him or anything, I just told one of the teachers stationed outside what happened and (this being a private school) Tim was expelled. Looking back my parents always taught me to never judge anyone and be nice to everyone, so this is why I started to be friends with Tim even though he was a little weird and never seemed to have any other friends. I learned from this experience that being nice to a certain extent is good but if you're overly nice it might not benefit you in the end. I consider myself lucky to only be taking away a valuable lesson from this experience.

When I was about 10 (I'm 38 now) me, my brothers (aged 9 & 11) and our friends about 5/6 of them all about our ages, all used to hang around by a row of shops, loads of kids used to hang around there but they were all a lot older than us (probably about 16 - mid 20's) They didn't seem to mind us being there with them.  The main reason we went there was because one of the shops had a Street Fighter 2 arcade machine in it (which was an awesome game!!) The older kids were all pretty rough guys, most people knew and tried to avoid them as much as they could, we felt kind of cool having these 'tough' older lads letting us hang around with them. Their was the odd fight there now and again, but I can't remember noticing them doing much that seemed that bad (apart from what I'm about to tell you about) although thinking back I've got a suspicion that they were doing a lot more than what we knew.  One time me and my pals were in the newsagent buying sweets, when one of the older lads came in, we started hearing a raised voice then when we looked the kid had the shopkeeper against the wall with a knife to him.  He proceeded to rob the till, cigarettes etc.  He then looked at us and told us to take whatever we wanted, being so young and not fully understanding the full seriousness of the situation we each grabbed a few packets of sweets each, then us and the guy doing the actual robbery just walked out of the shop.  Just to show how little we understood what had just happened we went from that shop straight into the shop that had the Street Fighter 2 game in it which was only about 2/3 shops down, and apart from being excited about now having a load of sweets we didn't really think much at all about what we were just involved in. We stayed for about 5-10 minutes playing the game and then jumped on our bikes and rode home, nothing ever came of it

I was in drivers ed class and we were talking about drugs and alcohol, I wasn�t too worried about being drunk or high behind the wheel because I have a heart condition called long QT syndrome and if I get anything more that a slight buzz or do any illegal drug, that�s it, I die. So anyway, we took a 5 minute break since the class is 2 hours long, I�m talking to some friends and we do a lap around a small part of the school (drivers ed is from 6pm to 8pm in the high school) so I�m talking about how I�m the eternal designated driver and then as we walk into the classroom I say �I am one line of cocaine away from going into cardiac arrest� since the loudest people were getting snacks from the vending machine, roughly half the class heard me say that. That didn�t sound good since without context it sounds like I have done coke before and if I did it again I would die so then I tried to make a sort of recovery by adding comments about having a heart condition to add context and make it not seem as bad and then i sit down and the teacher says �could you please refrain from making jokes about drugs and dying, from a personal and professional standpoint, I find it offensive and then I just shut up and got embarrassed and for the rest of class my friend (who sits in the row ahead of me since the accounting classroom looks like a miniature college lecture hall) kept turning around and either sniff his finger, pretend to smoke a joint or drink alcohol and then fake a heart attack

Worst diarrhea in my life. Some 7.5 months ago, just as I was about to submit my final subject assignment to pass and graduate high school, I started feeling immense pain in my stomach. I called my mom to pick me up so I could shit in peace at home, I ended up sharting in my pants and wrapping my hoodie around my stomach and ass to hide what I imagine was a very unpleasant-looking stain and I was standing outside holding it in like never before despite the growing pain from the pressure with the might of 200 Philistine foreskins. If you've experienced something similar, then you know you have periods of pain and periods of relief, before they interchange. When she came, I boarded the car and eventually completely let it go; now, what you're about to read is the raw, un-exaggerated truth. The liquid shit filled my underpants to the full; it leaked to my pants down to my knees. It smelled so fucking bad you'd swear a rotting carcass of 30 skunks that is somehow also acidic is being turned into pulp next to your nose. And the amount of it was un-fucking believable.&#x200B;By the time I got home and jumped on the toilet, I released even more. When I pulled down my pants, there was so much shit in those underpants and pants they were rendered completely unusable and thrown away. Shit covering my skin from top to bottom with so much shit it changed its complexion - unbelievable amounts of liquid shit that smelled so bad I went into puking mode 7 times until I washed away some amounts and it got manageable. I have never in my life even seen so much fucking shit until that point. Showering caused the whole thing to seep down and turned the water to India river hue. The reason this happened in the first place is my grandma's cooking that I had had earlier in the day, a vegetable-based meal and she's a TERRIBLE dish washer, leaving previous rotten food on there, way past date ingredients and likely tons of detergent used when cleaning. This caused me the worst diarrhea in existence and I sincerely hope no one else has to go through it.&#x200B;To compliment this instance, some months ago I found a blackhead worm in the worm-shaped pasta she made, I was actually specifically checking for that and it took me 2 seconds to find it, in a bowl of pasta that looked like a bunch of worms which is why I was careful. Fuck, who knows who much fucked up shit I ate younger without knowing. She often cooks me meals, but I make sure to throw them all away not wanting to risk another shitpocalypse with good merit. I also happened to have bitten into a centipede at her place when I was younger and I thereby now share the useless fact it tastes like you'd imagine battery acid tastes like; it was on my coke glass in a dim room. Worth noting I didn't submit my final assignment without going home. Luckily, it was picked up as I left it on the professor's desk.&#x200B;There, it's finally out. (No pun intended)

So I was under 7 years old. I used to be in a rich private school and they took us on excursions to nice places, like planetariums, zoo's, aquariums and such. I liked going to the aquariam because it was a thing that happened often. One time in a dream of mine my mom and dad take me to an aquariam, we then enter some maintenance area covered in white tiles.It's very empty for a maintenance room, and just then I see some divers in full gear and rebreathers, wielding pole weapons trying to shove some tentacles into a shower, each tentacle has fleshy, peach hammers on the end of it. I see the squid, I feel horrified and I blink once. When I open my eyes I am inside it's shower, it makes a horrible shrill and lunges it's tentacles toward my eyes, it then beats me to death and I die.

It was December and I decided to walk around the small 4000 people populated city that I live in with a close friend. He has a lighter with him even though we didn't use to smoke at that time. It was around 11pm at night and a fucked up yet silly idea came to my mind. There was a big old trash can with a lot of garbage in it next to the local post of the city, which was located close to the city centre and I decided to see if the garbage would light up if I just use the lighter for 5 seconds. I saw that nothing big really happened and continued to walk around with my friend. About half an hour later, we had stopped to sit on a bench about half a kilometer away from the local post and we saw smoke in the air, in the direction where the post was. I didn't think at that time that it could've been the trash can producing that smoke because when I tried to light the garbage on fire it didn't work. But me and my friend who are the crazy types of guys that we are and always like to joke and say funny stuff told each other that the smoke was from the garbage. Nevertheless we dediced to go and check the place. When we reached there there wasn't any flames but smoke was fuming away from the trash can. Oh shit, we really did it I said and because we are the guys that we are, we laughed hysterically and walked away like nothing happened. About 20 minutes later we once again wanted to go check the place. Oh my, the trash can was covered by 8 feet tall flames. Inside, we were laughing but of course we could not let the fire get any bigger because in the city that we live, there is not even a police department, hence a fire department. The closest fire department was like an hour drive away. Luckily, the house next to the trash can had a water hose available for us to use and so did we. We were "battling with fire" for about 10 minutes before the fire was put out. The cars that were passing by stopped to see what the heck had happened and even praised us for being "nice citizens" and "saviors" too. If only they knew! *EVIL LAUGH*In the end it was ironic that the same people who lit a fire also extinguished it. We are not evil people and didn't think that it would light up but we redeemed ourselves in the end by putting the dangerous, who knows what would've happened if it wasn't extinguished fire, out!



******************************



When I was thirteen years old, my parents got divorced. I didn�t learn that this was happening until my dad had half of his life packed into cardboard boxes in the back of a Ford Orion. Next thing I knew, he was gone, and my mother just sat and hugged me as I cried until I gave myself a nosebleed.From that day on, my relationship with my parents was defined by competition. Their pretence that both their worlds still revolved around me went out the window after Dad�s first visit, two months later. I pounced on him the moment he got out of his car and I cried myself raw all over again. He just gripped me tightly and let me get it out. I remember looking back at Mum and the way she made eye contact with me. I didn�t understand the look on her face at the time, but I now understand what it was � disgust. Betrayal. She shook her head and went inside.Dad let me sit in the car for a while and it smelt like I always remembered. Cigarette smoke, his aftershave, and that musty odour that old car upholstery used to get over time. I wanted to freeze time in that car and never leave.�Let�s go somewhere,� I said to him, only half joking.He glanced at the house and for a second, I think he was tempted. A wicked, hungry grin spread across his face. He shook his head and it was gone. �Maybe some other time.�They talked for a long, long time. At first it was the three of us, I was asking Dad so many questions that he could barely answer me. Once my questions had ran out, Mum asked me why I don�t go and play for a while. You know the kind � the non-negotiable order disguised as a question. I didn�t want to go to my room when I hadn�t seen my dad in two months, but he gently offered his support of the idea and so I relented. They shut the kitchen door behind me.Soon enough, their conversation got louder. I couldn�t hear much from the top of the stairs, but I caught snippets. Something about Dad�s �safety�, what Mum �went through�, and about him �being the same man�. He seemed offended by what she was saying, and my heart jumped when the kitchen door flew open and he stormed down the hallway.�You�re not going to say goodbye to your son?� she said derisively.�Jason, I�m going,� he called behind him, almost in a bored manner.By the time I got to the bottom of the stairs, he�d already slammed the door behind him. I just stared at it, the empty space where he has just been, and started crying again. Mum made a disgusted noise from the back of her throat and shut herself in the kitchen. I felt hollow. Unwanted. I remember clutching my pillow in my room, screaming and wishing I could be unborn. I got another nosebleed.Things changed from then on. Visits were shorter, and they were quickly replaced with phone conversations instead. The conversations were always heavily monitored, and never about me. They became proxy wars for my parents to wage through me. Mum would listen from the next room and swoop in if there were any questions she judged to be prying. Looking back, sometimes she was right. Dad would occasionally ask something like if there were any other men who had visited or slept over, or he would ask if I had enough food or clothing. The phone would be torn from my grip and I would sit and listen to a one-sided argument echo through the empty rooms of our broken home. Afterwards I�d be told not to answer his stupid questions, and she�d give me that look. Disgust. Betrayal.Mum started dating about a year later, and for a while she seemed like her old self. She was happier, she had time for me. She�d turn the television down to listen to me speak, instead of shushing me. She talked to me about her new boyfriend and I was encouraging. I cried in private so she wouldn�t know I didn�t want anybody new. I spoke to Dad about it on one of our phone conversations, and when she didn�t talk to me for days, I knew he�d brought it up with her. He laughed about it in our next conversation.�Arrogant bitch,� he growled. �She�s like that, you know. Shameless bitch just turns on you the second you displease her.�I didn�t say anything, just listened. I felt like I was crossing a boundary just hearing him speak like this. He sighed, sounding deflated, and then made a lively sound as if he was in good spirits all of a sudden. �So, how�s school, champ? Do anything fun today?�Mum�s dates got more frequent, and soon they would last all night. I learned to cope, but the emptiness was haunting. The armchair where Dad used to sit and read was a loud reminder of the void in my life. Its arms were pockmarked with cigarette burns and it smelt like him, even months after he was gone. I would curl up and fall asleep with the TV playing boring shows I didn�t understand, just to fill the silence.One morning, Mum came home with a man I didn�t recognise. They stumbled through the door hugging and kissing, and she laughed like she was imitating a girl half her age. I hated it, it was so creepy to me. My eyes filled with tears as I watched them kiss, and I couldn�t contain a hiccupping sob. They looked at me and Mum shook her head, making that disgusted throat noise that I despised.�That�s him,� she said flatly. �Crying on cue.�The man smiled. �I�ll toughen him up. That�s what a real dad should do, at least.�She laughed and kissed him again. I turned and marched upstairs, my face red with shame and anger. I didn�t know what to do, and in my helplessness I could only think to phone Dad. I told him everything and how I hated all the changes, how I missed him. He just listened, but didn�t sound helpful. A few times he sighed like he�d rather be doing something else. I ended the call feeling just as empty.To my surprise he came to the house later that afternoon, and he banged on the door so hard I thought he was going to break it clean off his hinges. I�d never heard him shout like that before. He was like a man possessed, pure animalistic rage that made him bellow and slam things. There were threats, something smashed, and the police were even called. There was a lot of talking, Mum cried, even Dad cried once he calmed down. Hours later he left, and I left with him.I got into the passenger seat of his car amidst an audience of twitching curtains and I clutched a box of my things in my lap. I glanced at the house one last time as we pulled away. Mum wasn�t looking at me with disgust or betrayal. She wasn�t there at all. The door had already been closed, a man whose name I didn�t even know closing the kitchen curtains of his warm new home. I was cold and empty in a time capsule of cigarette smoke and aftershave.The first night was hard, and I couldn�t sleep. The reality, I think, had begun to set in, and I made my new pillowcase splotchy with tears. Dad overheard and he came to sit on my bed and soothe me. He was kind and gentle now, all of his anger from earlier like a completely different person. It took a while, but I eventually calmed down.�Can I still visit Mum?� I asked him, my voice hoarse from the strangling tightness in my throat.�Of course,� he said. He hugged me, tousled my hair, and left me to sleep. The silence without Mum�s voice to see me off to sleep was deafening.The next day I got up for school like normal, but Dad was still in bed. I tried a few doors, finding a closet, the bathroom, and eventually his bedroom. The smell in his room was strong, stronger than the car, stronger than anything I had ever smelt in my young life thus far. There was the cigarettes and the aftershave, but something else mingled with the atmosphere, something wretched and unpleasant. It reminded me of old clothes from the attic, stale and caustic, like dust and rot.�Dad,� I whispered. No response. �Dad,� I tried a little louder, and this time he stirred.�What?��Should I be getting ready for school?�He groaned and rolled over. �No. Go back to bed.�His voice was flat and irritated. It didn�t sound like him at all. I withdrew silently and did as I was told, nursing my hurt feelings. He was just tired. Maybe he went to bed late. I probably was being annoying. I drifted back to sleep.When I woke up later, there was a stranger sat with Dad in the living room. They were joking and laughing together and watching some show about cars on the TV. The room was acrid with smoke, and with no open windows it formed a thick haze that undulated through the air. I coughed involuntarily and they turned to look at me. The stranger was startled.�Shit, Mike, I didn�t know you had a kid,� he said, grinning stupidly at me.I was confused. My father was called Steven, not Mike.Dad clicked his teeth. �Yep, he�s my problem now, aren�t you boy?� He laughed, but not kindly. It was at my expense.The stranger stayed for hours, only leaving the apartment to go and buy more cigarettes. Eventually, as night crept in, he left. �See ya, kid,� he shouted, and slammed the door behind him. I didn�t like him, but unfortunately it was only the first time of many that I would see him. I learned his name was Greg, and he had a daughter that he never visited.The next day, Dad was a completely different person. Or rather, he was the right person. The person I had always known. He was cooking breakfast for us when I woke up, and he bid me good morning with a smile and a hug. We watched cartoons while we ate. He drove me to the park, and he listened to me as I talked. He was my Dad.He stayed like this for another day, and after that he became his strange, cold alter ego once more. I would avoid him as much as possible when he was in that mood, and he didn�t seem to care. I began to write down who he was each day to see if I could discern a pattern. There wasn�t one. It could be a daily switch, or one of them could stay for a few days. Sometimes, very rarely, they might even swap during the day. Steven was my father, as I�d always known him. Warm, dependable, and friendly. Mike was a mean, venomous man living in my father�s skin.I didn�t go to school anymore. Mike didn�t care enough to buy me a uniform or backpack, plus he figured I was �old enough that I knew enough�. Steven, on the other hand, would wave away the subject any time it came up, immediately supplanting it with something fun. It was irresponsible, I know that now � but I just couldn�t say no. I also know now that Steven was scared, and he wanted to spend every second he had with me. He couldn�t bare to let me go, and I suppose the feeling was mutual.The strangest thing about it all was the way that different people would come and ask after a specific side. Greg, the weird guy who put me on edge and seemed to weigh up a person�s worth with beady, searching eyes, would never come to visit Steven. He only turned up for Mike, and when he did, that was who he got. Mike didn�t care much for me, he took little to no care of his apartment, and he smoked religiously.Steven was my real father. He cared about me, he�d let me help him as he tidied up after his other self, and he was always ready for a game or some quality time. I slowly came to accept this strange dichotomy that was my dad, equal parts loving and hateful. I was never abused, at least not physically, but my life was empty in so many ways. I didn�t know it at the time, but I basically lived for the breaks in the clouds when I got my real father.One night, I got up from the sofa to make a drink. We�d been watching a movie, and I paused it to quickly go to the kitchen. When I sat back down, Dad was smoking a cigarette. I hesitated as I noticed, and he laughed. It was the unkind laugh.�Something wrong, son?� he asked with false nonchalance.I remember how angry I suddenly felt, that he�d interrupted and ruined an evening that I was enjoying with the generous side of my father�s schism.�What�s your problem?� I demanded. �Why can�t you stay out of our life?�He just took a long, deliberate drag on his cigarette and peered at me like he was trying to figure me out. �How exactly do I stay out of our life? It�s mine too. Clue�s in the wording.��You�re not Steven. You�re not my dad.�He snorted. �Course I am. I�m Steven, Steven is me.� He grinned widely and flashed his teeth. �And you�re me, too.�Fingers of ice wrapped around my gut, but I stayed defiant. �So what?�His grin evaporated. �The sins of the fathers shall be visited upon the sons.�I was silent for what felt like a long time. Mike just watched me, inhaling deep lungfuls of smoke. There was no softness in his face, not a shred of empathy.�Grandad was the same?� I asked.Mike unbuttoned a sleeve and rolled it up to the elbow. His exposed forearm was mottled with scars and puckered flesh. �Worse. Much worse.� He turned to cover a hacking cough. �Be grateful, you little shit.��Grateful?� Now it was my turn to laugh. �For you?��You used to cry all the damn time. I�ve toughened you up. That�s what a real dad should do.�I stood up to leave the room. As I got to the door I stopped and decided to hazard one last question. �Don�t you love me at all?�He froze, the smouldering stub of his cigarette hovering halfway to his lips. I was surprised at how I had managed to knock him off balance, even if only for a moment. His eyes betrayed nothing, but I knew the cogs were turning in his head.He growled. �I loved and trusted and I got nothing in the end. It�s not my job anymore.�Over the next few years, Dad�s health slowly deteriorated, but looking back it feels like I got no time with him at all. It was another subject I couldn�t bring up, no matter what side I got. Mike would evade questions and tell me to piss off. Steven would act like everything was fine and feign deafness to the whole thing.Eventually, on a cold white morning in October, the day came when an exceptional silence had settled over the unloved, detritus-ridden apartment of my father. I checked the time. 11AM. Either one of them would have been up long before now.I opened the door to my father�s room. The sticky hinges made staccato snapping sounds like bones breaking in cold, crisp air. My father lay on his back, facing away from the door, unmoving and unbreathing. I realised then that the foul, stale smell that usually haunted his room was gone. Just cigarettes and aftershave. His covers were pulled up under his armpits and he was laid neatly, his pillow gently propping up his head. All I could do was stand and look at his body, and I began to cry. I cried so hard, for all the years and all the wasted time I had to watch him be someone he wasn�t. I gave myself a nosebleed.I didn�t want the apartment, but I didn�t want anybody else to have it either. When it was cleaned up, I�ll admit that it actually wasn�t too bad. It had everything I would need, and from the way my calls to Mum had been ignored for the past two years, I wasn�t going anywhere else any time soon. I had to text her to give her the news. She never replied.Why have I gone through the trouble of recounting all this? Some sympathy wouldn�t go amiss, but that isn�t the reason.A stranger came for me yesterday. When I answered the door, he grinned at me.�Good to see you, Mike.�

I find this extremely hilarious and I don�t know any other place this fits. This actually isn�t my story, it�s my brothers. He is working as a nurse in a nearby hospital. So basically this guy runs in holding his crotch and screaming in pain. So they ask him the standard, �What happened?� and �How did this happen?� And he explains that he was in the kitchen with his girlfriend. They were having fun and I don�t know how, but he thought he was in and thrusted. He hit it against the tile and it just broke. In the hospital they did an exam and in the end he will never have an erection again. Thought that was amusing.

So, this just happened, and... well, I think it's entertaining enough.I guess this is my obligatory 'sorry for the formatting, on mobile' here? So, I'm shopping at this store, right? And this store has automatic doors. So I go in, and I'm looking to score some marshmallows, because it's a phase, right?I go in and start looking, when someone taps on my shoulder. This lady, who looks like she's in her mid-fifties, is standing there. We'll call her Karen, because this is Reddit. So, this is what happened...  Me: "Uh, hello ma'am. Can I help you?" Karen: "wHy DiDn'T yOu hOld oPen tHe DoOr?!"I'm completely taken aback by this. Oh, don't forget, the store has AUTOMATIC DOORS.Me: "I'm sorry, ma'am, but those were automatic doors."Karen: "exCUSE ME?! DON'T TALK BACK TO YOUR ELDERS!" So then I just stand there, DUMBFOUNDED by this lady yelling at me and ranting to me about 'kids these days' and how they 'have no respect for elders'.A few minutes later, I'm just kinda sick of her, so I just leave and go find my marshmallows, and I guess... that's my story!

Okay so about 5 years ago (I'm 17 now, so I was around 12) I lived in an apartment complex that had a sand volleyball court towards the back, which all the kids had called "the Sand Pit."So it was a regular day, and all the kids (including me) played outside practically every day. We weren't in the best of areas so it was pretty normal to see a couple cop cars just roaming around the complex. That day though there was a little more than usual, but still we didn't really think anything of it. We were all outside at the sand pit playing dodgeball, and there were probably about 20-25 kids around. As we're playing this guy slowly starts walking across the street towards us, looking very suspicious. Once he gets about 30 feet away you can see him putting his hands behind his back, about to grab something. As soon as he does, two cops walk up from behind him and tased him, causing him to drop to the ground. Once he falls two guns fall out of his hands to the side of him, and the cops kicked them away and arrested him. The group of kids all ran, (including me) and all had a story to tell. I'm sure that, if the cops weren't there, most of us wouldn't be here right now.

My 12 year old has hit that age where he�s not about the small talk anymore. Just wants to be cool, listen to his own music, and generally be left the eff alone. No problem at all, I�ve been preparing for this. He forgot that I remember his one weakness:  Whitney Houston.  You see when he was around 6 or 7 years old somehow he became obsessed with her single �I Have Nothing.�  So I just hit play, turned up the volume, and like clockwork the earbuds came out...he started belting away from the bottom of his soul.  �Doooon�t maaaake meeee...CLOOOSE one more door, I don�t wanna huuurt anymore...�  Voice just like an like an angel from heaven.  �Stay in my liiiiiiife if you dare...or must I imaaaagine you there... �  All the emotions that were trapped deep inside came out today.

Thought I would share some stories my grandfather told me about throughout my upbringing.   If you have interesting stories to share that were passed down by family please share!  ; Back in the 70s/80/90s my grandfather was a train station manager across a number of different train stations around Sydney, Australia.    During one shift a small fellow walked up to my grandfather and without saying a word pulled out a large knife in attempt to rob him.   My grandfather grabbed the hand with the knife and punched the robber with a closed fist knocking him down. The kid managed to jump up after a few moments and run away. Sydney back then & today for some parts was pretty rough so this type of robbery was not uncommon.    Around this time was the shocking news of **Janine Kerrie Balding**�who was a savagely kidnapped raped and murdered by a gang of five (four youths and an adult). Turns out that the adult that attempted to rob the train station was Stephen "Shorty" Jamieson who was the same guy who murdered Janine Balding. He is now serving a life sentence. To obtain a life sentence in Australia means you have done something to the most extreme and have no possibility of rehabilitation.   It brings me great pleasure thinking about my grandfather who himself was very small in stature knocking out an evil murderer. ���������   Back in those days the station manager was permitted a .45 revolver firearm to move the days takings around. One day my grandfather being young and silly decided to play with the revolver by himself in one of the back rooms. He emptied the rounds from the firearm would spin the mag(?) throw it back into place like the movies and pull the trigger.   While he was doing this he must have left a bullet in the mag. He spun the mag flipped the mag back into place aimed at the metal cash box and pulled the trigger. An almighty BOOM went off and being an underground station the noise must have traveled half way around Sydney CBD!The bullet hit the tin box bounced off went past his head with only inches to spare and embedded itself in the wall.   After that day he swore to himself not to play with the gun and had a much better understanding on gun safety!    ���������Not that interesting of a story to read but to hear an old man tell its something I will remember all my life. My grandfather was born in 1928 and as you can imagine it was a much different time back then.  He and a few of his friends were at the milk bar where this older kid use to hang out. This kid use to try and pick on and fight my grandfather whenever he could. My grandfather was not interested in fighting this kid but the kid persisted day in day out. One day my grandfather had enough and told the kid if you want to fight lets go out to the back alley.    Once in the alley this larger kid started laying into my grandfather for a good 15 minutes while my grandfather just blocked everything he could as much as he could. Never throwing a punch. After 15 minutes or so the kid dropped his hands exhausted and said �I�m finished� to which my grandfather replied �Well I am just getting started� and proceeded to give this kid a beating of a life time. That kid never did try bully or fight my grandfather from that day.��������-   My grandfather somehow always seem to be in the wrong place at the wrong time..or right time depending how you want to look at it. One day he went down to our local shops and as he was walking past the TAB (Betting agent store) he noticed a man walking towards him with a gun covered in a towel while wearing a balaclava.Both the robber and my Grandfather got to the door of the TAB at the same time so my grandfather for whatever reason grabbed the barrel of the firearm and the man and pushed him away from the door, entered the TAB & shut and locked the door behind him. The robber stood there for a few moments trying to think about what happened and thankfully deciding against firing shots left the scene. From what my grandfather can recall the robber was arrested not long after for other robberies where shots were fired.    This robbery affected my grandfather a lot more than we thought later on. He witnessed countless suicides and accidental deaths on the rail way however that man with the gun was the thing that haunted him the most.   Unfortunately my grandfather passed away many years later due to asbestosis which he picked up from working on the rail way.   \_\_\_\_If you are interested in more stories I will see what my mother has to remember and post them at a later date.

Let me tell you a tale of emotion, love, torture, and kinda nothing I just mentioned, except, uh... all of it... in a way. Anyway, I�m on my last day of a weekend choir trip in New York. Me and the boys spent a lot of time with a group of girls from our school. I�m kinda into one of the girls and, well, here�s something I should explanate: when I�m around a girl I like, sometimes I get nervous and get sick to my stomach. Anyway, the whole day, we were having fun, I was making the girl I like laugh by being the idiot I pride myself as. Me and her have a similarly stupid, decently meme-based sense of humor. But remember how I was saying my stomach starts to hurt when I�m with girls I like? Well I was with this girl almost the whole day, so you can imagine I was a damn mess at dinner. I barely wanted to eat. It�s entirely possible the only reason I did eat anything was because I had Penne Vodka. I went to the bathroom three times just in that meal. At one point, idk how this came up, but the girl said she was in a relationship. Now you may think I was like �Well gosh darn, that sucks, but now I don�t have to worry about liking her anymore, everything�s great!� But oh no, you probably didn�t think that at all. But if you did, oh god no, I felt like I�d been shot in the heart and the stomach at the same time. I ended up puking my guts out (in a toilet. You fucking idiot). I also apparently had a minor fever. I took two tylenols and a pill that I can�t remember what it was called and everyone was really sympathetic to me. I ended up fine tho and I still went to see Madama Butterfly with everyone afterwords. So everything turned out fine, except I didn�t get the girl. How would I? She has a boyfriend and doesn�t know I like her? So do I tell her tonight? Yeah I think that�s what I�ll do. Wish me luck boys.

Me, Jackson, Mabry, Noah, Zach, Baby A, Benson, Coop, Cambree, Rex, Cadence, Gracie, and Ben go into the water with the waves being 7 to 8 feet high. Benson Atkins being 6�2 then says �I can not touch guys, we need to go back.� It was then and there we realized we were about to die. Baby A then grabs Benson and says �I am panicking, I can�t swim.� Josue grabs ahold to coop because he starts drowning, Cooper then grabs Mabry and Gracie because the waves keeps taking them under. Ben then grabs Jackson because he is literally drowning but then Ben let�s go of Jackson because he thought he was stable. Me, Rex, Cadence, and Cambree start to swim back because the waves kept taking us under. Us four finally make it back and I�m looking out onto the ocean and see everyone else except Jackson. I then say �Where�s Jackson?� Right after I say that Jackson comes up from under a wave and then another wave grabs him and he immediately goes back under. Ben then hurry�s and swims to Jackson because he notices that he is drowning. He grabs him by the arm and yanks him out of the water that�s when I finally noticed that Jackson was drowning because he had pure terror on his face. Ben then practically drags Jackson onto shore and then everyone else�s starts coming back gasping for air. We all inhaled 2 gallons of water and almost died on September 14, 2019.

It was several years ago. I was a senior in High School and all my friends had just got GTA V. I was so jealous hearing about all the cool shit you could do. At the end of that week, I got my paycheck from work and went over to the K-Mart near me to buy the game. As I was about to walk out the door this man stopped me. He asked what I had purchased and after finding out it was GTA V, he started to shame me and said that God is going to be disappointed in my choices. He went on and on about how these games are �corrupting� the youth of the younger generation, and if I play this game I too would be corrupted and resort to violence. He told me to look up some Bible verse, and told me to come to his church to relieve myself of my sins. I appeased the man by telling him sure thing, �I�ll return it tomorrow�. I went home, slapped that bad puppy in and tore shit up. I played that game non-stop for a week. I shot up cars, drove people over, even spent $100s of dollars on hookers. It�s now 2019. Haven�t become more violent. I�ve never thought about shooting people, and I�ve never stepped into a stripclub. So Trump, shut the fuck up about video games and focus on mental health and gun reform. God damn orange asshole.

She started puking after every meal she ate using the excuse that she needed to use the bathroom when out....See it was society who led her to this and then critisized her after she start doing it.All she wanted was to be a little bit skinnier.She wanted to eat what she wanted and stay the size she was.She didnt see that she was beautiful weather she was big or small.She didnt realize that with or without make up she looked stunning.She couldnt see the natural beauty that she had.Society cut her down and called her fat and ugly...Then there was a bully at school.They would slam her against the locker and hit her...They hated her...She was always so happy until society took that person from her because according to society you have to be....5'4.Skin and bones.You have to wear make up.And You have to be on top of the latest fashion trends.This is how you go unnoticed.But because she was noticed she was torn from limb to limb.Torn apart piece by piece.She would come home with bruises and have to cover them up with make up every morning so her parents wouldnt ask.Then a guy came along. He made her feel different.She felt beautiful.She felt like her life was worth living.He made her feel like she could do anything so she fought to get her life back...The girl in this story is the girl here writing.If you are reading/listening to this remember you are stronger than you believe you may want to give up but dont. Remember that once you hit rock bottom the only way to go is up. Fight to get your life back and never give up its your life and your in control so show them that your stronger than them. Look in the mirror every morning and look at how beautiful you are without make up. Look how strong you are you are strong enought that your still here today so please keep fighting. Find someone who loves you for you and dont let anyone take that person away.

So I'm 15, just out of Freshman year and man did that suck! First semester was meh, second was bad, summer has been AWFUL. In January I met this girl, she was great! Everything about her was amazing except her relationship status. She wasn't single so I just moved on. Come feburary, her and her bf have a huge fight and break up, naturally I swoop in and help. Eventually I ask her out and she says yes. February passes, great! March passes, great, some issues. April comes, not so good. Then comes May.Two weeks go by in May, nothing terrible. Then my friends invite me to a party. Most of my friends are girls, it's just who I like to hang out with. Understandably she was worried about whether or not I'd be faithful (spoiler: I was. I still have been but more later). I assure her she's got nothing to worry about but still she's messaging me all during the party. Eventually I tell her she's overreacting and then she loses it. We get in a huge fight that ends with her basically forcing me to choose between her and my best friend. I manage to avoid it until the next morning. The next day, not 2 hours after I woke up, she's already forcing me to choose. I snap, I start talking about killing myself and honestly planning. That makes her forget about our arguement but now I have to deal with the repercussions of my actions. Twice a week therapy, yay! From there it's all down hill. She was already depressed but now she's losing it. It all culminates on the last day of school, 30 minutes into summer break, she knocks back 100 benadryl. Luckily she calls me and my mom gets an ambulance to her house in time to save her.At this point her mom basically blames me for everything and I know I won't be able to see her for the whole summer. I was okay with this and wholly prepared to wait for her until the other side. Apparently I was the only one. Over the course of the summer I ask her mom how she's doing and get nowhere multiple times. Naturally I ask some of her friends but that doesn't work either. At this point I'm not too composed (by which I mean getting a little creepy, I'll admit). That gets me to yesterday when I find out she's been playing me since June 14th. Apparently she is worried I'm going to kidnap her! For clarification I am 15, dont have my permit, dont know where she lives, dont know her schedule, dont have any way of forcing her to come, nothing. Now today my dad tells me that her mom is looking to get me expelled from my school!Anyway, I'll update if something else happens with some kind of cinematic quality, thanks for listening!Update: For clarification, I only dislike her mom for one reason: She has repeatedly lied to me about how she's doing and how she feels in an attempt to get rid of me. She went so far as to fake a letter and voicemail to try to make me dislike her daughter.Update: Now she's talking shit about me to my friends. And I guess they have filed for a restraining order.-J

I got two cockatiels almost two weeks ago. Our meeting was miraculous.So, my boyfriend and I discussed getting a new type of birds, because our budgies seemed... Lonely(?) in their cage. And in January, we finally read enough about cockatiels to say: We are ready.Thus, we renovated the bird cage a bit more. New branches, a few plastic leaves (we later removed them, because the breeder warned us to not have any plastic.)When we were done, we drove to the breeder, where we got our first budgies. But outside the shop was a flyer, saying that they are aboit to close. There was no date, just a phone number. And the door was closed.My boyfriend and I considered, what we will do now. And luckily, the owner saw us and let us in! The whole shop was empty now. A few dog beds, empty tanks, hamster cages. But no more fish and we heard no birds. I was prepared to be disappointed.But when we told her what we are searching for, she lit up and led us to the backroom (where hamsters, budgies, chinchillas, etc. used to be) and the world was united. Two pairs of cockatiels. One belonged to her, but the other pair.I cannot describe the feeling. In the whole shop, on maybe its last day open, there were exactly one type of animal left. The type, that my boyfriend and I researched and wanted. It was... just like fate wanted to connect us.So, she told us a few things about the birdies, which we later brought home. Immediately, we forgot who was the male and female. But be unbothered.Now, we had a chair outside the cage and watched them silently and named then Christie and Fyodor (after two authours, that I admire. At first I wanted to name them melodic names because: they are singing birds.)As time passed, we went into the cage to feed our budgies and clean a bit and just watch them. I soon brought home sunflower seeds from work, because they are crazy for that. I always say a certain word for each seed I place in front of them.The other day, I turned up music and one began dancing, until she noticed me watching. Fyodor begins shaking his head with me, if I do it long enough too.And the other day, bless, I turned up cockatiel videos. Just a few compilations. Fyodor and Christie reacted positively, especially when a Star Wars melody played. They loved it. I turned the videos up more often.I wanted to teach them a few melodies, so I also turn up some that I love regularly. I never watched Star Wars and my boyfriend also never re-watched any movies since we know each other.But SOMEHOW our little monsters thought, that -from all the melodies they ever heard- they want to whistle Star Wars. The third time they heard the video-cockatiel whistle the theme, they already whistled along.Which is beautiful, but I honestly never expected one of my birds to whistle it. They do not know it fully yet and looks like they will only sing along, if they hear the melody, but still. They are on their way.

This happned when I was about 7 or 8. It was during the winter and I was sleeping however right b4 I woke up,i remembered this vivid dream. Me standing like 20 feet from my house porch and watching my brother and sister throw snow at one of their friends as she tried to sheild it with an umbrella. Weird right? Why did my brain just all of a Sudden think up such a vivid dream? I had no idea. Either way I went out to play that day and me my brother and sister went to have a snowball fight with the kids who live by our house. Midway through I think I got tired or cold so I walked away and was just watching them play from afar. And then I see it. I realized I was watching my dream. My brother and sister chase their friend done with snow until she's laying on the ground with the umbrella over her trying to shield away the snow. EXACTLY THE SAME WAY IT HAPPNED IN THE DREAM I HAD *THAT DAY*. LIKE WTF!!! I was standing in the same place, they were in the same place, wearing the same clothes and everything. HOW DID I UNKOWINGLY KNOW THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN AND WHY DID I KNOW SOMETHING THAT WAS SO UNSIGNIFICANT???? I still have no idea to this day why that happened and I haven't had a dream like that since.

There was this one kid named Adam P. He had blond hair and was white. I don�t remember getting to know him but we started �dating,� of course just a pair of kids who don�t know what they�re doing. He was a strange lad. He did a lot of really sexual things which highlighted his sexual behavior. There were to occasions that I remember of him and his incorrect behavior. The first was that the whole class was in the computer lab, don�t remember what for. The teachers told us that when we�re done to stand up and push in our chairs and stand there quietly before going back to class. Adam was a few chairs over to me. I turn to look at him and see him with his penis out and rubbing against the chair. The second was when we were �dating.� As in any regular kindergarten class we would sit criss-cross-applesauce. Once we were sitting together and he�d hold my hand and put our hands together �down there�. He never touched me though. What is really frightening to think about is how this little white boy could know of such things. Maybe his parents were abusing him. Maybe his older siblings tell him inappropriate things. The thing is is that something could have happened to this boy. Just wanted to share a little story. :|

This is my first reddit post, and I�m also posting from my mobile so sorry for the format. When I was a kid, around 7 or 8, I had a super creepy neighbor. He lived a couple houses down from me in this ugly run down trap house. He was seriously the typical scary neighbor whose house you would literally speed-walk by and never look up as you passed. He just seemed not completely normal, so it wasn�t a shock when my parents found him as a registered sex offender online. I really only had two major interactions with him and his dog but it was enough to make me a nervous and paranoid child. The first interaction was brief but frightening. I was playing with my little brother around our house. We must�ve been playing hide-n-seek because I thought it�d be a good idea to hide on the side of our house, between some bushes. As I was hiding I could hear footsteps coming towards me, I jumped out and yelled �Boo!� expecting my brother to be creeping up on me. It was the neighbor and his dog. The dog growled and snarled at me, and I ran into my house as fast as I could. The second interaction was with just his dog. His dog was a 60-70lb pitbull, and at the time I really didn�t know anything about pitbulls besides the fact that my creepy ass neighbor had a vicious one. Well one day my brother and I were playing with his friends outside one of their houses, when the neighbor�s dog came charging out of their house straight toward us. The dog in no way seemed excited or happy to see us, in fact it highkey looked like it wanted to rip us apart.  My brother and I, and all his friends, took off in several directions. Some friends ran straight into the house, some ran down the street, and my brother and I took off on bikes. The dog chased me down the street, barking and damn near foaming at the mouth. I screamed my fucking head off the entire time. Eventually I nearly flipped my bike and was forced to stop, leaving the dog to catch up with me. But once he got to me, I froze and so did the dog. He sniffed me, but stopped barking and just sat at my feet. I heard the neighbor�s girlfriends (plural bc im pretty sure he had several) screaming after me and the dog, so I ran and hid behind the car. I could hear the women say something along the lines of �what a little pussy ass bitch.� In hindsight, I definitely don�t blame the dog for his behavior or attitude considering how the owner conducted himself. I mean honestly, the dog was probably barking at my bike more so than at me, but at 7 or 8 you don�t really realize that.  It definitely scared me shitless though and made me become much more aware of the people around me. A couple month after these events my parents told me they saw him getting arrested at one of the gas stations in town. Haven�t since that creepy fuck ever since.

I told this story to one of my close friends, who told me it would be a good horror movie. There is a bit of gore in the dream, but I won't detail them. This is an actual nightmare I had as a kid that I remember vividly still, even after seventeen years.Little back story. I grew up with one older sister, and we've always had weird tastes for our age. I watched my first horror movie I believe at seven years old. It was Darkness Falls, and it fucked me up so badly I've never been able to finish it. That in itself is another story. All this to say: horror themes has been in my life since a very early age. It was the genre of movie we would rent a lot. I watched The Ring almost right after it came out on DVD.So the nightmare.I was about eight years old. I was sharing my bedroom with my older sister. She had the top bunk, I was at the bottom.The dream starts with an overview of the place. It was two massive forests separated by a very tall wall, taller than the tallest of trees. On one side, there was this very lovely, bright and colorful forest. There was also a big pink castle with lots of decorations and flowers everywhere. In front of the castle, there was something along the line of muppets talking and playing, as if they were filming a kids' TV show. That place existed for real, but was also filmed for children. They were singing and dancing, just being this typical colorful show kids love to watch.On the other side of the wall was a burnt, dark and gloomy forest. It was disgusting and dead. There was also a castle, except it was made of black bricks and had crows everywhere. As if I was only a camera watching what was happening, I entered the castle to see this stereotypical evil wizard sitting on a throne. He was holding a small ragdoll, the ones that usually have those 'mittens' hands, like I've always called them. You know, those dolls filled with cotton, with hair made of wool and with the fingers being one section with a thumb on the side. Like [those dolls.](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TTv-Ii2pL._SY355_.jpg) The dark wizard said something along the lines of 'You know what you need to do.' before putting the doll into a very colorful toy box. The box clearly didn't not fit in this black brick castle.Then cue back to the puppets doing a show. In a very cheerful voice, on of them say: 'Let's see what's in the toy box for us today!'When the puppet opens the toy box, the ragdoll jumps out and starts attacking those happy-go-lucky creatures. Just rips pieces of them off, with blood everywhere. The last thing the doll does is take off its face, as if it was on a band instead of being printed directly on the doll, then puts it on one of the elf like happy creatures. The band contracts and just blows the head up like some kind of ripe watermelon.I wake up with the faint memory of the screams of agony ringing in my ears. I slowly calm myself down, scared. I was just a child, this was some freaky nightmare. I turn on my side, looking out my bed. I notice something dangling from my sister's bed. It was a ragdoll hand.I turn again, hide in my blankets and refuse to move. I had two of those kind of ragdolls in my bed, there were gifts from my parents when I was a baby. Those ragdolls went into my closet and never moved from there, even now that I'm a grown adult. And I do mean the closet from my childhood. Like hell they would follow me to my apartment.As a funny sidenote, Annabelle the doll, the original one, is the same kind of doll I dreamed of all those years ago. Except the one in my dream had jet black hair. I remember she looked like Jade from Jackie Chan animated Adventures.

I recently went camping and witnessed a friend of a friend having a seizure. Every year we get together and go camping for the weekend. It's basically just heavy drinking at a campsite. I arrived the night before and woke up to my buddy's friend having a seizure. I woke up another friend of mine and told him what was happening. He promptly went and rolled him over on his side, while ensuring he couldn't hurt himself during the attack.I later discovered that he had sustained a serious brain injury a few years back. Thrice a day he has to take pills, and apparently he missed or vomited up his pills from the night before. I hope in the future he will always take his pills because that cannot be healthy or good for the body. Witnessing it was terrible but now I have an idea of what to do if it happens again.

I'm a law student in my third semester now and therefore have always been interesting in criminal cases etc. We were given the opportunity in school to get an internship anywhere we were accepted to for two weeks. So when I applied to a quite respectable law firm and was accepted there I was pretty excited because I knew that there would probably be some good cases to learn from. I got the opportunity to accompany one of the solicitors who was given the case of and defended a dude who had befriended only to then shoot the boyfriend of his sister (he sadly didn't survive). Since we were the defence team we were extremely early to the following court hearing to get prepared before it started. I was told to take a seat behind a glass wall where the 'spectators' were allowed to sit and watch for the sake of my own privacy etc., because the media would be coming since the case was quite big in our small town. As we were the first ones in court all seats were free so I sat in the first row to get the best view over everything going on. Long story short, after the court got filled and as did the seats next to me and behind me and the whole court hearing started I only realized that I was sitting right next to the accused's mother followed by the rest of his immediate family when  the victim's sister, which was the accused's (ex)girlfriend started crying as she spoke as a witness and was pointing at me while cussing out the dudes whole family (15 year old me was nearly shitting her pants). As the verdict was read out at the end of the hearing (life without the possibly of parole) and everybody beside and behind me started crying I felt so fucking uncomfortable because while I know that it's not easy for his family to hear him get send to jail they were still crying over a cold blooded murderer so I didn't actually feel any sympathy as such for any of them. Idk I never wanna get cursed out for wrongly being connected to a killer or have to sit amongst crying family members of one ever again. Shit was mad uncomfortable and unnerving and will stay with me even when I (hopefully) also become a solicitor one day

My name is Sophia I'm seventeen and I think someone hired a PI or a stalker because some events have taken place recently that make me think that someone has. I am an outdoors person, so I like to hike / walk / camp. I live out in the countryside with my parents we live in a small wooded valley with not much activity and my closest neighbours are my grandparents (who are out at the time I posted this) other than that my closest neighbours are 1 to 1 and a half miles away. As I said not much goes on around here so when a man started parking along the road it kinda creeped me out. Every time I went out in my car the man would follow me, driving down all the roads that I drove down. The man drives a black Honda civic, tinted windows you can barley see through. I went into the closest town one day and met my girlfriend in a caf�. She noticed that the Civic that pulled up next to me was still there, one person still inside. After me had tea and cakes we went for a walk. On the drive up to the trail my girlfriend noticed the guy was still following me.  We got to the trail. Got out and went for our walk. About an hour or two later we got back to my car to see the Black Civic still there. I dropped her of at her house then drove back to mine. The man pulled up next to me. About an hour or two later the man left. Ill update at my earliest convenience or when something interesting happens.Update:The guy has the audacity to drive up to my house. Normally I would think nothing on it as my house has a drive whereMost people turn around but at 9:00 pm I doubt think so. I knocked on the guys window finally confronting him. He took a few seconds and I saw through the windows (heavily tinted) that he reached for an atlas under his seat. When he wound down the window he looked at me and asked watch way [redacted] adress was. The adress he stated was three miles back down the road. He thanked me, drove off. I looked out of the window just out of curiosity to see the motherfucker just behind the hedge with binoculars in his lap. He just went up the drive, turned around and left. Hopefully for the day.Update: I was on my way to school on the train and after two stops the man in be suit got on. I was quick to notice him and I called my parents. My mum asked if I recognised him from school and I stressed the fact that I hadn't. After giving the number plates to the police that morning I decided to call them to the stop I got off on. When the stop rolled around about fifteen minutes later I got off and the man followed me as we left the station the police surrounded us. I ran to the closest officer as they detained the man. (the police only threatened the man with tasers because i live in England where the police don't carry firearms) The man was detained and it turns out he was an ex detective turned stalker the police knew him well and he was fired from his position as a detective for stalking and even going as far as sexually assaulting many young women. I was lucky just to be followed.Last update: I just left the police station and I was told the guy was carrying two kitchen knives and a small handgun. Fuck. I was lucky.

when i was like in 4th grade, i joined this coding club. one day we were doing some easy online activity about coding colors or something. we were all doing and this one kid was trying to do it, but he was really struggling. the guy running it went over to him and was like �bro what�s going on? this is pretty easy� keep in mind this kid is pretty smart, and definitely understood what was being taught. at this time the whole class is looking at them. the kid looks at the instructor for a few seconds with a strange look on his face and said �well it�s kinda hard for me. i�m color blind�

So after school (I wear a school uniform) I went to the park and climbed a tree just to read, listen to music, etc. Usually people just avoid going near the tree I sit in while I�m in it since there�s so much space around the park and no need for you to really go near me, and I enjoy this solitude. But there was a man (mid to late 30�s, greying beard, lil chubby, sunglasses and leather jacket) walking his dog. He got pretty close to the tree and was staring at me so I took out my earbud and said �Uh hi?� And he goes �Oh hi I�m just wondering how you got up there.� So we made small talk and I decided this person was harmless and even said he had a cute dog.  I thought that was the end of that interaction. About 10 minutes later he starts walking back towards the tree and passing me, staring at me again. So I waved and said bye since it looked like he was leaving the park. He stops by the tree and starts striking up conversation again. And then he asked me how old I was, I politely said I�m 17 but you could clearly see from my school uniform that I�m underaged.And then he asked me, �Do you like older guys?� I politely said no. I was so shocked that he asked me this question. I barely knew what to do. I called my friend and I told her what happened and I couldn�t stop laughing. It was just such a weird interaction and I never ever thought this could happen to me in real life. Like online, sure, people get bold because they�re not face to face but the fact that he would face me and ask this question was so baffling to me and so freaking hilarious. I just had to share this with people lmfao

I am 13 and live in Canada just to make that clear and last night I was sleeping for a decent amout of time for me, when my dog started barking his head off and woke me up. I let him out of my room and peaked out to see my mom with a baseball bat and on the phone with 911. At the door there was a man with his hood up pounding on our door and trying to unlock it. Me being the weirdo I am grabbed my knife that is in my room and stood there with my head slightly peaked out my bedroom door. My mom is weak and I could here her talking on the phone saying she was gonna pass out. This was when I knew I had to do something. Since my room is in the basement I ran my little ass to the furnace room where the gun safe is. I know what you guys may think a 13 year knowing where we keep the guns but my family is from the east coast and we are big hunters. I have always known where the key was so I quicky got the little .410 gauge and loaded all the while my legs were about to give out any moment. I was about half way up the stairs when my mom saw me and told me to put it away because 3 cops were almost here so I put it back as fast as I could because I didn't want to start anything with the police. They arrived and the man didn't even resist. He was apparently super drunk and forgot where he lived. Turns out he lives nearby because he did the same thing to my sisters house but my parents hid it from me. My mom did not press any charges because it seemed like a honest mistake and just wanted him to get home. My Dad was working nights out on site btw. My mom told me that I had proved to her that I wasn't scared. I guess she thought that with my high anxiety that I might freak out but I stayed calm until it all hit me afterwards. Thats pretty much all I have to tell and before we get comments saying that this is fake you have the right to believe in whatever you would like but that was by far the scariest night I had. Btw sorry for punctuation its 4:30 here and im on mobile. English is my first language so bash me about that.

Obligatory I�m on mobile so bad formatting also first text post.Just over a year ago when I was in 8th grade me and this girl, who I will call H, were friends of friends. However, for a long time before this I had wanted to date her. I obviously wanted to at least get to be better friends with her and we had our first two classes together I sat next to her in both I would stay a little bit after and just talk with H.  And everyday for months I would do this and on the way in and out of 1st and 2nd period since we were always the last people of out the class I would hold the door open for her. I was never really trying to imply anything I just thought it was a polite thing to do. Now after months of this one of our mutual friends put 2 and 2 together. She told another one of our friends who then black mailed me into asking her out. So on our way to an after school club when no one was in the hall way I asked her out very very VERY awkwardly because at this point we had been friends for almost a year and I didn�t want to break something that was good. We talked it out as much as we could I got denied but we stayed friends mainly because she was dating a girl in our grade (she�s bi). However, we kept talking for around a month until they broke up and a couple weeks later we got together she said one of the reasons she began to like me was because I was polite and held open the doors for her always. We have now been together for a year and 3 months. And I have no idea how to end this story so bye I guess. And sorry if this was boring.

I used to dream of a house when I was younger. I wanted to live in a huge home with lofts, a spiral staircase, a huge attic, tall ceilings, and space to vacuum. That last bit will make sense as a child�s dream by the end of this, I promise. I had big dreams for this imaginary house. A house that I�m sure would cost millions in our present economy. But I never knew that, It couldn�t be much more expensive than the house we live in. We moved for the first and only time when I was 3. Too young to really remember. But I do remember visiting our old house. It was a lot like the home of my fantasies, but without a spiral staircase or an attic. I would have to keep dreaming for that one. But it was a beautiful home on top of a hill in rural Virginia. We left in search of more money. My parents couldn�t afford to keep that house and raise two small children on my father�s measly teacher salary. In Northern Virginia he would be paid more. We could live comfortably. So we left. We moved from our big tall farm house in Appalachia to a �four bedroom� in NOVA. It�s in quotes because really only two of the rooms are large enough for an adult to live in. The one I got was the larger of the two tiny rooms, and the smaller became my dad�s office. It�s cramped now, with barely enough space for a desk and chair let alone a whole bed set. But it�s packed with baseball stuff, a computer, and an old TV so it feels like a useful room. One of the things that really must happen when moving from a large home to a small home is purging your unnecessary items. I�m not sure that that ever really happened for my family. Our house is still filled with boxes that were never unpacked after moving 20 years ago. There are unpacked boxes from my grandmothers death. My grandpa�s death. My grandad�s. Each loss of life stuffs my home with more things we can�t get rid of and pinches the already limited living space. There are rooms we no longer enter, parts of the house we elect not to touch or clean because it would unearth too much. Too much. We cling to these objects with no more value to them than their memories. Memories we might not even possess ourselves but that died in the minds of an older generation. An older generation whose things we now store in unlabeled boxes shoved into the spaces between our own unlabeled boxes. I dream of a home where I can vacuum. Where the only things on the floor are furniture and the dirt and dust i suck up. Where the only stacks of boxes are found in the pantry or collapsed waiting to be used for the next yard sale. Where I can rearrange the furniture if I want to because there isn�t so much that only one configuration of the room will work without sacrificing the ability to walk. I dream of not having to fret over the piles of paper and documents and books and files and newspapers and mail toppling and swallowing me whole. I dream of vacuuming.

Not much but in 6th grade final period the class was talking and being super loud so the weird kid said out of the blue I CANNOT TAKE THIS ANYMORE and reached in her bag the whole class was like shoot it�s about to go down but luckily she was reaching for her pencil so she can draw to calm herself down there was a sigh of relief throughout the whole entire classroom.



******************************



I had my first ever stirrings (mini-feelings) for one girl when I went to a State to compete on a national level; she went for painting, I for poetry; along with a dozen other people from my own state in our respective streams. (I never had crushes or anyone before this, I was 15)
 Our stay at the place in the State was for only a week and we'd see each other (all of us, in which some people had groups) for only a few hours. We'd get own from our own buildings housing boys/girls, hang a bit then go into our respective venues for the competition for many hours and then reconvene for a few hours, have dinner, and then sleep.
 During this time, I somehow saw the girl (lets call her Arc) more close to me than others; lukeI could just goof or be myself without holding back and I really liked her personality too.
 After the week ended, we boarded a plane back to our state and on the plane, we had adjacent seats. I had the good opportunity to tell her a dirty joke to which she strangled me. Good times.
 I'd identify her as a more boy-ish girl that you could hang around with and discuss whatever without thinking 'she's a girl I should hold back this sentence' and just get along.
 So, the plane ride ended and we part ways from then and there, never have I talked to her to this day. After we went our own ways, I experienced tiny little things. Was that her on the street? Is that her face? I kept seeing faces on the ride to a place to a place to stay the night before taking the final travel to my own district. I kept thinking of her, I talked alot about
 There was another person from my district who also came and seeing this symptoms, he could see that I had a sort of feelings for her but je wouldn't say outright. And the coming years, these feeling died down.

Fast forward 2 years, I'm doing my Class 12 in a different state now. That was when I properly met, lets say, Random. She was different from Arc but retained the basic 'can talk to her as I would a boy' trait.
 We did first see each other (glances really) during the exams of Class 11 but never really got 'close' till Class 12.
 The students of my community got selected to perform a cultural dance some months later, so we all practised together and that's when our friendship took off. We had a lot of similar tastes and she was friendly (and only later did I find out she was the coaxing on the outside, mentally harmed on the inside kind.)
 At some point she started having a crush on me but I didn't really notice it and Andrew (not his name) and a few others played cupid to try to pressure us into  relationship. There was a time during a bus ride where we sat near each other and and I made her sleep  on my shoulder and this being observed by Andrew and the lot thought "UwU love couple".
 I didn't believe when Andrew not-so-sublu told me that she was crushing on me, so there was no hide and seek going on. And I didn't see her as she did me because she was just a really good buddy.
 But a few months later when we were attending a farewell program for our Vice-Principal (it was a small program of mostly just the dance practitioners because it was a private program hosted by us as the Vice was a community member as well), after the program, I thought "Heck, Imma just get into this relationship" and just asked her out when there weren't people close by. Thus I attained my first girlfriend.
 It was a very uneventful relationship of mostly texting and after 2 weeks, mostly phone calls late night and would span hours on end. (we texted even before the relationship) And we didn't even really hang out, even at school because by this time, we had already went to perform the dance and we couldn't practice anymore. We also didn't have same streams and we didn't see each other much.
 I don't know what was the unconscious trigger but during our phone call sessions, I used to say something along the lines of "you deserve better than me" a lot, which I would later stop saying. I guess she never let up any sign of withdrawal because she always seemed so receiving every time we talked. But after the third-ish week of our relationships, my calls didn't get through and later I would learn that I was blocked. At school she didn't even say much of that and first terminal exams were coming up anyways. After the exams were over she told me she needed to Tal to me and then she broke up with me (I guess she stopped having feelings and perhaps got bored or had someone else). I wasn't particularly crushed over but ai did start to develop intimate feelings for her but she snuffed that out quickly. We "dated" each other for 1 month-ish.
 After that, she blocked me on every known platform like she did every ex she had (all four before me) and all ex-friends.
 Later I learned that she grew up in a very hostile environment which were filled with abusive father, abusive kids of the neighbourhood, school bullies at the all-girls school she went to for a long time. Thus, pushing people away was easy for her if she didn't need or trust anymore.
 After that, we rarely talked and whenever we met, it was super awkward. I would've been fine if I was a normal friend for her but she somehow had the need to cringe and turn away every time she saw me.
 And that's all with this silly story of my teenage romance and to this day, I don't know what I did wrong but I'll leave it at cringe and monotonous at the moment. Thanks for reading!

So, I had Gym for 6 period. We had a sub, and they let us do anything outside. Me and my friend, his fake name will be Alex, walked and talk. Then a random dude can and said "DUDE GOT RABIES". We had no idea what was going on, until we see the ADHD kid walking weird. About 8 kids ran behind us and one of them said "ALBERTO GOT RABIES." We just decided to run to the field. Then the ADHD kid followed us. People were running and screaming. I just look to my phone and scroll through Reddit, then a kid grabbed my neck and said "Sacrifice!" I kicked him and ran. 15 later I'm starting to believe that the kid got rabies. Then the bell rings. I grab my stuff and ran to my next class.

(Just a few notes: 1. I really suck with grammar so please don't vilify me, 2.This takes place  in the the scp universe in a timeline when scp-001 [When day breaks](http://www.scp-wiki.net/shaggydredlocks-proposal) fucks the world over 3.Sorry for the shortness i may do more stories based off this and that's all... Please enjoy...)  You hear them running after you from your jeep as you drive it 80 mph on some back roads in the shadowy mountains to a hideout you made from some "foundation" site, after a bit of driving you don't here them anymore so you slow down as your car approach a empty parking lot in front of a large steel building with that all familiar foundation logo, You park the car in a spot with a sign "Parking spot reserved for ~~facility overseer~~  Best damn guy in the universe." You turn the car off and take off your head wrap knowing its ok because the mountains are your savior that wont forsake you, But something feels off and you cant shake the feeling of it as you leave your car and enter the facility. When you enter the facility you start your regular duty's, Checking the security footage for breaches, maintaining the equipment you use often, and many other duty's. Once those were all done and start heading to your quarters to sleep all this off you here a ping from a main terminal whit a fair amount of recordings from other people at different facility's so you decide to check it out... You get to the terminal sitting in a office chair and look at the new recording labeled "Site 19 has fallen" you play it  and the recording starts, "DAMN IT GREY! WE NEED TO RECORD THIS SO PEOPLE LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES! \*the voice clears his throat\* Grey just make sure they don't get in..." there was a slight pause from the voice as gunshots can be herd from the recording "This is Dr.Klen Site 19 has fallen... We have tried to fight back but learn from our mistakes please for the love of all that is sane... Project outro colonize has been put on standby for the time being until site 19 can be retaken from them... This message will be sent to all sites that are still functional and to all of the world as well... God bless you all" in the backround a voice pipes up "Dr.K THERE IN THE VENTS GO" gunshots ring out as Klen speaks again "Shit.." the recording stops there

My wife and I were visiting different churches in our area on Sunday mornings, trying to find one that �we� liked. (I�m not really into church anymore. Was raised Pentecostal, enough said?)One morning we visited a Baptist church a few miles from the house. They were already a few minutes into the service when we walked in. It was a crowd of mostly elderly white people. We took our seats in the back and, you know, did what you do in church; listened to the sermon, followed along with our bibles, and bowed our heads during prayer. At the end of the sermon, the preacher said a prayer and was about to release release the church. But first he look in our general direction. I�m paraphrasing, but he basically said, �This church is not for everyone and sometimes we get new people coming in and they don�t come back, and we�re okay with that.� There was more to it, but I believe that was his way of asking us not to come back. Both of us took the hint and it was awkward as fuck trying to leave in a way where we wouldn�t have to talk to anyone. And it felt a little demeaning to think that we were not welcome at a church.You can say a lot about the Pentecostal variety of church, but I�ve never seen anyone treated like that before inside a supposed house of god. Aren�t churches supposed to accept anyone who is looking for faith and the like?

So back when I would have been six, this funny story played out, that I still can't manage to forget... It was at school, and we were all lining up boy-girl lines. Just for context, this was back in the time when 'Boy colours' and 'Girl colours' were a big thing in school. I was wearing purple underwear, And I wanted everyone to know I wasn't scared to wear 'girl colours' so I told the guy in front of me to pull my pants down... I stood there for a number of seconds, before realizing that he pulled a little more than just my pants down, and since I was right beside the girl line, one of them shouts "Ewwww \*MyName\*" and I looked down, And instantly regretted my actions. I quickly pulled my pants up, and shouted "It was \*Name Of The Kid I asked To Do IT!\* and from that moment onward, I can't get it out of my head.. How stupid could I have been lmao. Nobody ever talked about it after that point but I still can't bring myself to forget it haha

So this is my first time posting on Reddit and this is a very long story so please bare with me,This is a story how I was wrongly accused of rape.&#x200B;It all starts last year in August, I started dating this girl, (lets name her G for short) G was lovely, sweet, kind and beautiful.Or so I thought, Inside of her was dark core, Depressed, Suicidal, Self Conscious. Not a good mix for a anxiety and hot head like me, Every thing was perfect till school started, We were a happy couple. Then her friends started messing with me, They gave me hard times for being with her, To the point where I tried breaking up with her multiple times, But I stupidly let her drag me back in. Every little problem I kept bottling up, Letting her walk all over me, I am also pretty sure she cheated on me with A transgender (Girl To Boy, We will call him C) C was an alcoholic and a druggie, I kept trying to pry G away from C because I didn't want G to get addicted to drugs. I secretly was self harming myself because of all this pressure, In October, I had a grand mall Seizure, (I had ADHD) they took me off my meds, I wasn't myself for a long time. We had sex in late October, Everything kept leading up to a breakup in November, After I broke up with her, All of her friends accused me of so many things, It was crazy, And the principle believed it all, I was thrown out of school, I lost all my friends, I didn't even know she accused me of rape until February when two investigators came to my house. I gave them my statement and they left. Throughout this whole time, I was being turned left and right, I didn't go to court until April, It was all so much stress, Im not going to lie, I wasnt in the right state of mind and I tried offing myself. The first hearing I was ordered to do Probation and have a sex offender assessment test,I was asked many questions, At the end I was offered Sex Offender Counseling, I declined it because I didnt see why I had to when I didnt even to anything wrong, I kept having hearings and it kept being extended and I just wanted it to be over so I could move on, Then August 16th, I had my final hearing, I was given a choice, Plea Deal, Or go to a real court and testify against her, I took the plea deal because I didn't want to see her at all, Seeing G might of put me back into that depression, I took the plea and said I was Out of my parents control (idk why this is a thing but thank god it is.) I now have 1 year of Probation, Healthy Relationship Counseling, And can finally move on with my life. Im doing much better now and I feel happy where I am.Thanks for reading, Sorry for how long this is..&#x200B;/

I went to IT in theaters when it came out and we were waiting  for the movie to start, when a guy came in dressed as Pennywise. He made his way to the back of the theater and sat by himself for a few minutes and then 5 minutes into the movie he got up and walked out looking over his shoulder like he was hiding something. I thought he must just be using the restroom or getting snacks, no big deal. Well, the movie keeps playing and he is gone for the entire thing and with 10 minutes left he comes back in still looking over his shoulder occasionally. This time he sits in the front. My palms started sweating and I immediately started imagining scenarios in my head where he had left to load his guns in the restroom and get everything ready to commit a shooting similar to the dark night one. I knew the odds were slim to none, but it really bothered me to the point where I begged my wife and we left the theater before the movie was over. Nothing ended up happening in that theater, but it still gives me chills thinking of it because I was convinced a tragedy was about to go down.

 A peaceful Saturday in fifth grade, late in the morning, and I had woken up to play The Sims on our family computer. I was making my little house, with my little family and all the little people. My brother and his best friend Colby were upstairs playing Call Of Duty. I was placing down a pink tree from the Katy Perry expansion pack, I wanted a garden, when I heard a scream, yelling, and Colby came running down the stairs yelling for me to go. His face was red and he was sobbing, terrified. I didn�t even have time to put shoes on before sprinting out into the street.My mother had just swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills in the bath and left a suicide note. My father had found her and was trying to make her puke them up. We found my siblings and all of us ran. We hid in fear of what was happening. We thought our dad had attacked our mom.He came and got us eventually. He carried my youngest sister home. There was an ambulance, fire trucks and police in front of my house. My brother and Colby had to talk to them since they saw what happened.My dad sat us down inside and explained what was going on, and that mommy had to go away.I knew what it was. I knew what she did.I said as much.When my sister asked what my dad meant, I was blunt and responded �It means she tried to kill herself�My little pink tree was still waiting to be placed, the cheery music still playing.I deleted that little happy family.I found the suicide note that night. I read it. I don�t remember what it says, but I�ll never forget what it made me feel. I never told anybody I read it. I doubt I ever will. My mother recovered, she�s still alive, but I still remember that day in fifth grade. I remember the sims music. I remember that pink little tree and the screaming. I remember the day my mother attempted suicide

To start off, I am a 19 year old girl, I�ve been really poor recently, and it�s hard to pay for school and medical needs. I live in a relatively small and uneventful town, and all the jobs within my qualifications are taken: so I decided to try something a bit different� sex work. Anyway, I�ll get to the meat (hue hue hue) of my story.So about a week ago, I�m lying in bed, watching YouTube, when I get a message from this guy. He seems to be another generic creepo hellbent on doing unspeakable things to some young lady. He says something along the lines of �you want to get together and get nasty?�, and I start thinking. I think �I�m not into this guy at all, but what if I could make money off of him?� I mull it over for a bit while I�m watching my video, and about an hour later, I say fuck it and message this guy �Okay, I�ll do it, but I demand to be paid for it.� I start low, and surprisingly, he accepts.Now, because I�m not totally distant, I decide to talk to him a bit more, get him riled up before we meet. It goes well, and I learn quite a bit about him. He seems to be a rather solitary man, quite old, fairly unkempt, and seems to be quite the smoker. I�m not gonna judge on the smoking part, as I have my fair share of bad habits in that regard, but everything else just screamed nasty to me. Nonetheless, I decided to push on, thinking of the money I was gonna get after the encounter.Not much happened until the day before I met him. I was supposed to meet him that day, and I was trying to mentally prepare myself for it� but relatively late in the day, he decided to bail on me. I was a little relived, but also disappointed I couldn�t just do my job and get paid. I go to bed that night relatively unsatisfied, and thinking that I somehow might�ve come on a little too strong or made some kind of mistake. Those thoughts were quickly put to rest; however, as the next day arrives and I wake up to a ton of messages about how horny this poor sod is. I decide to tease him further, talking about how my butt is the most shapely he�ll ever see, the fact that I�m amazing at giving oral (I�m not with guys), and that I�m getting wet down there just thinking about it (also a lie). It works, and I�m almost certain he won�t flake at this point.I was right.He says that he can be over near my place soon, and I agree to meet him there. He sends me a text saying that he�ll be there in an hour, and upon reading it, I start getting ready in the second most revealing and loose outfit I�ve ever worn. I throw on a small crop top, and put on a pair of shorts low enough to allow my panties to be clearly visible. I start shaving my legs, and by the time I�m done, I hear a message sound from my room. It�s him again, and he says that he�ll be here in 10 minutes. Immediately, my heart starts pounding. My heart drops, and I keep getting tremors. I start to think of all the bad shit that can happen: what if he has a saw in the back of his car and he wants to dismember me and throw my body in the river? What if he�ll hold a gun to my head and demand I suck him off multiple times for free, and I have to tearfully keep going as I get verbally abused? What if he chains me up in the back of his van and sells me to some awful person to be used as a sex slave? My mind was absolutely racing with all these negative possibilities, when suddenly� I heard another noise, and in the moment, it sounded as loud as a church bell ringing. It was another message from him, simply reading �I�m parked outside [STORE].�Through my shakiness, I decided to respond �be there soon.� I needed a moment to mentally prepare myself, not only was I going out in a very revealing outfit, but I was also going to suck some random guy�s dick in exchange for money. Needless to say, I had a massive pit in my stomach, and I was once again filled with more tremors. After taking a few minutes to calm down, I stepped outside of the house, and started the walk over to his car. I had drank a bottle of cider a few minutes earlier, so I didn�t feel as shaky, but the pit in my stomach was still ever present. Stepping outside in my current attire felt like walking into the arctic with a bathing suit: the wind was blowing straight through my thin crop top, and my legs being almost entirely visible made me feel quite� shameful, for lack of a better word. As my guy friends probably would�ve said �u/sexworkthrowaway01, you look like a slut�, and honestly, I�m not denying it, it was true.Despite all this, I decided to press on, pushing through my shame. As I was walking there, I kept repeating a mantra to myself in my head, �think about the $20� I said, if I was getting more nervous, I�d say it louder. The walk there felt like a while, but I knew I was there when I saw the same man through the open window of his car. I said in a semi-dominant tone �show me the money� - in reality, it was probably more shaky and quiet than anything - and he showed me the $20, and told me to get in the back. I got in the quite spacious back of his car, and to my surprise, there were no hacksaws, there wasn�t any chains, and heck, there was nothing back there but seats and a few miscellaneous trash items. I let out a sigh of relief, thinking to myself �okay, I�m probably not gonna be killed today�, my thoughts were cut a little short though, as I heard the door open, and the man walk in, closing the door behind him. He slowly pulled himself over and sat down, and gestures over to a small rug near the driver seat. I knew what he wanted me to do, I swallowed my pride before placing the rug in front of me, kneeling on it, and opening wide. With one last stare into the man�s eyes, I descended onto his cock, sucking. Truth be told, it wasn�t as disgusting as I thought, he had bothered to trim his pubic hair a little, but I wasn�t at all sexually attracted to this man (or any man for that matter, but that�s another story for another time). I wasn�t seeing any of it even as a sexual encounter, I was just seeing it as a disgusting job that I do for the money, we�re both satisfied, and then we go off on our merry way. With those thoughts in my head, I continued sucking.During the sucking, I started to gag. I made a quiet cough, and my eyes started tearing up. I kept going anyway and pushing through it, but then I heard him say something, I didn�t hear what he said, so I stopped for a second for him to speak. He said �are you ok?�, and in a faux show of confidence (and also so he didn�t want his money back), I said �don�t worry, I�m just getting started.� And with that, it was back to work. Really quickly into it, I not only started to realize the drooling I was doing, but the fact that the car was off with the windows closed, and thus, I was sweating profusely, tearing up, and my mouth was wet. But did I stop? No. He paid for a sexual service, and I�d be damned if I let him down. I wanted word of mouth to spread and possibly get more money, so that�s one of my only options. Anyway, it was nearing the 20 minute mark, and he was showing no signs of cumming. I needed to change things up a little. I got up, and started teasing him by grinding against him lightly� he let out a smile, and right then, I knew it was working. I continued for a bit more, and despite me feeling uncomfortable about him, my sexy talk had gotten him more in the mood. Quickly, and desperate not to seem exhausted and amateurish, I decided to finish him off by going quicker. Surprisingly, I felt his legs shake, and after a bit of jaw straining, blindingly fast action, I managed to make him cum.I got my money, stepped out of his car, and told him �spread the word� before I left. My panties were ruffled, there was cum on my mouth, but I did it, I fucking did it. I triumphantly held out my money and went back home, showering and instantly changing into nicer clothes. I�d say, it was a job well done.I might�ve gotten myself farther than I ever thought I would into this rabbit hole, but I�m not particularly worried. If this guy was any indication, most of my clients won�t be psychopaths, but just normal, often older men who just need a lil� something.

Things I should mention before I tell this story: 1.My house was realativly modest in size 2. We had a chain link fence bordering the backyard. 3. Behind the house is a few miles of woodland. Okay so I was in 5th grade at the time coming home on Valentine's day weekend. It was a pretty typical day, my mom was at work and our family friend who we will call Tyler was "babysitting" us. My eldest sister was coming down with the flu and my mom had to work over night, so Tyler had stay overnight. Around 7:30 my younger sister (who i shared a room with) was sent to bed, a few hours after probably around 9 or 10 I decided it was time for me to sleep too. My younger is woken up by some banging outside and goes to get Tyler, he concluded that the noise was just her imagination and that she could come in the guest room with him if she wanted, he told me that if I hear something I should come get him and me and my sisters should hide. I go back into my room and lay on my bed, a little on edge, and then I hear the thumping. I dashed out of my room and told Tyler he woke up my older sister who was on the couch and told us to go into the bathroom with a kitchen knife and lock the door. Tyler went to my parents room to grab the rifle my step dad kept in the closet, I couldn't help but follow him I then stopped when he walked out on the back porch as I was scared, he yelled some threats out and told me it was safe to come out with him. First he walked to my window to find the board that blocked off under the house was standing vertically and there was dirty shoe marks from where someone tried to climb through the window. Second he checked the fence to find it had been cut by pliers and the gate to lead out of the backyard had been kicked open. This is not the best story ever (as it happened 6 or 7 years ago) it is also my first one. If I need to clarify on anything please tell me, and thanks for reading!

I was in Sydney with my little brother and his friends to celebrate his birthday. We were supposed to go to a giant bouncy castle called The Big Bounce Australia, which is apparently, the biggest bouncy castle in the world. BUT it was SO fucking hot that the staff had to deflate the entire thing and inflate it again at a different time of the day. We decided that we would rather go than stand in the hot sun longer.Obviously, a little disappointed that we had to cut it short, my mum decided that instead of going home, we would go into a nearby supermarket that had an indoor ice rink. Everyone was down for it but I wanted to go home but then I realized that the supermarket is air-conditioned so I was for it. We parked in the parking lot and went in the supermarket. We headed over to where the ice rink was and then got inside.My little brother and his friends all quickly got their ice skates but I didn't really want to ice skate so I decided to sit with my mum as we watched them skate. Just as I was about to relax my mum asked me to get a drink for her. I agreed of course so she gave me a total of $25 and I got up and went to get her drink. Now, there is a vending machine literally right next to the ice rink where I could easily get her drink quickly, BUT I was interested in what other shops there were since I had never been to this place before and there may be some cool shops.. So instead of going for the easy option, I went ahead and decided to say that I was going to get her drink from a store, which was obviously an excuse to look around the store. And this is where the story starts.The supermarket I was in had multiple floors with lots of shops so I went through each and every floor only to be disappointed because nearly all of the stores there were clothes stores. After looking at every floor I decided to do what I was actually supposed to be doing and get mum's drink. I found some random vending machine and put in $5 for a Coke bottle. Then I got my change and of course the Coke bottle and just as I was about to start walking back a tiny but fast stream of Coke started spraying out of the bottom of the bottle. Panicked, I quickly put my mouth over the spraying Coke and turned it upside down. It seems like the Coke bottle had a tiny hole at the bottom of it and would spray Coke if I held it the regular way.Now any normal person would've thrown the bottle away and got a new one but me being the dumb ass I am decided to run down to the pharmacy that I saw earlier and buy a pack of bandades and stick them on the hole because that will work out fine! Along with the bandades I bought a bottle of Gatorade for myself as well leaving me with $12. With my newly bought bandades I opened them up outside the store put one on the hole and then tested to see if the bottle would leak and of course it did. So I stuck ANOTHER one on the hole and it once again leaked. Feeling defeated and stupid that I just wasted my on bandades for nothing I got a call from my mum so I answered the call. The following is the conversation in a nutshellMe: Hey mumMum: Where are you?Me: *\*explains everything that happened\**Mum: Stop being an idiot and just throw out the bottle and buy a new one.So of course I listened and threw out the annoying bottle and went out to find a store that had Coke bottles and I eventually found one which was a store that sold Japanese food/drinks and thankfully they had Coke bottles. I grabbed the bottle from the fridge and decided to check my pockets just in case I had enough money but I have $12 so of course I-Wait, I can only feel coins.. Where the fuck is the $10 note!? Well it TURNS out that the $10 note I had in my pocket FELL out while I was looking for a store. So that brings my $12 down to $3. Now I hate myself even more than I do for not zipping up my pocket so I just have to pray that this Coke bottle is under $3. So, I walk over to the counter and put down the Coke bottle and of course with my shit luck it's $3.60. I say politely that I don't have enough money to buy it and walk away to put it back. During that moment as I walked back I've never wanted to die more. Feeling more stupid and defeated than before I started walking out of the store but then I realized "Wait a minute, I have a credit card".I had been so focused on the $25 my mum gave me that I forgot that I had a credit card with over $200 in it. I walked back to the fridge and pulled out the Coke bottle once again and marched towards the counter but while I was doing this the same girl who I told I didn't have enough money was moving some boxes and both of our eyes met. As soon as this happened I realized that it probably  looked like that I was stealing a Coke bottle, So I was quick to awkwardly explain that I forgot I had a credit card. She looked at me weirdly probably thinking something like "lmao what a tard" she just said ok to me with a weird look on her face. So then after that I quickly bought the Coke bottle and hastily walked out of the store... Why am I so autistic?Now that I finally had mum's drink I started walking back down to where the ice rink was but then I realized that I was lost and I had no idea where the hell the ice rink was. Any normal person would probably ask someone if they knew where the ice rink was but no way in hell was I gonna talk to a person. So I spent the next 10 minutes wandering aimlessly around the store until I built up the courage to ask some random indian guy if he knew where the ice rink was  and thankfully he knew. He led me to the ice rink and sure enough I was in front of the entrance to it. Thank you, Indian guy.I walked back to where my mum was and gave her the drink and told her what happened. And she laughed, Apparently I was gone for an hour, AN HOUR. Getting drinks from the vending machine would have been way easier and would have taken only 2 minutes but MY dumb ass decided to make it longer and harder for myself! An hour just for a fucking Coca Cola bottle, I hate myself for being such and idiot. If I just went to the vending machine right next to the ice rink I wouldn't have had to go through all of that shit. As everyone was laughing their asses of I realized that I haven't drank my Gatorade yet. Maybe all of that awkwardness and suffering wasn't for nothing, maybe this Gatorade is my reward for doing this! I opened up the bottle and took a sip...&#x200B;It's not even good.&#x200B; Tl;dr -  Spent an hour suffering and being awkward while trying to find a drink for my mum

As the title suggests my local highschool has a member of its student body who is yes, a crackhead, due to embarrassing subject matter I will change all names to protect him and all others involved in this constantly evolving storyThank you for being considerate.My senior year of highschool started as most do, I�m excited about graduation and moving on to bigger and better things. My highschool is located smack dab in the middle of the current opioid crisis otherwise known as Appalachia, being a country minded gentlemen I�m not one to scorn at people for how they dress or how much money they have but like most people in this area I will judge you by how you carry yourself and by how you treat me and others. With that being said my first look at Jeff (named changed) wasn�t a look of judgement it was a look of confusion like I had seen him before but I was unable to process it, a day or so had past when I seen him again in between classes in the hallway and then it hit me like a Mack truck loaded down with 2 ton of bricks, � oh my god, that�s fucking Jeff� a boy who I used to attend elementary school with, I remembered him being held back during 3rd or 4th grade but I wondered how is he a freshman, �had he really been held back that many times?� I wondered to my self A few days had past and I saw Jeff again, this time he was wearing a camo hoodie, very common in these parts, but it was what was printed on the front that had me totally confused but also so amused. In white vinyl a outline of 2 birds that seemed to be pheasants one quite large and the other small, with the words �my cock,(below the larger of the 2), your cock (below the smaller bird) seeing this I bursted out into laughter and then I began to wonder, �how has he not be dress coded yet, and sent home� the answer to this I still do not have as he has worn that hoodie almost everyday since August and no one had said a word. After the encounter with his size comparison hoodie I began to become intrigued and I started keep my eye out for crackhead Jeff ,as he�s known around school, simply due to his obvious drug use included but not limited to, meth scabs on his face, constant bad behavior, his overall crackhead appearance and attitude, and his completely unpredictable behavior. For the past 5 months I have studied and observed him and his circle of friends behavior here is just a small outline of their antics. But keep in mind these are just the most memorable as crackhead Jeff and his clan do funny and outlandish things on a daily basis.My most memorable event so far has been when Jeff�s girlfriend got into a fight, in our school most homosexual individuals and our overall outcasts seem to stick together, so when a perceived to be lesbian who�s name I forget got into a fight with Jeff�s girlfriend  let�s just say it was an event for the ages. I did not witness this but as I was getting breakfast (because nutrition is important) i noticed a small argument between crackhead Jeff and his girlfriend vs. the lesbian girl and her guy friend I didn�t think much about it, �that bunch is always so damn loud� I said to my friend as we walked past a few minutes later as we rounded the corner of the hallway I heard yelling, I stoped turned around and saw blood on the floor, and our art teacher pulling the lesbian off Jeff�s girlfriend, and then I saw Jeff and his girlfriend hurry into the nearby elevator, I then turned around and rushed down the stairs to try to catch up to the couple as they headed for the schools office. When I got the the bottom of the stairs and hung a left I saw that they had beat me but Jeff�s girlfriend was bloody and he was holding her in a ,Bon Jovi  babe we�re gonna make it no matter what sorta pose, while our principal held a rag to her face. I the proceeded to my ag class to retell the story. Another magnificent moment of opioid fueled madness occurred about a month ago, the bell had rang and I was leaving my bio class when I turned to a friend who was walking to my left and then I heard it. Stomping, I turned around to see crackhead Jeff almost sprinting as he glided down the hall with a sex crazed look in his eyes he proceeded to catch up to us and smoothly glide on past us as he punched a locker with all his drug filled might and then scream�WOOOOOOO MAN� not once breaking stride or slowing down, as he rounded the corner headed for the bus, I turned to my friend and her only words were� can you spell heroine?� As we both busted out with laughter.  I sincerely hope you have enjoyed these small segments of crackhead Jeff�s adventures, and as he would put it �this is my world your all just living in it!�  And with that being said I will continue to post updates as my study of this new breed of drug baby turned drug addict at 16 continues. Stay tuned for a new update as soon as crackhead Jeff dose something badass again.

**The wolf and the infant**Maximus is a normal roman �puer� which means boy. He lives in a small city in France, back then controlled by the Romans, in the year 7. He is not poor, not rich either, he enjoys plays and gladiator fights.�Hey Max!� said Julianetta, one of the friends of Maximus, who is called Max by his friends. �Are you busy?� �no Julie, why?� asked max. �Well we were thinking we should do some exploring in the forest, since school is not open because of that slave revolt� �And who is we?� �Well of course Dartrix and Mentorix are coming but this time Leda is coming too, she finally decided that being lazy is getting you nowhere.� �That�s very good, I hope she likes being active� Max had been friends with Leda for a long time but she almost never left her house, she was even homeschooled because her parents could afford a teacher. �Let�s go then� Said Julie.Some time later after leading the guards away from the gate and sneaking out of the city they went into the forest. �Is it always so cold here?� Leda asked. �Yes, the leaves block the sun.� Dartrix said. �Can�t we go somewhere where there are less leaves then?� �It�s summer, all trees have leaves� �Can�t we go to a forest without trees then?� �Wow that homeschooling REALLY did you good huh!� Mentorix said sarcastically. �Leda, a forest is a place where a lot of trees are together so no we can�t go to a forest without trees.� Said Dartrix to Leda, who looked a bit ashamed. �Leda you can always go back.� Said Julie, probably worried that Leda would get sick or lose her fragile, homeschooled mind in a forest. �No! I was going to go with you guys and I am going to prove that I am not always lazy.� �Okay Leda that is very brave of you, if you have any questions just ask us� Max said.Later when they reached their familiar stream where they had gone so many times before they saw something surprising. �Hey Leda look this is our stream, we always come here to play Romulus and Remus� Max told her. �Ah that story, if there is something I know very well it is tha-� Said Leda before getting cut of by Julie saying �Silentium! There is something there!� They look over to where she was pointing and there, next to the river, was a female wolf, a �Lupa�.�That is weird we never saw wolves in this part of the forest� Said Mentorix confused. �She must have come here from another part of the forest, but why is she alone?� Then they suddenly heard vague crying. �Do you guys hear that too?� Asked Max. �Yes, weird�.� Remarked Julie listening even better. �It�s a crying child!� She realised with a shocked look on her face. �A baby?! That wolf is going to eat it! Where is the sound coming from?� Said Dartrix shocked. �I think it�s coming from the stream!� Max said. They all looked over at the stream and looked very confused when they saw the she-wolf licking a very young-looking human infant. �She is caring for it?!� Julie said confused. �Just like in the story of Romulus and Remus!� Noticed Leda. �Yes that seems to be the case only this time there is only one child.� Remarked Mentorix. �so what do we do now?� Asked Dartrix.�Let�s go and save it!� Max said immediately. �No! That would only get us killed� Said Dartrix, grabbing Max by the shoulder before he ran off. �What do we do then? We can�t let that baby stay here, it will surely not survive� Julie said worriedly. �Well we could lead it away with some rocks or something.� Thought Mentorix aloud. �No! We will go and ask the wolf if we can have the baby, we will tell her we will take good care of it. If this is really like the story we should be safe, just like the shepherd who found the twins back then.� Leda was looking very serious. �Have trust in the gods! A wolf caring for a human child must be a sign or something. Trust in the gods and it will all go as planned.� �Well there is nothing to say against that, good point Leda. Okay who is going to go ask?� Asked Max. �We are all is going to ask together!� Said Leda a bit irritated. �Okay. Okay. Calm down Leda, we will all go.� Said Julie, comforting Leda.So they all went down to the stream silently. �Hello Lupa, are you caring for that baby?� Asked Leda silently. The she-wolf turned around and looked at the kids. �Yes, but I am no human so I can not care for it too long.� The she-wolf said calmly. The kids all stepped back shocked except for Leda and Max, the only two who thought the plan would work. �Should we bring it to our city? We will take good care of it.� Max asked the she-wolf calmly. �Yes, thank you. That would be a burden of my shoulders, maybe then I can find my pack again.� She responded. �That explains why she is alone.� Whispered Julie to the two boys, a few meters away from Max and Leda. �A-Are you a god, or a messenger of the gods?� The question came from Mentorix who looked very worried. �No, I am something else entirely, I am connected to the gods though. I am sorry that I can not tell you what I am. By the way don�t be worried child I am harmless.� �Oh ok�..phew� Mentorix was calm now.After a few more questions Leda picked up the infant and they said goodbye to the she-wolf, who evaporated after she got out of sight. When they got out of the forest Julie asked: �Who is going to find someone for the baby? Leda? Your parents have the money and they have slaves.� �No, sorry my mother is already pregnant.� She responded. �I know someone who wants a child!� Max told them excitedly. �Okay so Max gets the child to bring them to someone. Is anybody against that?� Asked Julie. The others shook their heads. �Then it�s settled. Now let�s get back into our city!�When they got to the city the guards were still not there which they found weird but they didn�t question it. The kids said goodbye to each other and went their separate ways. When Max was in a small, dark alley the baby suddenly started talking in a very low voice: �You and your friends have done well.� Max almost dropped the baby but then he listened on. �The Lupa, this child and your whole forest adventure was all a test from the gods to see if you were worthy. I can not say for what, that is something you will figure out later in your life, but you guys are worthy, all 5 of you. Just to clarify you 5 never went into the forest it was all an illusion. That�s why the guards were still gone when you came back. This small child is also not real and will disappear soon.� �But I am touching this child, it can�t be an illusion if I�m touching it right?� �Illusions of touch and feeling are also possible young child and we are gods, we decide what�s real or not. You can or can�t tell your friends about this, this is in your hands, for my personal advice: I would say only tell it to that Leda girl, the others have too much to learn to know they are worthy, but you 2 were very brave.� �Thanks, I will listen to that advice.� �I shall now be going. Goodbye child my time is over.� �Goodbye.� Then the infant faded into nothingness.Later that same day still Max told Leda about what the infant said and she hugged him before being very proud of herself and him. They decided to not tell the others, at least not yet. Max had a great time speculating over what they were �worthy� for with Leda. They settled on peacekeepers. This is somewhat of a correct guess but they didn�t known that yet. He went to bed early that night because he was stunned by the things that had happened today. �What an amazing day!� Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night.**To be continued**

We all know that history repeats itself, but we usually meander along, unaware as it happens right in front of our very eyes. Even now, America doesn�t see what is happening. Gang culture and mainstream art are once again coinciding.What am I talking about, you ask? You may have heard about Cardi B�s and 6ix9ine�s affiliations with the infamous �Bloods� gang. Snitch9ine, as he is now known, has given into legal pressure and shown his and Cardi�s true selves. It seems that his rainbow hair was a loud foreshadowing of the fact that he could not hide his TRUE COLORS. Now that you know about this recent news, you are wondering one thing: �How is this an example of history repeating itself?� Well, just like 6ix9ine and Cardi, I�ve got a rhyme for you:Calm your tits and listen a bit.The origins of gang culture go largely undiscussed because of their shocking affiliation with classical orchestral music. Art and music historians do not want to replace the eloquent reputation of their glorified symphonies with a gang-centered stigma. They would rather leave Baroque and Romantic arts on their elevated pedestal than teach you what you should really know.What you should know is that Beethoven was a vicious gangster.Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a fine musical composer, and indeed he was one that we are all familiar with. Starting at the delicate young age of five years old, Mozart made waves in the world of music throughout his short life. He was only fourteen when Beethoven was born, and Beethoven looked up to him from the moment he was first capable of appreciating his music. Ludwig Van Beethoven was determined from age six onward to be the next great composer. He would be just like Mozart.How could such an aspiring, bright child become such a vicious gang leader? Well, one particular event darkened Beethoven�s heart, and caused him to see Mozart as someone to be defeated rather than someone to be looked up to.On one particularly chilly March night, when Beethoven was only eleven, and Mozart was twenty-five, Beethoven was finally able to see his idol perform in person. No more watching others simulate his work, this was his chance to see what it was like to truly watch a prodigy perform. The performance was astounding and sent tremors of excitement through the young boy�s body. He couldn�t just sit there and watch. After such a moving performance, he knew he must meet Mozart and speak to him for inspirational advice. This would be his musical epiphany.He snuck away from his parents and through the sitting crowd, crawling past the feet and the plumed dresses and knickers of the audience. Gradually he made his way toward the stage, and he began to search for the backstage entrance. He found the door and made his way to the back of the stage, remaining hidden until the curtains closed. Once the lights began to extinguish, he would make his way toward the piano, where he would let Mozart hear a Variation in C Minor that he had been working on for years. Surely Mozart would be proud.Once the curtain had completely closed, Mozart turned from his bowing and proceeded toward the stage exit where Beethoven had entered. It was his chance. He rushed to the piano and began to play, gently and fluidly. Mozart stopped at once and just stood there. He didn�t turn or even remove his arms from behind his back. Beethoven peered at him over his shoulder as he continued to play. What was happening? Perhaps he was enjoying this piece he had been working on?Suddenly, the mood worsened all at once. Mozart, young and famous man that he was, had quite an acute sense of an ego. The music that met his ears was no doubt the most beautiful new melody he had ever heard that was not written by himself, but he couldn�t have that. The crowd�s applause began to die out behind the curtain, and he knew they would hear this talented boy�s playing. His spotlight would be stolen. He turned around without a word and rushed the boy, jacket flailing behind him. A look of insanity clouded his eyes as he clutched Beethoven�s coat and threw him from the piano stool. He screamed, �How dare you touch my things?!� He seemed so relieved to see Beethoven lying on the floor in shock, away from the piano.�I-I�m sorry sir! I just wanted to sh-share my mus- my work with you,� stammered the frightened boy. He was so taken back by this sadistic reaction; this was surely not the same man he had looked up to for all these years.�Let me make this clear, child: your work lacks depth and thought. By your age, I was creating things that you couldn�t begin to comprehend. NEVER invite yourself into my space again, or I will see to it that you never watch me perform again!�Tears collected in young Beethoven�s eyes as he watched his unacknowledging idol turn and leave without an encouraging word. His entire view of music and the mind behind his favorite melodies had just been cut down and burned to ashes. He wanted to cry, but he knew he must make it back to his parents as they were probably about to notice his absence. He left the stage and scurried back to his family, but he would never let the events behind that stage leave his memory. He would never look up to that man again; in fact, he would do everything he could to steal that man�s spotlight.This would become his obsession.Later that year, Beethoven would release his 9 Variations in C Minor, which were quickly accepted by the rest of the world. It seemed to him that Mozart simply refused to acknowledge his brilliance out of mere envy. His music was not nearly as trite as Mozart would have him believe, and for this, his hatred of his former idol grew.Time passed and contentions grew. The two continued to write music, and either man refused to acknowledge the brilliance of the other. One�s refusal to acknowledge the other was fueled by envy, and the other�s was fueled by pure hatred. Two aggressive fires continued to grow in the hearts of these artistic geniuses, and often the fire could be heard in their melodies. Much of their success and passion was fueled by the feud between themselves, and ironically, these ugly thoughts and emotions created inspiration for beautiful music.By Beethoven�s eighteenth birthday, his obsession with ruining Mozart�s reputation outgrew his sense of morality. He knew that the only way to stop Mozart was to stop his very existence. He swore to God that he would kill Wolfgang, and he would waste no time in doing it. At the same time, Mozart�s physical constitution began to wane under the intense envy that plagued his mind day and night. He couldn�t realistically handle much more of this feud.Both men sought to kill, but one man would be a more natural killer.Of course, neither man could do it by their own hands. There were too many eyes and ears on them. They knew that they would need connections and other dark minds to collude with if they were to take out the other. Mozart and Beethoven both began secretly networking, trying to find ways to set up an unforeseeable assassination. They both developed large lists of contacts and connections and began to set things in motion.They had started down a path with no return. Beethoven, with his German heritage, decided he should choose a name for his group of contacts that walked this treacherous path with him. He began pondering names for his group, at first considering simply using the name �path,� which, in German, translates to none other than �gang.� He then realized that coincidentally, the very man he desired to assassinate had this very word in his own name. Wolfgang. Path of the Wolf.Beethoven was now officially the leader of the world�s first gang: the Wolf Gang.At first, the attacks were more conservative, as the desire to kill hadn�t taken either of them over completely. Beethoven initiated a few failed attempts to maim Mozart�s hands, and Mozart launched a nearly successful attempt to take Beethoven�s hearing, an attempt that would affect Beethoven for the rest of his life. Alas, neither of them found enough success to suffice their envy and hatred, and that is when the attempts to kill went into full swing.After three years, things became very tense and neither man traveled without someone to keep him protected. Beethoven was now twenty-one and had sustained damage to his ears when one of Mozart�s men managed to sneak into his window and hold him down while striking his ears repeatedly. Mozart felt as though he were winning the battle because of Beethoven�s lack of successful attempts in comparison to his, but in reality, his health was taking an even worse toll just because of the way his envy ate away at him. He was sickly, and eventually became entirely ill. The illness was nothing out of the ordinary, but it had yet to be diagnosed when his doctor handed him a drink of water to keep him hydrated. The water was slightly bitter, and Mozart assumed that it was a bit of medicine that his doctor had mixed in. He finished the water and set his cup at his bedside. His doctor returned to retrieve it, and as he leaned over to pick it up, he whispered into Mozart�s ear, �The Path ends here.�Checkmate.Beethoven had finally placed a pawn in the critical spot that needed to be filled. The timing was perfect on that December night near the end of 1791. That was the end of Mozart. Cause of death? Traditional history books make it vague to this day, but the papers released only a week after his death correctly claimed that he was poisoned.Nearly twenty years later, Beethoven remembered the pledge he made to God: that he would kill Mozart. He wanted to write a symphony, dark�yet somehow whimsical, to commemorate the oath he kept on that day. He didn�t know if he would ever release the piece, but he knew he wanted to compose it as he reminisced on his oath to kill Mozart. So on April 27th, 1811, Beethoven finished Fur Elise.He never did release this piece for himself, perhaps out of fear that someone would understand its meaning, but it was eventually discovered in 1867, over 40 years after his death. Historians remain puzzled to this day: why did Beethoven give this symphony such a succinct and specific title as opposed to his normal methodology of giving technical names to his music? To add to the confusion, �Fur Elise� literally translates to �For Elise,� but no one seems to know who Elise is. Well, no one except for me. Further translation uncovers the meaning of the name �Elise.�*Pledged to God.*He wrote this song in commemoration of the pledge he made to God: to kill Mozart.Beethoven remained unhappy after Mozart�s assassination. His loss of hearing and the sudden realization of his years-long obsession left him feeling empty and hopeless. All he could do was slave over his music and spend his nights alone. He began to drink heavily and retained this habit until he died in 1827 to Cirrhosis of the liver.Gang culture faded out of the music scene slowly but eventually after his death, but as we discussed, history repeats itself. Keep your eyes on our rainbow-haired friend and the other gang-affiliated lady he snitched on. The wheels of history keep turning, and what goes around eventually comes back around.

I (16M) work at a popular restaurant in a smallish town. At the restaurant, we rent out our ballroom to people that want to do events, usually a high-school reunion or band playing etc. Today though, it was rented out by a symphony and they planned to play for a large group of elderly people. In the ballroom there is a small bar run by a single bartender that people can order drinks at. For most of the night, I was working in the main restaurant, bussing plates and bringing people water. The restaurant bartender got a call from the ballroom bar tender and said that they needed help in the ballroom with something. This is generally a regular thing, needing some extra help, and i figured it was just some light glass bussing. I was awfully wrong. After walking down to the ballroom I was met by a volunteer that was working for the symphony and they told me that there was a mess over by the trash can. We walked over there and behind the trash can was a large pile of BLACK diarrhea with a trail of shit drops all of the way to the women�s bathroom where the person had dropped another pile of diarrhea right on the ground next to the toilet. They asked me to clean it all up and didn�t give me supplies. I went back to the restaurant and got some gloves, a trash bag, and and entire roll of paper towels. After cleaning the women�s bathroom of shit, the symphony began to play and I was forced to walk out there while they were playing and with the loud ass trash bag and paper towels, clean the pile of shit by the trash can. I was scared, embarrassed, angry and wanted to vomit.  Worst day of my life 0/10 would not recommend cleaning up old people diarrhea.

This is one of those things that stay with you for the rest of your life. I will certainly never forget it, and I don't think the girl will either.It was back in the summer of 2017. I was living with my friend while I searched for my own place, and I worked at a restaurant which naturally meant I was working late hours on weekends.My friend's place was about half an hour away from my workplace if you took the subway, but there were also buses going out there, but they went less frequently and took a longer time.I got off work at 10 pm that night, and nothing out of the ordinary happened. I took the train and everything was cool ... until I realized outside the apartment door that I'd forgotten the key in my locker at work, and my friend had gone away for the entire weekend.While cursing myself, I started looking for trains and buses to take me back to the city, and while there was a train going there, there were no more going back. My only chance was the last bus for the night which would depart from the central station 15 minutes after I'd arrived back in the city.(Important note: it takes about 10 minutes to walk from my workplace to the central station at a normal pace, so it was safe to say I was in a hurry.)It was my only chance, but I had to take it. There were no extra keys to get a hold on.So, I did it.I went back to work, found the key, and then started power walking, almost running toward the central station.Since it was the weekend, I passed a lot of bars pumping loud music and there were drunk people everywhere.Not far from the station, I turned onto a street that I hoped would spare me time. It was empty apart from a young girl walking by herself a few yards ahead of me.I am still stressing and walking as fast as I can without running when I realize a guy is following me. He's very close, and sniffing my hair.Normally, I'd be very uncomfortable, but the stress had raised the adrenaline in my body and I quickly became irritated instead. I turned around and gave the guy the death glare of glares. Maybe he understood I was not to be tampered with at that moment 'cause I'd surely fight back since I was too stressed to feel fear, but he backed off with his hands up in a surrender.I thought he'd given up, and I continued my power walk. I was right next to the younger girl at that point and when I looked in her direction, I saw the guy had chosen his new target.He was up right behind her, touching her hair and whispering in her ear, and she clearly didn't like it. She was squirming and tried to walk away, but she was too scared to say no (lots of girls don't because we fear it will trigger the guy to do worse)I'd had enough of the dude, and I don't know if it was instinct or the adrenaline, but I didn't think or hesitate as I stomped up to them and aggressively shoved him away from the girl. He was bigger than me so the fact that I was able to do it should paint you a picture of how angry I was. I pointed at his face."Get the fuck away from her. She doesn't want you to touch her!" I yelled at him, and maybe my words echoing loudly around the empty street made him worry he'd get caught or something, but he retreated. I didn't take my eyes away from him until he had disappeared around the corner of a side street going the opposite direction of where the girl was headed.Remember, during all of this, I'm still stressing to catch my bus, but I looked at the girl anyway."Are you okay?"She nodded and gave me the most grateful expression I'd ever seen and she silently thanked me.We parted after that, and I miraculously managed to get to my bus in time.Wherever this girl is now, I still think of her to this day and hope she's really okay. Who knows what would have happened if my adrenaline hadn't been pumping!

One night, my grandfather was in his car and some guy got in and pulled out a gun. He held him at gunpoint and told him to drive to the bank. My grandfather had no choice but to do so, so he went and dropped him off at the bank.Then he drove home. When he got there, he went inside and told my grandmother what had happened. He was expecting her to be worried or ask him if he�s okay, but the first thing she says is...�Oh, Wes, you didn�t let him smoke in the car, did you?�

I was about two or three at the time so I don�t remember anything but my brother told me that once he was in the playground with his friend. This friend asked him if he wanted to see something cool and then continued to pull down his trousers. My brother thought he knew what was gonna happen (that they�d end up getting naked) until this kid pulled down his underwear to reveal another pair of underpants. He kept pulling them down, he had multiple pairs on, until he reached the last one. My brother was amazed and thought it was cool and funny, so his dumb ass decided that, for the next fortnight, that he wouldn�t take off underwear but just put pairs on. He was walking home with our mum when he asked her if she wanted to see something cool. He did what his friend did and repeatedly pulled down his many pairs of pants until he only had one left. Keep in mind that this was in the middle of the street, a fairly busy street.She was obviously not happy. She did not think it was amazing or cool.

A long time ago, I used to be an alcoholic. I would drift from city to city, from bar to bar. My only living family member within a 200-mile radius was my mother I had back in my home town. She was in a home; my sister put her there. I could�ve gone and visited her, but I just didn�t care enough, I guess. The taste of booze was more important to me.I went to this one bar one time, way in the outskirts of anywhere. It was a grungy/goth sort of bar, so everyone wore some kind of strange leather. Pretty common for the area. To the outside world, it was where all the weirdo outcasts lurked � where no one in their right mind would wanna hang. To me, it was one of the last bars I hadn�t been kicked out of yet. I used that to my full potential.Once I stepped in there the first time that night, I went straight to the bar and downed a couple. I looked around. Each person was weirder than the next. Most of them were staring at me like I was an unwelcome martian; I wasn�t wearing very proper attire for the bar: a stained flannel and a dirty pair of brown pants. I was a lumberjack in a sea of misfits (if that paints the picture).The drinking bar at which I now sat was the direct center of the place, which I thought was pretty cool. It was like the whole joint had a heart. It was also circular, so you could see the people to the side and across from you in a wheel.I guess that�s when I saw Lydia for the first time. She was at 2 o�clock in the wheel, position-wise. She was the only other lady in this joint that wasn�t covered head to toe in leather (or not even covered at all). She sat alone, looking around at the strange environment like I was. I guess I saw a certain purity emitting from her.Her hair was like an electric blue, clipped into a pixie cut.I wasn�t shitfaced yet, but I had enough confidence to wander over. So I did. I introduced myself, and so did she, but by her hesitance and quietness, I could tell she was an introvert. I asked her if she was here with anyone. She said she wasn�t. We talked for the next hour. She never opened up once. But I wasn�t giving up. She was just too damn beautiful.I eventually asked her if she wanted to take a walk. She looked a little concerned (which I suppose I can understand), and even though I didn�t expect her to, she went along with me anyway. We left the place and went down the sidewalk. Street was well-lit, and plenty of people were out on their porches, smoking joints. I made sure we stayed in that general facility, just so she didn�t get uncomfortable.In the brightness of that sector, that�s when I noticed the bruise on her neck. Clearly a handprint. I didn�t ask her about it, but I could tell there might be a reason she was so quiet.She led me to a small apartment complex. She unlocked the door, took me up the stairs, and let me into her room. It was miniature, and very cluttered. There were clothes strewn about, and actually a shattered coffee pot on the floor.We sat on her bed and started talking. I could tell she may have had a drink too many at the bar. She was a little loopy. She started talking about this guy she lived with. I asked her if it was her husband. She said: �Not to me, he�s not.� I didn�t really know what to think about that.About five minutes later, she stuck her tongue down my throat. I guess she thought it was the right moment, but it completely was not. I pushed her off me. Not a moment later, she was sobbing on the bed. I wasn�t prepared for a situation like this. Who could be?Only thing I thought to do was embrace her, and so I did. We held each other for about half-an-hour.Soon, her sobbing subsided. She started whispering to me about her loneliness, and how long it�s been since she�s felt safe and loved. How the man she�s living with is not a real man. She was cryptic, but I understood.Then a few moments later, she felt asleep on me. I lied her down on the bed. I hate to admit it, but I watched her there for a long time. She looked so innocent. Then I looked around at the trash hole around her. There was no correlation. I got the impression that being in this place wasn�t her choice.I didn�t leave the apartment that night. I guess I just got the hunch that at any moment, her �lover� could come through that door and put another handprint on her body.She slept for about three hours. I walked around the apartment. I won�t lie about that. I walked over to the broken coffee pot. Seems like it was tossed right at the fridge, then crashed to the floor. I could only imagine what things happened in this home.I found a photo album on one of the shelves. I opened it and flipped through it. It was like a story. It began with two teenagers. A boy and a girl, the girl being Lydia (at this time, a brunette). They grew up together. They didn�t go anywhere without each other. And one day, they got married.A few years later, a baby entered their albums. They loved that baby everyday, and nothing could change that. That baby evolved into a 5-year-old kid through the pages. He went through preschool, played on the baseball team, and even built a treehouse with his old man.But then the kid stopped appearing in the book, and the man and the wife started looking less cheerful. Soon, you could see bruises on the woman. Arms, legs. One time, she turned up with a black eye. After a while, the woman buzzed her hair off and dyed it electric blue. She seemed almost proud of it. Like it would somehow soothe her circumstances.Then the photo book ended. Things were clear.I put the book down where I found it and sat on the bed. She woke up a little while later. She was sober, and asked me what had happened between us. I said that nothing had. She asked if she told me anything. I told her no. But something in my voice confirmed that she had.She told me that she didn�t care. That at least someone finally knew. I told her she could trust me, and she could. We talked for another hour about life, actions, and consequences. She told me that her husband was a drifter (like me), and that he�d leave for days at a time and explore bars and get shit-faced. I won�t lie; in that moment, something hit me square in the conscious.She eventually came out to me about everything. I promised myself I would never tell anyone what she told me. And you�re not getting it out of me here. Only way in Hell I�d tell a soul is if they had a gun in my mouth, and even then I�d hold back.We figured it was time for me to leave. She led me outside on the sidewalk. We shook hands. I asked her if she was going to be okay. She said: � A couple months ago, I would�ve said absolutely not. But now, today, this very night...I think I�ve got a chance.� That�s what always stuck with me the most.Then I began to walk off. I looked behind me once I reached the end of the sidewalk. She was still watching me. Then she smiled. She looked like an angel in the moonlight. I smiled, too. Then I left. I never saw Lydia again.The first thing I did the next morning was burn all my alcohol in the fire pit behind my house and visit my dying mother. The whole time, I was thinking of that girl with the electric blue hair. She�s never left my memory.

Before you start ( this is a kinda long story so if you dont like those just skip trough )I live in lebanon my whole life and its a amazing country . A lot of people think that it is just a desert but we are quite the opposite.We have a lot of forests and small parks and so on , wish is related to my story .Yesterday was a really hot day the kind where u just want to sleep all day . Well during that day a fire was seen in a small mountain village and it was spreading fast and quick and its still going on till today .Every body fought it was a natural event because of high winds and blazing sun and might have bin caused from a piece of glass reflecting the sun onto a dead lief or tree trunk . It seemed like a good excuse but i didnt really bought it . The fire was huge the biggest lebanon has ever seen , normally natural fires are rare and easy to handle but this one was spreading fast burning houses electrical cords , cars leaving a trail of dust behind it . I wasn�t the only one thinking that way , people fought it was natural and people fought it was planned .I fought it was planned , and my point was proven today . Many other fires appeared around small villages where the trees aren�t that close to each other at all but still spread a lot .Here we were desperate and just hoping for our army and fire men will handle it . Until a sudden news broadcast happened telling us that it appeared that there is sudden rain clouds heading our way . It was huge news that no one saw coming and truly a miracle . The weather didn�t predict rain for a few weeks and especially for today it was a sudden change no one expected. When clouds formed and there was just high winds it was clear and proven that a lot of Syrians who we welcomed for years and years , and they took a lot of jobs since they ask for less money  wish led to many companies closing many lebanese young men without jobs traveling to other countries for a job . We did not make a huge deal of it since some are very handy and friendly . But now a lot of Syrian men where arrested for carrying Molotovs ( a molotov is a bottle containing any flammable liquid mostly gad and is closed off with a small piece of closing or tissue soaked in flammable liquids ) . One of the first people arrested was behind my house , where their is a big un accessible forest . Some locals saw a glowing red dot moving and found it was smoke and directly called the fire station who was really close by . When the fire men arrived they found a Syrian trying to burn the forrest using liters cigarets Molotovs .... after that a lot where caught and some are still out there . For now word hasn�t really gon fully out but we are trying to warn as much as we can .It was one of the scariest moments of my life since a previous forest behind our house was burnt down during  my child hood ( i was 5 , now im 18 ) it scared me because its a commonly used forest for me and my neighbors , building tents and camp fires those where the days . It was burnt for building a compound and the other forest I mentioned before was behind it connecting all around both sides of our house .Thank you for reading this hope you enjoyed my story , if u have any question dont be afraid to ask me in the comments i�ll reply asap .

A part of me died on August 21, 2019.I used to be a heavy drinker and drug user. I met my boyfriend through a mutual friend and he happened to be a drug dealer. There's a lot of bias I'm sure about drug dealers but let me just tell you that, it doesn't make a person evil. They may be making wrong decisions but it doesn't define a person. My boyfriend, aside from selling drugs, was an amazing person. He was willing to do anything for his friends and he'd help out anyone who was going through a tough time. He was selfless, ambitious, trustworthy, and someone who could make everyone who was in the same room as him laugh and smile. He was 7 years older than me and I think that's what made me so attracted to him, because he wasn't ignorant or immature as the guys I was always surrounded by. My family was worried about the age difference but age is really just a number, right? We met towards the end of May and we were just hooking up. I had a bad reputation and I didn't really respect myself or the guys I slept with but my boyfriend change all that for me. In the beginning, it was a little rough as I found out that he would only bring girls over to his house once and his roommates would never see the same girl twice. He was different with me though. He invited me over again and I went over to his house as soon as I could find a ride. He lived about 45 minutes away from where I lived but all his friends were in the town I lived in so he was there often at this apartment complex a bunch of us hung out at. It was the cheapest apartment complex in that town as it was aimed towards college students. One night, when I had to go back to my town, he told me to wait because he wanted to walk me out. This surprised all of his roommates, because apparently he never walks the girls he invites out. I felt really special and excited. The next time I went over to his house, I ended up just moving in. I slept with him in his room and it felt like we were dating and I really wanted to make it official. He, on the other hand, wasn't looking to be in a relationship and he also felt that he couldn't trust me because of my past. I didn't blame though because I understood why he felt insecure about dating me and he also had really bad trust issues from his last relationship. I told him that I would prove to him that he can trust me and I did. He told me that we don't need labels and that all that matters is that he knows I'm his and I know that he's mine. A few days later though, we made it official because I wanted the labels and I wanted to openly call him my boyfriend. He was my first boyfriend and my first love. A few weeks later, while we were having sex, he asked me if I loved him and I told him, "I love you" and I asked him the same question and he answered the same. It was one of the happiest moments of my life. For the next two months, while I lived with him, his roommates which consisted of a mother of two little girls, her younger brothers aged 15 and 18, my boyfriend's friend, and a huge pit bull, it was truly the happiest times of my life. We were a huge family full of laughter and happiness. My boyfriend loved to spoil me but I never really let him spoil me as much as he wanted. The only thing I really let him buy me was food, one pair of pants, and a bathing suit. He bought me the things I liked when he'd go out to do business on rare occasions that I didn't go with him. Those were some of my favorite moments with him, our car rides together, just us two. We'd talk and listen to music, just bonding. Those happy days came to an end eventually when the lease was up on their house. My boyfriend's roommate couldn't handle the rent anymore and decided to move back to their home state. My boyfriend was frantically trying to look for another place to rent in the town his friends were but the only choice he had was the apartment complex we both didn't like but had the cheapest rent. Fast forward to the night of August 21, 2019, my boyfriend and I overdosed on Xanax that was laced with fentanyl. An ambulance was called at around 4 in the morning. It was already too late for him... and my heartbeat was at 6 bpm so they had to give me an adrenaline shot 5 times before my stats were stabilized. I had blacked out from the Xanax so I didn't remember that night at all leading up to us being unconscious. I remember waking up in the hospital confused and scared. I didn't know what was going or what happened that led me to be in the hospital. I remember seeing my mom, my brother, and his fiancee then the doctors telling me that... my boyfriend was dead. He was gone. That he had overdosed on fentanyl, a drug he didn't want any part of because he knew the dangers. Just like that, the man I love with all of my very being was gone. I don't remember much after that, apparently I was very violent with the doctors and nurses. I remember waking a few times for a couple minutes before I'd start crying and screaming for my boyfriend then falling back asleep. Being in the hospital that night was torture because they put me on some kind of medication that made me forget, I would continuously ask where my boyfriend was, and the nurse who was watching me would continuously tell me he was dead. I kept hearing that over and over again and again. I was in a dark place after that. I couldn't hear anything or see anything. I was numb. After I got discharged the next day, yes I was in the hospital for one night, the second I got home, I went straight to my room, and I tried to kill myself by overdosing on Advil PM. I woke up again in the hospital. I was angry that, yet again, I was saved. Why did my boyfriend die while I got to live... twice? It was unfair. I got sent to a mental institution as soon as I was discharged from the hospital. The first two days were awful but then I woke up at around 5 am on the third day and I asked for a journal to write in. I wrote to my boyfriend as I watched the sunrise. It helped me spill out all the feelings that were building up inside me. The psychiatrist there diagnosed me as majorly depressed and tried to prescribe me antidepressants but I didn't want to take them. I was afraid to take any type of drugs. I was traumatized you could say. I had no cravings or need to take the drugs I used to because I was afraid. I was there for 6 days. After I got discharged, I was afraid to be in the real world again. I felt like I was in a box when I was at the institution, away from the world. I was scared to be out in a world where my boyfriend was no longer there. I went from seeing him everyday when I woke up and him being the last thing I see before I slept to nothing so suddenly. It was real shock and it still is, 53 days after his death. I'm still having a hard time believing he's really gone. A few weeks after I was discharged, I noticed that I hadn't gotten my period. Of course with the overdose and the grief, it was because of the stress otherwise the hospital would've let me know of anything else from my blood work. I waited and I stressed more and more about it so I finally decided to take a pregnancy test. I bought two and as soon as I got home, I took one. It came out undetected so I planned to take the other one in the morning and I did. It came out positive. I searched up false positives and although it was rare, I thought maybe that's it. I bought another pregnancy test the next day and that came out positive as well. I was pregnant with my deceased boyfriend's child. I was shocked but happy because my boyfriend had left behind a piece of him but I was also scared to have a child without him. I made an appointment with an OB and they told me I was 5 weeks pregnant. I saw the ultrasound and how fast my baby's heartbeat was. It was so beautiful but I was devastated because this baby will never get the chance to meet it's amazing father. My boyfriend will never get the chance to get married, to have children, or to grow old. I'll never get the chance to tell him I'm pregnant, to have him help me put on my shoes when I get big, marry him, raise our child together, and all the little things in life. All of that was taken away from us by a stupid kid who gave my boyfriend fentanyl and lied about it. My boyfriend would still be alive if it weren't for the fentanyl. I know we made the choices and took the risks but it hurts that the person who gave him laced Xanax was someone we knew. Why was my boyfriend the one who had to lose his life? Why did they do something so evil and take him away from so many people who loved him? Why did they have to lie about the fentanyl? The police and the detective on this case are treating his death as homicide. There's an ongoing investigation and hopefully the people who are responsible for my boyfriend's death will feel remorse for taking the man I love away from me, his friends, family, and our baby. It's truly a miracle baby. My due date is 4 days after my boyfriend's birthday. He was a light that shined bright in the lives of everyone who knew him. He was one of a kind and special. I was truly blessed to have had him in my life. I miss you so much and just like how you used to say this to me, I love you to death. L.L.L.L.I am sharing this story because I want to spread awareness. Drugs are not worth the lives of the people you love. I let drugs blind me into thinking that I had it under control and that I needed it to have fun but you don't. You never know what the future holds, all you can do is change to prevent such tragedies from happening again. Please don't take any pills that weren't prescribed to you and please don't risk your life or the lives of others with drugs you don't need. This is an epidemic. Fentanyl is being used to lace all types of drugs. Hundreds of people are dying from overdosing on fentanyl. Please help spread awareness and help those you know who have a problem. Even if you don't believe that you have a problem, you can't guarantee that every batch of drugs you get are going to be clean or safe. Losing a loved one is like a losing a part of yourself. A part of me died that night with my boyfriend. I am still struggling with grief and anguish and I wouldn't want this upon anyone.  You can prevent it, you have the power to change. Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I hope endless happiness for all of you.

Back in 1986, I was working as an assistant editor and sound recordist for a small film company in London. I had been working in theatre as well up to that time�film during the day and in the evenings working as a showman at one of the big West End theatres, but had recently decided to stop working in theatre and concentrate on the film side: the pay was a lot better too and it was a huge opportunity to expand my skillset.We were currently engaged on working on a documentary for British Aerospace. One particular segment involved helicopters. Our director thought it would be a nice idea to start the segment off with our presenter drifting about the sea in a rubber dinghy and staging a �rescue� with a helicopter. A few letters and phone calls later, we had secured the co-operation of both the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the Royal Navy for this little jaunt.So, one day in early October, we pile onto a train and travel down from London to Falmouth. We spent a very pleasant evening in the hotel and the next morning after breakfast, took a couple of taxis down to the lifeboat station with our gear, whilst our second unit cameraman (who was also the editor) took off for the Royal Naval Air Station at Culdrose where he would be shooting from inside the helicopter (for the curious, an HAR5 Sea King).Getting to the harbour, we find the RNLI lifeboat already moored up on the quayside, so we humped our kit aboard and prepared to set sail. Also on board were a couple of photographers�this becomes important later. The day was rather overcast but not too bad for the time of year. It was going to take about half an hour to reach our appointed rendezvous with the Sea King so we spent some time admiring the view which, by the time you got out of sight of land, was not particularly interesting.About ten minutes before we were due to meet up with the helicopter, I went below decks to assemble my kit: trusty Nagra 4S recorder, a long-range rifle mic and a radio mic for our presenter. As I came back on deck, I started to feel rather queasy. Now I�ve been on quite a few vessels in my time, large and small, and I have never been seasick before, so this was a new�and very unwelcome�sensation. No sooner had I got the presenter hooked up with his radio mic than I had to drop all my kit on the deck and run over to the side, where I promptly lost the rather fine breakfast I had consumed earlier.There�s also a curious aspect to being seasick: unlike being sick when one has overindulged in the fruits of Bacchus�commonly spent talking to God on the Great White Telephone�and which after evacuating said fruits one usually feels better, seasickness just� doesn�t�stop!By now, breakfast had long been consigned to the depths of the Atlantic, and my stomach had shrunk to the size of a walnut�and still the intense nausea didn�t cease. In the midst of this, the Sea King arrives and we have to get to work. Overboard go our presenter and the cameraman into the dinghy and we have to start shooting. There is no way we can abort the shoot, despite my debilitating condition: we only have an hour with the helicopter and the costs involved in a reshoot would have been horrendous, so I�m forced to struggle on despite feeling like I�d just gone six rounds with Mike Tyson.It took about forty minutes to get the shots we needed in the can and all through the shoot the nausea is unrelenting, which makes concentrating on the job in hand bloody nigh-on impossible. Our presenter is eventually �rescued� and afterwards both he and the second unit cameraman were winched back aboard the lifeboat.The director calls a wrap, the Sea King disappears over the horizon and I can finally allow myself to wallow in abject misery without distraction, but safe in the knowledge that having finished, we were now on our way back to Falmouth.No!A few moments later, the crew put two of their inflatables over the side and the lifeboat then proceeds to pull a series of tight high-speed S-turns which created a large wake over which the two inflatables could skip over. Now we understood the true purpose of the photographers: as well as shooting stills of our little escapade, they were also shooting some publicity stills for the RNLI.These lifeboats are designed to be self-righting, which makes them ride quite high in the water. This also makes them rather prone to rolling and pitching about. Bear in mind that I had now been dry-heaving for nearly three hours and this movement merely served to further exacerbate the sensation. Please, shoot me *now!*Eventually, after what seemed like an eternity, the photographers got their shots, the inflatables were retrieved and we finally turned northwards back to the harbour. With virtually every muscle aching from the ever-present intestinal outrage, I elected to go forward and lie on the roof of the cockpit, thus placing myself out of view from the rest of the crew, knowing that within half an hour my wretchedness would be over.Again, no!We have now reached the extracting-the-urine stage!!Suddenly, I heard the cry of �man overboard�, and the lifeboat heeled violently to port. From my position, I could heard my crew in panic, obviously thinking that I had thrown myself off the bow in an attempt to end my suffering. Clambering off the cockpit, I went down to the stern to see what the commotion was. The look of sheer relief in my crew�s faces was as surprising as it was gratifying. We were then informed that this was common practice aboard lifeboats; on what was effectively a training voyage for the lifeboat crew, one member would toss a lifebelt off the side at random and they would then practice retrieving it.Finally(!), we headed back to Falmouth. Still feeling like death warmed up, I retook my station on the cockpit roof to await our arrival back at port. Here�s where it gets very weird: as we crossed the entrance to the harbour, I went from feeling as sick as a parrot to feeling completely fine within the space of literally two seconds. I later surmised that my nausea had been triggered by the low-frequency Atlantic swell which, by virtue of the seafloor rising quite sharply at the harbour entrance, got completely damped out. I remember getting onto the quayside, falling down on my hands and knees, and kissing the ground so happy was I at the relief from the torment of the last four hours,The journey back to London was uneventful, except for the fact that I was so hungry I ate two complete meals in the train�s restaurant car, much to the amusement of my compatriots.Epilogue: we got the rush prints back from the lab the following day. When we reviewed the material from the second unit, the one that had been in the helicopter, we found that the cameraman had filmed the initial approach to the lifeboat. Clearly visible was the crew standing at the stern whilst yours truly could be seen halfway up the port side heaving his guts out. I informed both director and editor that if they used that shot in the final film, I would stitch them up a treat and I�d take them both off my Christmas card list!

I, uhh, needed to shit.So I opened the back sliding door and found the bathroom. I pulled my pants down, plopped my ass down on the seat and shitted.I flushed the toilet, but forgot to wash my hands.Oh well.Then it hit me... it wasn't even my fucking house!!!

So, this happened about 8-9 years ago, during the recession. We just moved to Florida, and after leaving our mold infested apartment, we were moving from motel to motel looking for a permanent place to live. After moving around the county a lot, we end up moving into this one motel that was across from our future townhome. Anyways, we were kinda down on our luck, we didn�t have much, my parents needed work, and we lost one of our cars earlier that year. School was also a hassle because I was enrolled in pre-k in a school that was far away from us, and my dad�s volkswagen was really beaten up (it broke down on the interstate and a county sheriff had to drive us to our motel.)So one morning, I asked my Dad if I could have a pop tart for breakfast, and I get one. It didn�t fill me up, and being a little kid, I asked him if I could get another one, since I couldn�t reach it on my own. At that moment, I think something inside of him snaps, as he gave me this look and just walks to the bathroom. He just takes a shit with the door open, and calls me over. Once he gets up, he tells me to look at the massive shit he just took and said,� look son! theirs your pop tart. Tasty, right?� I was confused as to why he did this, and he looked as if he actually wanted me to eat it. I knew I wasn�t getting my pop tart.Fast forward to today, I am living a decent life, in a nice suburb of West Palm Beach, and the pop tart story is an inside joke between me and my friend group. My Mom knows, but she won�t tell, and my Dad has all but forgotten about it. Just take my advice and don�t ask for seconds from angry parents.Thank you, and I hope you enjoyed my story.

So I am now 22 I�ve been having really weird dreams since I was a child.. (like 9 years old) the dreams  consisted of my past my future and what is happening in my life now.. I knew that I was going to have a child at 21 when I was 10 and what her name was and everything and all.. I knew what my first apartment looked like down to the Spackle above the electrical socket in the living room where they obviously forgot to paint and that�s just one of the things that happened I remember telling my dad to be careful in his green van on the back roads he  responded with son we don�t have a green van, two years later he got into a major  accident in his green van that he bought three months prior after that day he was weirded out by me I don�t know but it creeps me out really bad on how this happens is this normal what exactly is this?

So, when I was young, probably around the age of 4-5, I loooooooved watching iCarly. But, ya know, kids are kids. I was watching one of their shows on our TV because yeah, but being around that age I was like, "Woooow, I wanna be just like them!" I was just sitting there, watching. It went to a certain part where it was that backstage thing and they recorded to their channel, and so I was really looking forward to seeing the part. Once they started, they had like, raisins, and stuck them up their nose. Being a child, I had toys, some with no beads, and some with beads. So, I just took the beads and said, "Oh! I'm gonna be just like them and stick these big beads in my nose and totally not get them stuck!"So, I did so. Stick them right up my tiny nose. I made a huuuuuuge mistake, though. I tried to shoot them out of my nose, and when I did, only one fell out. The other stuck in my nose. I remember going to the ER to get the stuck bead removed, but yeah. Children, am I right?

A friend went to random girls saying "You make my pencil hard."  Fun moments.

I posted this on another community. But I discovered reddit a few days ago, so I decided to post this story on another community because I listened to all advice that was given to me, and I actually enjoyed talking to everyone. This is going to be a lengthy post. I will not mention anyone's name for obvious reasons. I'm coming home after a long mentally painful 7 month disaster. I wish i can say what i did, but i can't. What i can say is that, those 7 months were filled with nightmare, painful mental issues, and the biggest heartbreak i thought i would ever feel at the time. What i can say is that after act that we had to do was so severe, we were defeated mentally from guilt. My teammate, (which i considered my brother) took out his weapon and killed himself right in front of me. After i begged him not to, he stated he has no family, nothing to come back to.. and living with this guilt was only going to kill him. He wanted to end the pain right then and there. I begged for him not to, that he was my brother... that i was his family, but it wasn't enough. parts of his brains in my face. My ears ringing.. others rushing in. My mind blank. I couldn't sleep nor eat. My kids calling me on skype and i let it ring as i look at the skype screen but actually thinking about my brother. I took long sessions talking to a professional. I was sent home. before i get to it all, i was told that military wives are the biggest snakes. they take you for granted, and never take your eyes off of them. So basically took their advice and wanted to prove everyone wrong. I didn't say when i was coming, but i had huge vacation plans to make up for it. i was told not to let her know when i'll coming back home. I;;ve been with my wife for 5 yrs. 4 together, 1 married. a set of twins, 2 girls girls at age of 2 at the time. I get driven home, I see my car, my beautiful home, but what mattered is hugging my family after 7 months of not seeing them. i go in, no one is there. I checked the pool, no one. I go closer to my room, i hear moaning. I go closer, and my door is locked. That is my wife moaning. The door is locked but i have a door that scans my finger print, or my wife's. i opened the door and i see my wife bent over, the other guy was none other than my best friend, the best man of the wedding. I grew up with this guy. I met him when i was 6, he was 5. Since 1st grade. This was my brother. my mind blanked. The next thing i heard is "YOU'RE GOING TO KILL HIM!!!! sTOOOOOOP! PLEASE STOOOOOOP!" My wife pushing my back, holding onto me crying and scared. All i felt was an adrenaline. My heart beating like i finished running a marathon, hands trembling. I forgot where i was until i looked down. What i saw was a naked woman cring holding, telling me she's sorry, and a naked man leaking blood intensively. I start crying cuz i almost killed my brother. I didn't mean actually hurt him. I asked if i hurt her, and she said no. I start spazzing out on her. "**do you know what I had to go through!! ALL THOSE POEPLE! aLL THIS FIGHTING!?! AND FOR WHAT? TO COME BACK HOEM TO SEE YOU WITH HIM!!!! 7 MONTHS OF NIGHTMARES, DEPRESSION, HATE, AND PARANOIA?!** While i'm screaming at her... i'm breaking everything. My bed, the frames, the dresser, the t.v, the door, i punched the wall and place about 15 holes. I flipped the bed over... I destroyed the room pretty much. cops were called by neighbors. Cops found me sitting in a corner with a blanked mind. EMT came picked both up and brought to the hospital. they patched my hands... as for him, a broken nose, broken arm, dislocated shoulder, etc. I couldn't feel nothing. no anger, no sadness, no guilt, nothing. My wife crying on her knees begging for forgiveness. As i was looking at her, i was thinking about my brother. How i couldn't save him from himself. what kind of a failure am i? Coming home to this woman was my karma. I instantly heard the footsteps of my girls. As soon as they saw me, i heard "DADDY!!" They climb on the bed and start hugging me. I instantly start crying. I held them and asked her if they're mine. Since moment they were born, they did not look like me. I shrugged this off cuz i always thought i don't look like my father but i still have his weird black nipple on the left and lighter nipple on the my right chest and green eyes.. the girls had absolutely nothing. Thr green eyes but my mother in law also has green eyes. "I asked are they mine?" Tears starts coming from both of us.. she cries of course they are! Cops are telling he's looking to press charges. i'm like "press charges? well I'll tell you this, all of this is his and her's fault!" The cops had no idea. I told them where i came from and my career. I told them i've been gone for almost 8 months. lets call the backstabber dick. I told them dick was my brother since the 1st grade, and he was my best man from the wedding. The cops told each other this is why I don't trust no woman. My wife looked down and walked out the room sobbing. cops told me they're letting me go. that they cant imagine what i'm going through. they called me a hero, thanked me for my service and wished me the best. I'm not a hero, i was someone who joined for the pay and benefits that couldn't save his friend. that doesn't sound like a hero to me. I go home, wife says she wants to come with me so we can talk about this.. i told her to look after her boyfriend. She starts crying again. I left the girls with her cuz i had a lot of tears to drop walking home. Once i got home it was a blur. I woke up on the couch with her sleeping next to me but on the rugged floor. i pick her up n put her on the couch. 2 weeks later, we get dna tested, and all 3 of us took a lie detector test. This is where everything was revealed. my world broke into a million pieces. I was completely faithful to her. I loved this woman so much that its hard to explain cuz everything i say is only going to be an understatement. she's cheated on me since the day we got together. I never saw any signs. She only cheated with dick but still. She's been using me for the money i make. I had a sheet of paper telling me I'm not the father to my 2 little worlds. That the father wa dick. not only that, but she's also pregnant again. He was salty for what i did to him and revealed everything. his words were "open your eyes. you're the one who been making money. You've been providing for my kids while i lay back and play my games. She's been cheating on since the beginning. remember when we went to the movies to watch the incredible hulk? (that was in 2008) remember how pissed and annoyed she got at you for no reason? Didnt wasn't you touching her, not to mention talking to her or looking at her? That was just an act so she can go home. She never planned kn going home. She came to my house instead. remember all the gifts she bought you, and made you believe that was out of love? ok.. that was so u can let your guard down so it can be easy for her to cheat. you're not my brother, you're the kids care taker, my money maker. you bought me a car, a home, helped me pay for my college degree, and you've been taking care of my kids. and guess what, you're going to continue to doing the same. You were gone for a minute, but i went to your house and was there for her. Wife was screaming at him" SHUT THE FUCK UP!" i felt numb to everything. As my broken world was being revealed. she passed on the question are you in love with both of them.. she said yes. lie detector said she's telling the truth. that only made things worse. Wife was grabbing me swearing up and down its a lie (relating to what dick said to me). I started crying and told her "You and the girls were the best thing that's ever happened to me. I did everything for us. i bought us a home, we did so much. we studied together, we worked together graduated together, and we made it together, we even made a family together.. seeing your smile was my daily goal cuz i love your laugh, love hugging you, just waking up next to you was a blessing i cant describe. and now i have a piece of paper telling me those girls were never mine?! Another paper telling me i was only your toy? She had a blank face with nothing but tears dropping down like a waterfall. Dick says for the record, you never made a family with her.. i did. you were just taking of my family for me. How can the person that called me his brother for so long be so cold to me? no idea. I couldn't sleep that day. I left home to walk. I literally walked for over 13 hrs. I left my phone home, so no interruptions. I was found sitting on a bench crying. I know a man isn't supposed to cry, but i can't eat, sleep, or stop with the damn tears. All i did was throw up n cried. I couldn't look at the girls the same. Filed for divorce. She moved back to ny with her parents. Dick had no job and lost his home. His car was under my name, his home. it all belonged to me. i make 6 figures and someone that doesn't even have a job destroyed my world. Never again did i help anyone else not to mention trust anyone. i seek professional help. I won't end up like my brother who took his on life cuz things got hard. i'm a fighter who keeps getting up. my ex wife sent me some disrespectful texts. a picture of those 2 kissing the twins, a sex tape of them 2, revealed some horrible things to me. "she told me that now that i have nothing i should kill myself cuz i'll only be alone. that she knew i wasn't the father but what can a guy like dick do for the kids. that i left the twins. and i wasnt the role model, the father that i believed i was, i shouldn't have walked on out on them like that. doc told me not to be a fool, that isn't her send me these things. that it's him doing it. I believe its her. Its her number. The reason i left the girls was because i was scared of what i was capable of. when i woke up one morning, i woke up with a gun next to me. I recorded myself and what i did scared me to no end. I would stand up for a long time. doing nothing, just standing near my bed like a zombie. then i would get my gun from my finger scanning safe and go back to sleep.** i visit my brother where he's been buried every weekend. This was yrs ago, today i'm a pilot who has his own real estate company but can't manage to make a family cuz i push away every woman who i meet. I will never trust anyone again. But thats my mind now, i'm sure one day i'll have a family of my own. I'm still young, i'm only 33. Those girls are 9 yrs old now and i think about them everyday. when they're 18 and they ever seek me out, best believe i'll welcome them with open arms. In case you're wondering what they're doing atm, my sibling told me he's working at best buy. as for her, she became a nurse, wanting to be a doctor one day. good for her.

I am in 9th grade and my brother is 20.I don't know how to solve some math problems,so i go upstairs to see my ask my brother to see if he knows it. Then he says something like " What method is this".then i say "i don't know,they probably changed it or you din't learnt it". Then my brother says " MATH IS MATH", like the meme from Incredibles 2. I went downstairs and laughed.

 I�ll be abbreviating names so I don�t give anyone away. So, about a couple of  years ago me and my friend knew this guy. We will call my friend M. The guy we knew was A. The whole town knew him actually, he was the ghost of the down, the demon of it really. Even strangers knew his name, and not for good reason. The boogey man of my old High School and our town. Funny thing is he didn�t even love in said town: that�s how  infamous he was. A didn�t have it easy, but he sure as hell wasn�t someone too many people Could sympathize with. We all have that one friend who�s a little bit of trouble, and that�s who me and M thought he was. Harmless teenage bs. Well, that�s how it started at least. Petty theft, stole some candy and drinks every now and again, I didn�t agree with it but I mean I was like 16-17 and as long as I wasn�t seen with him as he did it I didn�t really care.  He called himself an alcoholic, but we accepted him.  But as time went on, A�s morality and sanity...started slipping. He started breaking his hands by punching walls at the school and started making the whole school his playground. he secretly kind of began to take it over, but where it gets worse is that he grew a freaky obsession with a girl at the high school, and he began to stalk her to the point where she was super paranoid anywhere, and got a restraining order. And even after that he left her a 13 page note in cards explaining how he�s not crazy ( which **made him look more crazy** )   To make matters worse, he began studying serial killers and how they did their deeds. Printing stuff out, underlining things, really learning. He also was big into parkour and knew how to climb and jump, and even run extremely fast...*and extremely quiet in the dark*. He loved the woods. And even went as far as burning a big bed in it just for whatever reason, and eventually he began learning how to fly planes at tech. He then told me he wanted to throw the planes he was learning to fly into our school...*Soooo* me and my friend M and another friend ended up blasting everything to the principle and police.  A had made a comment about killing my baby nephew as well. To which point I was pissed ( I�m an extremely protective uncle. ) I let him know I�d have him in a body bag, whether he wanted to be a serial killer guy or not. He never scared me and I could match him in a fight, but I also knew his mental state was dangerous. He felt betrayed by me of all people cuz� he considered me family so you better believe he was pissed when we had him taken to the mental hospital by police...*three times*.  Even bad enough to call me and attempted to trick me that he would off himself by jumping off a tree because of me. (Even though I wasn�t the one in the wrong)  Catching him was the harder part. A wasn�t easy to apprehend. Me and M had to do some work ourselves to actually make sureHe stayed put and got caught.  But..here�s what always stuck with me and M.Apparently he made friends in that mentalHospital, and they all waved him goodbye as he left each time. ( not saying everyone in said hospital is stereotypically bad but still ) As far as I know today, he�s out and about. Doing his own thing, as I know nobody has been hurt. Still though, I wanted to talk about this because..it�s *erie* to keep yourself.It�s crazy how you can literally witness someone slowly lose their shit, being he didn�t start out crazy. Be careful with who you choose your friends to be. You never know who could snapAt any minute...*It�s scary really.*

When playing with fire the most important thing to have in mind is that it is impossible to domesticate; at the smallest mistake, he can�� and will�� consume you. The only thing you can do is to know your own limits when dealing with it. This was the first thing i learned when i became what you'd call a pyromaniac. Ironically, to someone who look at my half-burned face, my passion for the flames arised after i got this mark.It's impossible to tell i'm a lover of the flames. In fact, it's impossible to tell anything about me other than I'm quiet, calm, respectful and any other synonym for "forgettable" that comes to mind. Some would even say that I'm passive. At least it was the word my coworkers used when they wanted me to do something about the disrespect my boss had with me. The old man kept making jokes about my face; his favorite nickname was "Phantom of the Opera". At least he had good taste. And i don't really care to who mocks me; what really infuriates me is who looks at me with pity.�I would be lying if i told you that i was always like that. In the beginning, when the car accident happened, it was good to see people caring about�me instead of feeling disgust when looking at my face in the same way i felt whenever i looked in�the mirror. But, with time, i was getting used to it, even beginning to appreciate the mark that stayed. People didn't share the same appreciation as me. The glances kept going. The whispers kept going. Then, even unconsciously, i turned away from people. I couldn't handle anymore being treated like a deficient animal that you look with pity in the street before going on with your life. I'd rather be no one than be that. And so it was created this mask i wear of someone silent and forgettable. My escape was watching the fire burn, what gave me strength to keep acting.�But it's hard to keep the act sometimes. When my boss said, in front of everyone, that he was going to fire me because he couldn't handle seeing�my horrible face, for example, was difficult to keep the posture. I might not care much about the mockery, but that had crossed the line. Still i did nothing, even with everyone saying that i should sue him. It wasn't necessary; he had never really done the paperwork to fire me, so when his apartment burst into flames there was no one wanting my resignation, and i could go back to work.�He didn't know his own limits�when playing with fire.

I used to go to this private school where everyone had their own car to school and I would go on a bicycle for 5 km.  My father was spending a huge proportion of his salary on my education, everyone in my poor society would see me as a social experiment that would fail.I could never make a friend in my school, as it required socializing and we didn't have any extra money for it.  I didn't have a friend in my society as everyone thought we are part of some social experiment.In school, it was really an embarrassment for me to go on a bicycle as everyone had cars and they had to travel shorter distances than me.  I could never invite anyone to my home as we lived a 2bhk with a family of 4 and would always have to refuse when someone invited me to their home.  I could never throw parties on my birthday.  I never had a girlfriend in school.  I wore the same set of clothes to school every other day.  I didn't have a computer and a wifi connection at my home.  I never had any money to go out with anyone for Socializing.  I always had to lie about my parent's profession.I was studying on a scholarship and everyone knew it, when I scored good grades the teachers would see me as "Aww! he is so poor, he would have to work hard each year, I feel sorry";   when my grades were poor, they said: "Never ever should have his parents spent this much on his education". Sometimes, my father would beat the shit out of me when that happened.  Both reactions made me feel worse.My mother was always crying in the kitchen at home because of our tight household.  I grew up in a sense of embarrassment and shame without even doing anything. I had no friends whatsoever, My family was emotionally abusive. My brother is in depression for the last 11 years because of my parent's experiment.Luckily, I found good social circle in college where everyone was like me.  Today I make in a month what my father would have earned in 4 years! which makes me a success story in their aspect.  But I wonder, was it all worth it?

It was back in 2017 and I was going back home with my brother. It was late at night around 9 and I left my garage into my backyard I noticed that my �brother� was in front of me. So I didn�t think much of it but I kept on following �my brother� through the concrete path to the back door of my house. I saw him walk past the door and stand next to the gate that led to my front yard. But I wasn�t paying much attention to him and decided to try to open the back door. Unfortunately the door was locked and I called out to my brother and he responded with �what?� and it turned out that he was behind me. I instantly looked the other way to the gate and no one was there. I turned back around and asked if he saw what I saw and all I can see was his pale face looking past me and I turned around to see what he was seeing and nothing was there. I asked him again and he said he saw someone behind me but he never told where the person went. I was confused and he just looked at me like if he saw something he shouldn�t have. He told me to open the gate to my front yard and I did and I then looked around my front yard to see if anyone was there and unfortunately there wasn�t anybody. As we entered my house I asked once more if he saw anything and with a serious tone told that he was going to sleep, never answering my question. I too went to bed but I never slept just stayed the whole night awake paranoid about what happened.



******************************



[Begin Part 3 of 4.]�Goddamn it! Fuck that, Hoder!� I racked my Glock. �I�m going to go out there and shoot the first motherfucker I see wearing a leather vest�then I�m going to continue shooting until I run out of bullets�then I�m going to reload and shoot some more��Hoder; calmly, �No, you�re not. Here�s what you�re going to do: you�re going to shut up, sit down, have a beer or nine, and cool off.� �No, God damn it. Hoder, I�m not some God-damned fucking novice here. I may not be all military like you, but I�ve been in a firefight before. I�ve seen the elephant. I want these fuckers to bleed. By the bucketful. I want the rivers to run red. They fucked with your animals. They fucked with your water. The beat up Carlos, they fucked with your family; so they fucked with my family. They fucked with my van. Gimme some of that Herculene you�ve got stashed. We�re gonna blow these fuckers up!� Hoder sighs and shakes his head. �Doc, you�re really just pissed off right now���**�JUST PISSED OFF�**? *�JUST PISSED OFF�*? I�ve spun off into a new universe so far from being �just pissed off� that you�d need the fucking Hubble to see where �just pissed off� was�!��OK, so you�re more than pissed off and somewhat irrational. Not good. Give me your guns.��What? No fucking way. I�m not about to disarm myself. Especially not now��Hoder shakes his head and sighs again. �Carlos. Please go to the kitchen and get *THE BIG GLASS*.�Hoder goes all Gunnery Sergeant on me: �Look, Doc. Here�s what�s going to happen: You�re going to give me your guns, and anything else that might be considered dangerous. You�re going to call work and leave a message that you�re taking a day or three off. You said this was just a surprise inspection anyway. Let the HSE rig guys handle this one. Then you�re going to sit in your comfy chair, have a good, long smoke and some of your patented *Old Thought Provoker*. Once you�ve returned to this dimension, we�re going to make some plans. We need to strategize, we need to be smart, we need to����blow the fuckers up.� I growled as I finished Hoder�s thought for him. After a very pregnant pause, I kick the magazine out of the Glock, and rack the action to spit out the chambered round. I hand them all to Hoder. Hoder looks relieved, �Perhaps a little later. For now, we formulate battle strategy.�Carlos returns lugging a huge ornate German-style beer mug, easily 1.5 liters, and an Anchor Hocking tumbler full of homemade vodka. Before he sets them on the table next to me, Hoder speaks up. �Not yet. First, we go to your room and collect all your weapons of mass destruction. Then you can have your sun-risers.�What choice did I have? The van was a total loss, so nothing could be done there. I need a smoke, and a good, stiff drink, so we repair to my room. Hoder brings a Halliburton aluminum job case and says �This is for your stash. It�s going to be locked and I keep the key until you circle back to reality. Now, give.�Well, he already had my Glock, so after clearing the weapon, I handed him my backup Sig Sauer. I gave him my Asp (a telescopic Billy-club good for delivering knots to asshole�s noggins), my cattle prod (actually, an early 50,000-volt version of TASER), my pocket sap (blackjack), my cute little Mossad-issue .22 Magnum backup-backup pistol (it�s the only one I can still accurately fire with my left hand), a huge folding Buck skinning knife, Russian bear spray, and a slick WWI-replica trench knife, complete with spiked brass-knuckles handle and triangular cross-section blade. Hoder goggles, �It that it or do you have a tactical nuke stashed under your bed?� Grousingly, �No, left that at home. That�s all. Scout�s honor.��Like you were ever a fuckin� scout��Back in the front room, I grab the *BIG GLASS*and glug down fully half the contents. I pour the tumbler of vodka into the now vacant space and proceed to slurp in a slightly more dignified manner.�Returning to reality?��Not quite yet, but at least I�m in the same galaxy now.��*Muy bien*. Carlos, please go and get me a roll of drafting paper, some colored pencils out of Doc�s room and bring them over to the kitchen table. Doc? We are now literally going to draw up our battle plans.��About Goddamned fucking time. I still say we need to blow these cocksuckers up.��Have another beer, you�re still out in the boonies��Another beer or five passes and I�m feeling slightly less homicidal, but only slightly. I console myself that the van was just a thing and luckily no one was hurt. But, it still infuriates me that over something as stupid as free jobs for wanna-be gangsters it had escalated to this point. But, they called the thunder. Now, they were going to get it. Holy fuck, were they going to get it. We�re going to bring it and Hell�s coming with us. You hear me? *�Hell�s coming with us!*�Hoder was running the show as we sketched out our battle strategy. First was intelligence gathering. We really didn�t know much about our adversaries other than they were assholes, wore too much black leather for the climate and were generally useless pieces of subhuman compost. So, it was the old �Know thine enemy� bit. Plus, it would take time, and lull our unsuspecting idiot antagonists into that good ol� false sense of security. Hoder told me that he�d engage his huge network of locals to find out more about these characters. Being wanna-be gangsters and shaking down the townsfolk, they were universally despised. Lubricated by a little local currency and requested to remain quiet about our enquiries, we figured they�d drop a dime on these toe-rags without much further encouragement. Thus began Phase 1.As an adjunct to Phase 1, I had Carlos, Tito and Jesus go to the local market and purchase 20 or so little personal diaries. About the same dimensions as a pack of cigarettes, but 1/3rd the thickness. I also provided with each a nifty new mechanical pencil. I also purchased 20 or so cheap-o knock-off wrist watches.I asked Carlos & company to distribute the watches, books and pencils to his most trusted friends. I instructed Carlos tell them to make a note of when they ever saw one of these dark-garbed idiots. Note the time and place; but so it on the QT. Told them that they have to be real fucking sneaky and don�t let them see you. Do that, and when this was all over, they could keep all the supplies and I�d throw them all the mother of all fiestas. That being done, there was nothing much more to do than blow the fuckers up�no that was being held in abeyance for later. We were now in data acquisition mode and realized that although it would take some time, time was on our side. The remains of the van were towed off to the local automotive graveyard, and I stood at the gate to Hoder�s Hacienda watching it disappear into the void. I saw several dark-garbed dipshits off in the distance and envisioned them thinking they�ve won. Maybe the initial chicken-shit skirmishes, assholes, but the real war�s now just commenced.Weeks passed, and the well was coming along fine. I was amazed how some proper tools, training and financial encouragement could transform that motley mob of meatheads into an actually high functioning team. I was a bit more than micro-impressed.In our copious free time, Hoder and I set about gathering, collating and analyzing our collected data. We also beefed up security around the old Hacienda. I managed to procure a load of motion sensors and several 2 million candlepower mercury-vapor airport runway lights. We had some of the older kids in Hoder�s entourage dig postholes and set pipe for mounting the illumination. We also reinforced every lock, window and door on every single outbuilding. I used Hoder�s portable oxy-acetylene welding kit to beef up the hinges on the doors, weld bars over the windows and steel plates over the hasps and keepers on every door. Hoder thought it a bit of overkill when he found me fabricating an entire new door and lock box out of plate stainless steel I somehow managed to obtain for the brewery and munitions buildings. �Like you say: �Be prepared�.�Hoder was going to say something pithy about land mines, but rather just smirked and wandered off to tend to other matters. We ran fencing for the animals, particularly the chickens, pigs, and goats. Gave them plenty of free, but secure, space. The dogs, donkeys, horses, llamas and alpacas were allowed free run of the compound. I gave them all extra rations and a pep-talk that no one unknown should ever again set foot in the compound. Woe be unto anyone or anything that tangled with this crowd. I created a new bump-gate for the front entrance. Sunk half of a 20� section of 6� casing in a posthole, and filled it with cement. Then, over that, added a 6-foot section of 8.5� casing to which the actual gate had been welded. A cute and cunning bit of engineering meant that if a vehicle didn�t tap the bump-gate in just the right place, the gate would lock solid and absolutely refuse to budge. Unless you knew how to re-set the gate, tough tits, you�re not getting in. We also did a diabolical little re-wire of the perimeter fencing. From each fence post, we ran 1-foot insulated standoffs inward. Here, we ran standard outdoor electric grade wire to which a usual farm-type fence trickle-charger was attached. This was for the animals on the inside. On the fence wire proper, we wired in a series of 220 VAC megafarad capacitors strung from a transformer powered by line voltage, backed-up by the generator. This was for the animals outside. Shocking!I did yield to reason a bit and had the graphics shop at work print up a raft of warning signs in both English and Spanish. Garish, lurid and colorful, these signs promised an instant and interesting death for any interloper who had the balls but lacked the brains to cross that particular Rubicon. In the interim, data that began as a trickle was now more of a torrent. Hoder�s network provided much needed Intel but few names. My little plan, after some numerical computer modeling (Fuck with a PhD and get the horns, assholes) was starting to paint a fairly clear picture of where these shit-stains lurked and more importantly, an idea of their hierarchy. It was essentially a pyramid scheme. There was the top shit at the peak of the pyramid. Under that, there were four, for the lack of a better term, Lieutenants. Under these four, there were numerous so-called Sergeant�s-at-Arms. Completing this compost heap were number of foot-soldiers, buck privates and other marchers in the constant parade of bestial barely-sentient pond scum.We pored over the data, models and simulations. Hoder was impressed. �Shit, son. This is some good work. Now we know what we�re up against.��Yep. Now, we just cut off the head of the damn thing and the rest of the beast dies���Herr Doctor. I�m surprised. You know that�s not the best way to dismantle a pyramid. You don�t start at the top, you kick the slats out from underneath and watch it slowly implode.��Nice analogy. You are, of course, quite correct. So, now we just blow the fuckers up, right?�Shaking his head and rolling his eyes upward, Hoder continues, �No, now we start chipping away at the base. I have a few, well, many associates in low places. We start our retaliation with them by taking out some of the lower echelons. A little financial encouragement for my field agents and not only will they think its normal attrition or a rival gang, but we get to add to our knowledge warehouse. I�ll put the word out that there�s, for the lack of a better term, a bounty on information on this gang. I want names. I want locations. I want their accomplices. After that, they can do what they want with what�s left.��So, it�s just become *Open Season* on shitheads?��Indeed it has. You stay here and hold the fort. I�m going to go see some of my *amigos* in places I�d rather you not tag along. Plausible deniability and all that.��Plus you don�t want a big noisy gringo traipsing along slathering for these morons giblets?��Well, there�s that too.�With that, the floodgates opened. We were swimming in data. We hand names, addresses, and probably blood types for many of the lower echelon dipshits. Paradoxically, we had a good picture of the structure of the gang, but no names nor location of any of the higher-ups. Also, the lower echelon ranks were slowly thinning. After a serious ass-whooping by some financially motivated and rightfully peeved clandestine locals, many of them decided it wasn�t worth hanging around here any longer. Over afternoon tea (actually, pizza and beer), Hoder explains that we�ve milked Phase 1 about as far as it was going to take us. We needed to implement Phase 2: active data acquisition. The gang�s hierarchy was thusly mapped. There was:One top mutt. The cream of the crap. He was designated, unsurprisingly, #1.There were 4 Lieutenants. These were designated 2N, 2E, 2S and 2W. 2 for second level, and ordinal waypoint designation for the compass for the lack of any better demarcation. Variably, there were below this level, there were one or two Sergeants each. These were determined to be and designated as 3N1, 3N2, 3E1, 2S1, 2S2, 3W1 and 3W2. 3 for the third level and 1 or 2 depending on their perceived importance. We had fairly good, though unfortunately generic, descriptions of all these twatwaffles. This gave us a dozen active targets and enabled us to focus our burgeoning resources down to a much finer point. Hoder put out the word to his low-lying friends that we were actively wanting to speak with these characters, one at a time, up close and personal-like. He promised an attractive reward for the actual delivery, in a more or less undamaged condition, of any of those occupying Tier Three. We had nightmared up several stimulating and uproarious plans which we were going to utilize to extract information from these fucknuggets. Each a little more escalated and riotous than the previous. Guess it was going to be good to be early to the show�Hoder cleared one of the outbuildings, which we designated �The Unsafe House�. No windows, concrete construction, steel door, double-door airlock portal, located out in the back-40 of the Hacienda lot. Sound, scream and batter-proof; this was going to be the holding tank for our newly arrived �guests�. It didn�t take long, but we got a call one Wednesday night that 2S1 had been located and was currently en-route. Instructions had been to either KO or otherwise subdue these idiots, put a vision-proof (but not air tight, c�mon guys) bag over their head, cuff or zip-tie their hands and bring them, via the back way, to the Unsafe House.2S1 was unceremoniously dumped outside the building, as he screamed, thrashed and threatened. Rewards were paid as 2S1 became acquainted with his new abode. We clanged the door shut, locked it and went inside the hacienda for a few well-deserved toasts while 2S1 calmed down and slowly realized that he was well and truly fucked.Some hours later, we unlocked the door and found 2S1 sitting on the cold concrete floor in a puddle of his own piss. His hands still tied, still bagged and much, much more compliant. �Well, well, well. What do we have here?��Wha...what do you want?��We just want some information, Chuckles. Nothing major. Just your name and details, the names of your comrades and the head idiot in charge of the *Choads*.��No, fuck off. No way. God damn it, cut me loose, *motherfucker*.�Hoder produces my TASER, sets it to low power setting, and gives 2S1 a little shocking riposte. ZZZZT!�OWWW! You motherfuckers! I�ll fucking kill you!�Hoder smiles: �Round 2. Pop goes the voltage.�ZZZZZZZZZZT!�OWWWWW! No, stop. No more.� �Then start talking, shithead. The next words out of your mouth better be names. Real names. You�re going nowhere until your information�s verified.�I look quizzically at Hoder? Really? He just shrugs it off.With little further encouragement, he spilled many beans that night. We had quite the list of new Intel and decided what was going to be next for our new little friend. Hoder, through one of his many contacts, produces a syringe of phenobarbital and sends our newest little buddy to La-La Land. �Well, now what?��It was your TASER that got the info, so you choose.�I grinned like the Grinch on Christmas Eve, �I know just the place.�Six hours later, we�re out in the backwoods pucklebrush, watching 2S1 slowly sink into the pit of quicksand I noted had been mapped by the hydrogeologists when I was looking at the data for Hoder�s new water well. We had a stout length of rope tied to a tree. Just long enough, but still slightly out of 2S1�s reach. Hoder rips the bag off the little whacker�s head and cracks an ammonia inhalant under his schnoz.�Wakey wakey, asshole.�He rouses and almost instantly realizes he�s still alive, but only for a short while longer. (In reality, quicksand will never kill you. If you can float in water, you can float in quicksand. Most don�t know that and the moment panic sets in�well, you get the picture as they get that sinking feeling).�Well! Hi, there, Scooter. Have a nice nap?��Wha...who� You *pendejo* motherfuckers�Oh, shit���Oh, shit indeed. Here�s the deal, Sport. You promise to never say a word of this to anyone, and immediately and permanently leave the area, I�ll toss you the rope. We�ll leave and that�s that. You give us any more lip, we leave and well, I think even someone as stupid as you can figure out where that is headed.��Oh, si, si, si, Se�or. I won�t say anything, I�ll leave. *sobbing* Please, �DIOS MIO! Don�t leave me here to die. I�ll do anything���You�ll do nothing or you�re going to end up being nothing. We know your name, your address, and your family�s details. Got that? One word, we�ll find you again and you�ll be begging for us to return you to the quicksand.���Si, si! Nothing. No words. Please, please *sobbing continues* just let me go.�Hoder tosses him the rope and we walk off into the morning light. �Well, one down, eleven to go.�Back at *La Hacienda de Hoder*, Carlos was bringing us round two of our congratulatory thirst-quenchers. Hoder observes, �That went better than expected. Sheesh, these goombahs would sell out their grandmother for a Charleston Chew���All mouth, no balls. Dishonorable little dickweeds. The town will be so much the better off without them.� Hoder raises his tankard, �I�ll drink to that. Prosit!�One by one, we chipped away at the lower echelon as our database grew. The next Sergeant we encountered was a bit feistier than the previous. He was delivered in the usual manner, but kicked, thrashed and make a generally noisy spectacle of himself. It was most unpleasant to behold. Hoder and I both manhandled him, rather brusquely, into the Unsafe House, where he did a couple of creditable bounces off the cold concrete floor before settling in for his stay. After a couple of sun risers, we went to check on him and he was still all piss and vinegar. A well-aimed size 16 field boot to the breadbasket and an unceremonious toss into the corner seemed to strip at least a little wind from his sails. Checking back a few hours later, he was slightly more compliant. Although, I swear, if this keeps up, I�m going to have to order a whole new set of batteries for my TASER.There was the usual empty threats, dark oaths and offers to terminate our existence, but my handheld version of **T**homas **A**. **S**wift's **E**lectric **R**ifle always won out in the end.After his obligatory jab and sudden trip to *The Dark Side of the Moon*, Hoder notes, �Well, more good intel. My turn. Let�s go to the beach with this one��In a secluded spot on a pristine Caribbean beach, our latest inmate awoke to find himself buried up to the neck in golden, warm beach sand; right at the high tide mark. Crack of ammonia ampoule, he groggily wakes and I swear I�ve never seen, outside of a Roger Rabbit cartoon, someone�s eyes go that wide. �What�what the fuck?��Well. Howdy there, handsome. Have a nice nap?��What? What? What?�Whew, a real *Han Solo-esque* New Hope boring conversation here.�OK, shut up and listen up. You�re fucked. You�re done. No two ways about it. Now, here�s the deal. You fuck off good and proper, say nothing to no one and get out and stay at least 100 kilometers out of town, forever, or you become fish food. Simple as that.��Fuck, you *pendejo* bastards. I get out of here and I�ll kill all of��Hoder looks pained, �Oh, dear. Looks like someone is going to need a quick lesson in beach processes. Herr Doctor?�I continue to Se�or Shit-stain: �Hi there, Tweedles. I�m a Doctor of Geology and have been for decades so you can bank on what I�m going to tell you. You listening?��Fuck you.�Yeah. He�s listening.�Now, you are buried in relatively dry beach sand. As such, you should be able to dig your way out in a couple of hours with this camp shovel here. You diggin� me here, Beaumont?�He�s shut up and now fervently listening.�Given your current location, the phase of the moon and, *ahem* height of the tides, in 90 or so minutes, that high tide is going to come washing in here. If the wind picks up, the waves will make that time a lot shorter.��So?��So, digging yourself out of wet sand is damn nigh impossible. The more you dig, the more it collapses. The more it collapses, the more you are buried. The more you are buried, the more you�ll drown like the rat you are as the tide washes over you. Following me?��*nervously* Yeah?��But wait, there�s more. Let me tell you what else you�re going to win. The more the tide washes in, the more fun little meat-eating critters will wash in looking for free lunch. They really like fresh eyes, ears and tongues�Guess what? It�s your lucky day. You are going to become the guest of honor at mid-day brunch!�With that, Hoder releases the sweetest little fiddler crab he found just up the beach, right under doofus� nose.*Look of horror.*Hoder chuckles, �Still want to fuck us up?��Like we said, shut up and get out of town forever and we�ll leave you with the shovel. Odds are, you�ll be able to dig your way out before you become a soggy Blue Plate Special. Otherwise, we�re going back to the car and drink beer and watch you go under whilst the tide comes in. Your choice, fuckwitz.�Right on cue, the little fiddler crab scuttles around his head and he yelps like a scalded cat. �Si, yes, anything.�I turn to Hoder, smiling, �See, I told you he could be reasonable.�We part, but not before we remind him that he�s dumped all the marbles on his little group and we have all his info. We inform him that he really, really never, ever wants to see us again.We sit up in Hoder�s car, behind the dune line, with a pair of binoculars. Credit where it�s due, he got his hands free in the first 10 minutes. He grabbed the shovel just as the first few molecules of high tide wash up to him. He dug like a person possessed and found out that kindly Ol� Doc Rocknocker wasn�t just blowing smoke. The sand got wet, got much heavier, got more fluid, and a pure bitch to shovel. About an hour or so in, he finally extracted himself, threw the shovel as far as he could and hoofed it down the beach. Away from town. Two down, several to go. Back at the ranch, Carlos was laughing uproariously as we related our latest little escapade. He was sworn to secrecy and we trusted the little goof. He said he knew that latest asshole and he was one of the bastards that roughed him up. We all had a good laugh over our *cervezas* and Carlos� Grape Nehis. The next participant in our little dramatic performance was much like the former two. He wasn�t near as feisty and broke down almost immediately. Carlos informed us that he too was one of the SOBs that had accosted him earlier, so we devised a similar, yet much more entertaining, role for hime to play.After recording his info, and the lights out application, he awoke to find himself ass-deep in one of the innumerable pitch pots (i.e. smaller versions of the *Rancho de la Brea* Tar Pits) that dot the countryside.Crack ampoule and he awakens to find himself in rather a pickle. He didn�t verbally accost us or threaten anything. He was too busy shitting himself and begging for release. Pitch pots are extremely notorious in this region as they are well known death traps. If you wish to have some semblance of a long life, you avoid them at all costs. He knew exactly how ultrafuckered he was. Cure the usual pleading and deal making. He promised so quickly that I had to wonder aloud to Hoder if he thought Mr. Sinkable Molly Brown here was genuinely telling the truth or just trying to save his worthless hide. We were overheard and the plaints and sobbing were almost heart-wrenching. Almost.We made him the same deal as every other miscreant and said �If we give you this rope, you�re gone. Forever. You say nothing. And you never return, even for a visit.��Si, si, si, si, Oh, si Se�or!�Well, all righty then. We remind him that he had dropped the dime on his cohorts and we had all his information, so that by becoming gone for good he might actually see his next birthday.He agrees, most readily. We drop the rope in his hands and retire to Hoder�s car. Again, we wait to see if the wretched little dickweed could extract himself. Fully three hours later, he�s lying next to the pitch pot, puffing like a steam engine in the Rockies going up a steep grade. We decide to saunter up and remind him of our bargain. Jesse Owens would have been proud of his mad dash south, again, forever away from town, away from us. Over our now usual congratulatory beers, Yorshch, cigars, and Grape Nehi, Hoder says �I�m getting tired of all this driving. Let�s shift plans a little and enlist the help of our animal friends.��Sound idea. Which group? Arachnid? Squamate? Squalidae?��Well, let�s see what we can round up��We seemingly ran out of Sergeants as our next contestant was one of the Lieutenants. He was tossed, without much concern, into the unsafe house and left to his own devices.In the meantime, we employed the locals to round up any snakes they could find, as we were in collection mode and were willing to pay handsome rewards. We made certain to tell them to be very, very careful and make sure they�re of the non-venomous variety as this part of South America was home to some really offensive scaly customers. In a short span, we took possession of a fine, slithery collection of pythons, various boas, several Colubrids and a couple varieties of racers. All non-venomous, but equally all irascible, bitey, ornery and cranky. We peeked in on our guest and found the poor little twarf had tuckered himself out and was snoring in a corner of the Unsafe House. Hoder quietly unlocked the door, deftly removed the bag from over Sleeping Ugly�s head, gave him a hard shove and exited briskly. We then slipped a 2 meter long python into his room, and left them to get acquainted. Even though the room was solid concrete-walled, we could hear the high-pitched screams of our latest captive. Opening the porthole to the room, Hoder enquires if Mr. Slithers wanted to talk. �Fuck you, assholes. Let me out of here.�It�s never easy. Into the room go two more slithery serpents. More shrill screams. More dark oaths. This repeated until we had nearly run out of snakes, until finally, he couldn�t bear the thought of captivity any longer and was willing to talk. So, we recorded all his information through the door and told him that we�re coming in, armed to the teeth. �Sit in the corner and face the wall or you�re going to be the recipient of an spontaneous .45 caliber lobotomy.�The latch clanked and as we peered in, it was the Ark of the Covenant tomb scene from Raiders. Surrounded by snakes, all at a leg�s length (as his hands were still zip-tied). Hoder announces that he�s removing the snakes and he�s a trained handler so, don�t move or one might�With that, he simultaneously tosses an irritated boa over the miscreant�s shoulder as he jabs him in the neck with the phenobarb�The last words the hooded schmuck heard were �Dammit. Warned you not to move��We employed a couple of Hoder�s seamier friends to take the snoring doofus out to the south of the city, pin this note to his shirt, give him the ammonia treatment and dump him out past where the sidewalk ends. The note was the usual �We know who you are. We know what you did. Disappear, tell no one and never return. Or else��To one of the belt loops of his pants, we padlocked a small canvas bank deposit bag of stoutest material. In the bag was a certainly, by that time, very, very cranky Colubrid snake. Insurance that he�d never venture this way ever, ever again. �Damn, Se�or Rock. We�re getting good at this. My spies tell me that gang activity has dwindled way down. They�re even missing picking up some of their protection racket money. Looks like we�re having an effect.��So, now we blow the fuckers up?�Sigh. �Like a broken record. Nope, we continue to chip away until we finally figure out who and where the king shit of this dung pile is hiding.��OK, but if I don�t blow something up every so often, I get all cranky. Can I blow them up just a little?��No, save it for later. Carlos!� Back to me, �Am I going to have to get out the *BIG GLASS*?�Our next contestant was another Lieutenant. He had a real aversion to spiders (Who doesn�t?) so we just sort of modified our previous escapade and substituted some of the more hairy and horrible local arachnids for the scaly dudes we employed last time.Almost exactly as before, this pseudo-tough guy folded like a cheap paper plate full of fried chicken and potato salad at a summer bar-be-que. We received some real serious Intel, and found out the name and location of the second in command. Now, the price of poker�s really going up. After a quick tarantula toss and neck jab, he awoke to find himself miles from anywhere outside of town. His note read pretty much the same as before, but the special padlocked-to-his-pants bank-bag contained half a dozen irritated arachnids of the horrible, hairy, and hideous clan. Odds are, we�ll never hear from this character ever again as well. Oh, yes. Almost forgot. Did I mention that I�m an accredited helicopter pilot? Well, I am. So there.I had sweet talked (read: strong armed) the oil company (remember them?) for whom I was working into loaning me a chopper since my vehicle had been trashed. I was an accredited pilot (See?) and I needed to get to and from the rig at all times. So, I took possession of a war surplus Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopter (Google �Huey helicopter� for further information). We cleared and fenced off an area at *La Hacienda de Hoder* to serve as a spontaneous LZ (Landing Zone). We made certain that I always called ahead whenever I was arriving and warned all houseguests and farm animals to keep clear when Doc Rock came skatin� in. Now that things were getting more serious, the 24-hour bottle-to-throttle protocol was enacted. Oh, sure, we still drank like fermented fish, but I made certain I was clear and sound before I�d even think of going up. I came in low, out of the sun. I flared in one bright afternoon after a rig inspection and even Hoder had to shake his head. I heard him exclaim that this was a first for him and how things had really gone around the bend since I showed up. �Jesus H. Christ. A Flying Rocknocker. What next?� Hoder shook his head and had to chuckle at the absurdity of the whole affair. Spooling down, I call over: �Hey, Hoder. Wanna take a ride?��No thanks. If it�s all the same to you, I�d rather die a natural death.��You casting aspersions on my flight abilities?��Not at all. I�ve just had my fill of flying during my Navy days.��Fair enough. Buy you a drink, Sailor?�Hoder grins, �Several, in fact.�Several drinks later and numerous games of Schopskopf later, we just sat around wondering what fate had next in store for us. The trail had seemed to have gone cold and we were receiving fewer and fewer tips on the whereabouts of our final quarry. A week passed, as did another. The Huey sat sulking on its landing pad. I did several fortnight�s worth of work that week writing reports, doing personnel reviews, hiring new faces, and other forms of administrative nonsense. Then one early Friday evening, we�re sitting around the front room imbibing our usual long-hard-day-at-the-office drinks, smoking cigars and swapping lies when the phone rings. Hoder picks it up and:�Where? How? Yep. Damn right. Fuckin�-A. Cash money, on delivery. See you in a few hours.��What was that? Good news?�[End Part 3 of 4.]

(well there's something you dont hear everyday)I then looked out of the window, Then i recognized his face (it was obviously the dude who asked me to smoke crack with him)He was being chased down by 4 police officers in the streets, NAKEDI then notice some parts of his body is covered in some White Powder (Im assuming is Cocaine)We then laughed about it and continued on with our dayAfter class i went home and Turned on the TVAfter watching about 2 Episodes of Johnny BravoI then switched to the news channeland then a News Flash came alongThe news flash said: A man broke out of prison for Selling drugs, Caught naked Selling drugsI then laughed About this for about 2-3 minutes straight.

Just recently, I was thinking about people who I went to high school with, this guy came to memory, and I thought I should share it.In my junior year of high school a new guy moved to our school. He was this chiseled guy, who really reminded of a lion. He had this demeanor of presence, he was decently built, and he was a quieter guy. He was nice all around, and I didn't mind him. We talked every once and a while, and he was actually really polite. There was this girl (we'll name her Katie) who eventually got together with him. I had known Katie since middle school, we lived in the same neighborhood, and we used to hang out in a friend group, but we became distant once high school came around. Anyways, they were the talk of the school, a great couple who all things considered were one of the couples I remember most from high school, they were really into each other. I remember them getting into arguments and such in class and it always making me laugh, cause Katie was quite the character, while he was this stoic guy who was super serious.Well junior year ends, summer break happens, and senior year comes around. I see neither of them for the first whole month at school, and Katie is nowhere to be seen in my neighborhood. One day in class, at my table, a girl named Patty is talking about something, I ask her whats up and this is what she tells me.The guy had been killed in a drive by shooting over summer break. Apparently he was walking home alone at night or something, and they found him lying in a pool of blood on the sidewalk. I was completely shocked, and it all made sense why Katie hadn't been at school. She didn't come back for another month, and when she came back she was completely different, and she would never be the same. It had traumatized her. She was deathly quiet, all of her smiles were gone, and her face was always distraught. I remember her crying in class, and how awful it was to watch her silently weep with her head in her hands. After high school ended, I never saw her ever again. It was hard, and still gives me shivers to this day. She really cared about him, and after seeing someone like that, I would never wish it on my worst enemy.

 We move along paths of destiny. We are a walking culmination of every path we�ve ever taken. Where we stand at this exact moment, is subject to every previous decision. Decisions fueled by neuro-chemicals and guided by previous events. We get so caught up in the hustle and bustle of society that we forget, the entirety of our lives is one massive experience. Nothing more, nothing less. Our identities do not lie within the materials of this world, but in how we shape that experience. The nature of our lives is much like the nature of a great and ever splitting river. We reside in a boat that is our current existence, rushing forward with the unstoppable flow of time. What lies before us is a multitude of decisions, with an infinite number of possibilities. The fact that you are reading these words and expanding your knowledge, means in your hand you hold the paddle. Don�t put it down. Don�t allow life to just happen to you. Strive for direction and purpose, to lead a life of intention. You may not yet know what you want from life, but you will, as long as you keep paddling. And what you want will change, evolve and grow. Your path will have storms and darkness, but they are temporary. You will experience hopelessness and hatred, the rocks thrown by those whose set their paddle down and stand idle on the shore as you pass them by. Be ready and aware of what lies ahead, but don�t get so lost in what�s coming that you forget what is. Don�t fall into the thought pattern of �I will be happy when�.�, because there will always be a �next thing� and that can rob you of your happiness. This life is not a journey but a dance. And although you may have a spot on the floor where you want your dance to end, don�t forget the point of the dance is to dance. Lead it with intention, love and compassion.

If you are under 14 please don�t read as I do not want to wreck Christmas for you. So it was 2009 and my parents hadn�t told me about Santa and his authenticity, I was 10 at the time and they thought I believed in Santa, so it was 3 days before Christmas and we were eating dinner and they were talking about something and my sister was going on about if he could and methods of Santa bringing billions of presents to children within one night and I had an idea to prank my parents so I said to my sister that he takes pictures of houses and ways to get in to make it quicker and my parents laughed and said where did you hear that, I replied that I saw him do it before although he was out of costume. They began to laugh more until my dad suddenly stopped and his lips fell from a smile to a nervous face within no time and my mother was still laughing and she didn�t get it until I packed up my plates and went to wash them and have a shower, I got out of the shower and my dad started asking me questions like �what was he doing exactly� and a bunch of others. Cut to tomorrow morning and an officer was at our house asking my dad questions and eventually came in my room and asked me some too, then he left. Only remembered it from parents bringing it up last night.

I was 17 years old, and decided to be a counselor at the 7th grade camp. I remembered going to that camp myself when I was in 7th grade; it was a lot of fun. I met up with the other counselors at the camp and met our cabin group. It was clear that our group of 7th graders were the... less popular kids. The nerds, if you will. As we had expected, other cabins were playing pranks on our cabin. It was hard watching how this was negatively affecting our campers and their experience. To make things worse, it seemed that they were used to being bullied. One day, we returned to our cabin after a day of activities and found a pair of underwear in the middle of our cabin. This was another prank (not a great one, in my opinion). My campers decided that they had had enough. They were no longer going to take the abuse. They would no longer accept their position as the losers who get bullied. Before us counselors could stop them, our 7th grade campers rushed out to the next door cabin and taped this dirty pair of underwear to the neighboring cabin door, and returned to the cabin to hide. Us counselors could do nothing but watch from inside through the window as the neighboring cabin group returned. We watched as the 7th graders from that cabin find the underwear taped to their doorknob, and suddenly look over at our cabin. They knew. They knew it was us. They knew that we did it.Before the counselors from the neighboring cabin could do anything, their 7th graders rushed our cabin. It was like a scene from an 80's zombie movie. All the other counselors and I were at every door or window, fighting to keep it shut, while about twenty 7th graders were trying to find any way to enter the cabin, and probably murder us and eat us alive. Our 7th graders, in a surge of bravery, burst open the door, rushed out and attacked, yelling out with their best battle cries. None of us counselors were able to do a thing while we watched, in horror, as a battle of dozens of 7th graders began. The battle was intense. A wide, open field of snow between two cabins and dozens of 7th graders, grabbing each other's coats, tackling each other, and throwing snow at one another. I remember one of our kids lifting up a gigantic chunk of snow, pressing it over his head like an Olympic weight lifter, and then throwing it onto one of the other kids who were already on the ground. This war went on for a good 5 to 10 minutes.The war only stopped after a kid got punched in the face. One of the "enemy" campers had gotten punched. We had to have a meeting with the counselors from the neighboring cabin. I was ready to apologize for our camper's actions (though I was really proud of them, actually) but the other counselors informed us that in the chaos and confusion, one of their own campers had actually punched the kid. So, no one from our cabin punched anyone. The other team had gotten so confused and flustered during the battle that some of them were actually fighting among themselves. This was a great memory from the camp. I never volunteered to be a camp counselor ever again, but I like to think back on this story. My 7th graders were the kids that were considered the "nerds" or the "losers" at school, and always got bullied. For many of them, this might have been the first time they had ever stood up for themselves. I was really happy for them. I think that this experience will impact their confidence in a positive way in the future.

Do you ever lay in a bed and realise how not okay you are? Like, the hardest part is waking up in the morning remembering what you were trying to forget last night. How you wish it never happened. Have you ever been in one of those moods where you just want to grab everything and rip it from the walls and break everything because you feel broken and you want to scream and kick and cry because nothing feels  right. Honestly, I don't know what makes me feel happy anymore. I'm just so lost at this moment. I lost him, I lost my world. I lost my motivation and I lost the man of my life. I serioulsy cannot wait until all the pieces come together and I finally understand why I went through everything I did. Its so fucked up, that I told myself exactly what broke me and this lost managed to break me even more. I'm not ready, just never be ready for this. I may have lived most of the time without him before, but that's only because I didn't know what I was missing out on. Now, I can't imagine my day without daddy. You took some pieces of the whole me and now I am sitting here, missing every moment that we've shared together.

Hi, not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I�m planning a personal project where I collect the things you wish you said to someone but left unsaid, and felt them fall into your stomach or settle into the back of your head. I write down the silences and missed words I regret from time to time in my notes app, but recently I�ve been thinking of turning them into a photo series. I�m super curious to know other peoples� unsaid words. You don�t have to provide context (I�m more interested in the words themselves and the stories they can tell), but feel free to if you�d like. If you want to help contribute, please [Goog form!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4NMnNwuo64OrHIqicGLi2tpWXXJzzWF-SUUiCBWh_x9iLZg/viewform) check out that linked form!

 It  was late  on a Saturday evening when I finally arrived home from my  girlfriend's  house. Spring break had just started and she would be  leaving in the  morning for a week on a yearly family reunion she always  attended ever  since she was 8.� Her and I were both 17 and had been  dating since we  met our freshmen year of high school. Her name is  Kaitlyn, she is five  foot nine, long blond hair with blue eyes that can  stare into your very  soul. I would be lying if I said she was anything  less then drop dead  gorgeous. She has a little sister Lauren who�s 15  and just started her  freshmen year at the same school. She looks exactly  like Kaitlyn aside  from her being a little shorter and her eyes are not  as piercingly  blue.At the beginning of the school  year Kaitlyns  dad told me to watch out for Lauren and make sure she  didn�t fall into  the wrong crowd and that she wasn�t bullied. I agreed  as I really liked  their father, I considered him to be a father me as  well since my dad  had passed away when I was 10. I didn�t like to talk  about it so Kaitlyns  family didn�t really know a whole lot about what  happened but they were  understanding and accepted me into their house.  All and all I really  enjoyed being around them and doing normal family  stuff as my own mom  was the head nurse at the local hospital and worked  crazy hours to make  sure we had everything we needed and roof over our  heads. I love my mom  to death but it was nice being at a house that  did normal stuff like  barbeques and family game night.I   had taken Kaitlyn out to a farewell dinner as I wouldn�t see her for a   week and I would miss her terribly. Sure, we could text, call, and  video  chat with each other but it wouldn�t be the same as being in her   presence. I took her to her favorite sushi restaurant in town, then to a   movie before I had to finally take her home since she had an early   flight out. I got home and immediately went to my room, I knew my mom   wasn�t home yet since the tv in her room was off. I took a quick shower   then sank into bed trying to relax. I wasn�t looking forward to a week   without my girlfriend and my heart kind of hurt but I knew she would be   back before I knew it, I let that thought put my uneasy feeling to  rest.  I was about to fall asleep when I remembered I had forgotten to  tell  Kaitlyn I had seen Lauren hanging out with a well-known dirt bag  from  school. I quickly grabbed my phone and sent her a text. She  replied back  a few minutes later letting me know she would talk to her  sister and to  not worry about it too much while she was gone.� I told  her I loved her  and drifted off to sleep.�I   woke up late the next day. It was around 10am and mom was still  asleep.  I laid in bed for a little longer before grabbing my phone. I  had two  missed messages from Kaitlyn. The first was thanking me for  dinner and  the movie, the second said that she was about to board her  plane and  that she loved me. I sent one back tell her I loved her as  well and that  I already missed her terribly, knowing she would get it  as soon as she  landed. I got up and made myself a bowl of lucky  charms  and texted my buddy Mike asking if he was doing anything today.  He  didn�t immediately reply so I assumed he was still asleep since he  was  at a party the night before. I went back to my room and laid on my  bed  before deciding I would go work on the car my dad had left me. It  was a  rough looking 1969 Ford Mustang,  the paint was severely faded with  dents here and there. It ran but was  in desperate need of a full tune  up and some other parts. I stood there  looking at it for a while  wondering if I really wanted to fix it up or  sell it to one of the  neighbors down the street that had been hounding  mom about buying it,  she always politely declined telling him it would  be up me when I  turned 18.�I nearly jumped out of my skin when I heard my mom's voice from behind me. �*Finally going to work on that thing*?� she said I turned to look at her �*Your dad would be proud it was his pride and joy until you came along*� I turned and half smiled at her �*I don�t know it�s a lot of work maybe we should just get rid of it*� She frowned she knew I didn�t like talking about dad but continued on anyway �*Your   dad wanted you to have that car he loved it and you will to just give   it some TLC and you just might change your mind, I have to go to work   now call me if you need anything I love you*�  With that she went  back into the house. I looked back at the car and  decided to give it a  chance, it would give me something to distract my  mind until Kaitlyn  was back in town. I started making a list of what I  thought I needed  and 20 minutes later I heard moms  car start as she left work for. I  finished my list hoping I didn�t  forget anything and went inside to  grab the keys to my crummy Toyota  Camry.�As   I was leaving, I noticed an envelope by the door addressed to me. On   the other side it simply said in case you change your mind, love mom   Inside there was $1000 in cash, I tried calling her but she didn�t   answer so I sent her a text thanking her and that I would see her when   she got home. With that I got in my Camry and headed to the parts store.   When I got there  Mike finally texted me back I told him to meet me at  my house in an  hour to help me work on the Mustang as he was more  mechanically inclined  then I was. I got what I needed, stopped at a  fast food place for  something to eat later and headed home.�Mike was waiting for me in his truck when I pulled back up to the house. He laughed as I got out of the car �*Finally going to fix up the stang so you can stop driving this shitty Camry*�   he grinned I acknowledged his remark with my finger and began  unloading  the parts. He laughed again and started to help. We got  everything into  the garage and began, with him doing most of the work  or directing me  on what to do. As I didn�t have any power tools it was  slow going with  hand tools but the quiet was nice aside from Mike  swearing when a bolt  got stuck or he dropped a wrench. We were halfway  done installing new  spark plugs when he paused for a minute. �*Hey I saw Lauren with that jerk off Randy on Friday before school let out do you need to be concerned about that*?� he asked in a gruff tone. �I *don�t know yet*� I said �*I saw that too and told Kaitlyn about it last night she's going to talk to her sister this week and find out what's going on*� Mike Smiled *�Let   me know if he needs his teeth kicked in that kid is a real scum bag if   he's trying to get with a 15 year old when he's almost 18*� �*Yeah*�  I replied taking a moment to think. I knew he was serious about kicking  Randys teeth in but if it came down to it  I would be the one to take  care of it. I made a promise to their dad  and I intended to keep it. We  continued to work while talking about  typical high school guy stuff.  It was 5pm by the time we were halfway  done with the car. Weirdly I  hadn�t gotten a text back from Kaitlyn even  though she had landed in  California 2 hours ago. I restarted my phone  just in case it had  glitched out but still nothing. I was a little  worried about why she  hadn�t texted me back but I tried to put it out of  my mind.� Mikes  phone rang, it was our friend Billy they had a brief  conversation  before Mike hung up and said �*Lets get cleaned up Billy is having everyone over at his house and he wants us there we have all week to work on this*�   I took a breath �Cool let me hop in the shower I'll meet you there.�   With that Mike cleaned his hands with a rag and took off to his house.I   thought about calling Kaitlyn when I got out of the shower but thought   better of it. I didn�t want to seem clingy and I know she was spending   time with family and maybe just got caught up with everyone that was  there. I pushed the thought out of my mind and headed over to Billys   house. Mike was already there with a beer in hand. He handed me one as I   walked in. All my friends were there and so were some of the girls  from  school. There was at least 16 of us in Billys  basement all  hanging out, drinking and having a good time. I was  slowing drinking my  first beer, I wasn�t really a drinker since  alcoholism ran on my moms   side of the family and I didn�t want to press my luck since my Aunt   Kathy died from liver failure a couple years back. I knew mom would be   getting off work soon so I sent her a quick text letting her know I was   out but that I would be home later. She told me to be safe and to have   fun.�Soon  we all got tired of the  basement so we decided to go out to the  backyard and have a bonfire  since Billy had a fire pit. I sat down in  one of the many lawn chairs  they had and much to my surprise someone sat  right my lap. �*What the hel...*�   I started to say when they turned and looked at me. It was Ashley, it   was no secret Ashley had a huge crush on me. It was one of those things   we all sort of laughed about but when she started drinking it became  an  annoyance. She was super jealous of Kaitlyn and made sure everyone  knew  it. I could smell the hard alcohol on her and knew she was wasted.  Alarm  bells were going off in my head when suddenly she tried to kiss  me. She  was quick but I was faster I moved my head away and pushed her  off me  with enough force she landed hard on the cold ground. I stood up  in case  she tried something else. �*what the fuck Ashley*?� I growled holding back most of my anger and surprise. �*You know I'm with Kaitlyn*�  Just then two more girls emerged from the house one of whom was  Kaitlyns best friend Nicole. Ashley got up and staggered back a couple  steps �*what I just wanted a quick kiss what�s the big deal*� she slurred �*besides your precious girlfriend isn't here to stop me*�  With a speed I was not prepared for she lunged for me again tripping  over another lawn chair and taking me with her. I tired  to turn to  catch myself as I fell but she was on top of me so I did the  next best  thing and covered my face as best I could. Seconds later my  back hit  the ground with a loud thud and I felt the air leave my lungs  and then  her lips were on mine. Mike and Billy were both trying to pull  her off  within seconds but she was fighting them every with the savagery  of a  mamma bear protecting her cubs. Once they got her off me I stood up, I  was beyond angry I could hardly form a clear thought in my mind. �**You fucking bitch! What the fuck is wrong with you**!�   I yelled. It was the only thing I could think of to say. I glanced  over  in Nicoles direction and saw her put something in her pocket. �*If I cant have you then neither can little Mrs. Prefect*� Ashley snarled with a devilish look in her eyes. I looked at Mike �**Keep that bitch away from me**� I yelled again. Just then my phone rang.... It was Kaitlyn. �**Fuck**!� I screamed and looked at Mike. �*You can take that call in my room bro*�   he said a touch of sadness in his voice. I looked over at Nicole again   and her eyes would not leave the ground. I walked inside to answer her   call and I know it was not going to be good.�

Cast:EP= Entitled Principal ED= Entitled Daughter F1= Friend 1F2= Friend 2Me: (OP, or Me) My school has a really... really biased Principal. He really loves his daughter, and always chooses her side with incidents with different students, and he's also racist, to put it bluntly. Basically, I had a list of names for people I didn't like for pretty personal and private reasons that I don't like to talk about. This included the Principal. He was basically discriminating against my race and said I didn't belong here, blah blah, you get the point. One day, it's about the end of class, and the Principal comes in and pulls me into his office. I'm really quiet as he looks through his papers, and checks my student file. I really hate confrontations, and get nervous throughout them. EP: "So, OP, do you know why I pulled you in here?" Me: "Um... N-no..."EP: "Sir. You will refer to me as 'Sir'." Me: "N-no, sir." EP: "I've heard about a list of people in your possession."Me: "W-well, that's... it's not against the rules, or anything." EP: "Hand it over, I'll determine that for myself." I give him my list, thinking I'm safe, because I only wrote down the names of the people and it wasn't against the rules. Big mistake. EP: "OP, this is a serious violation of our rules. For all I know, this could be a hit list and you could be planning to hurt one of these people." Me: "B-but I wasn't! I have reasons for not liking those people, but that doesn't mean I was gonna hurt them!!" EP: "OP, we're suspending you for the rest of the week. You're lucky I haven't decided to expel you, you know." I leave, crying. I didn't think that a list would get me suspended. I just stayed in my room for the week, reading shoujo manga to pass time, but I was still pretty miserable. And when I went back to school, I could feel the Principal watching me.Okay, about a month passed, and everything seemed calm. Then I walk into school one day and see F1 and F2 being annoyed by ED. Me: "ED, what do you need with F1 and F2?" ED: "Oh, if it isn't the girl with the hit list. I was just telling them how I had weed in my locker and I didn't get any punishments." Me: "ED, that's illegal!" ED: "Well, go tell that to my daddy."Then she leaves. I'm absolutely INFURIATED. Me: "What the actual hell?! So, she had illegal drugs and she gets off Scot-free, but I have a list and get suspended? What kind of biased BS is this?!"F1: "OP, we get it, but you have to calm down! Ranting isn't going to get you anywhere!"F2: "It's super unfair and unlucky about what happened to you, and the fact that she had something like that and hasn't been punished is ridiculous, but it's the way the world works. Things are unfair. But you can't dwell on it."Me: "I... I guess you're right. Come on, let's get to class." It's been about 2 years since those incidents happened, and I'm still kinda pissed about it. It turns out the Principal took the drugs and gave it to his brother that lived in another state, and didn't report anything to the authorities. I'm not sure if anything happened, since I've already graduated, but I think they moved away. Huh. Well, that's that! Bye!(Also, when I get enough comment karma, I'll probably post this on r/entitledparents. But for now, I'll stick to r/stories!)

So, to make a long story short, this kid was, and still is known for groping students (all of which are very good friends of mine) and also for being nasty, violent etc. Anyway he also bragged about killing his cat by running him/her over with a lawn mower, wanting to sleep with his sister (who was actually a good person) And of course raping his little brother (a kindergartener) this kid apparently was bipolar, autistic, psychotic, sociopathic, etc as the story was always change when he bragged about his "disabilitys" and would always get into fights with people, for example, I've fought him 3 different times, all fist fights, and he's been chokeslammed for throwing rocks at players during practice, throwing my best friends sister off a thing on a playground, and for being aggressive etc. And also he and his brother brought bullets to school, but not a gun (as far as we know) But I'm getting off track, so he showed a few people a picture of him bent over showing his butthole and penis, and that was the only the start. Alot of my friends are in a "special" class with him and he showed them a video of him sucking his brothers penis and allegedly actually penetrating him (he didn't show me that part before I flipped out) and my friend told me about this, and sure enough, later on he showed me the video. Before me, nobody else had the balls to tell anyone, so I took it to the principal, he did nothing, so I told my family and we brought it to the school and the police together, and he got expelled, and that's it. His parents were obviously negligent, not making him take his meds (at least he said) and letting him run over a cat with a lawn mower, and bring bullets to school. But all that happened is he got expelled. He's been brought to child protective services before, and they have not done anything.(Please go easy on me, this is my first post on reddit.)(I'll answer any questions, comments etc.)

So, I was on YouTube one day, and the video about Minecraft 2b2t didn't catch my interest. So, like any normal person, I would click on another video. But I accidentally clicked on a ad link instead. The link was just gibberish, and it said "SINKHOLED!" and threatened me of my IP address. Luckily, right when I clicked on that ad, my laptop ran out of battery. So, my IP wasn't leaked. I was okay, but I also did not restore my tabs because i'm smarter than that. That is how being out of battery saved my life.

My high school girlfriend�s family adopted a german shepherd mutt that didn�t like men. I�m certain she�d been abused. Starting the day she came home, I couldn�t be in the house without her standing about 5 feet from me and growling with pinned back ears. It was as if she didn�t trust me, so she had to keep tabs on what I was doing at all times while letting me know just how much she disliked me. I practically lived there at the time, so this was more or less constant.One day, the dog had a seizure (I think). She twisted all up and was contorted... and she just stayed that way. It was gnarly: she was stuck on her side, her rear legs stood straight out with locked joints, and her front paws tangled themselves together in an unnatural way, and she�d randomly twitch and shake. My girlfriend�s family didn�t want to put her down, but they also didn�t want to do anything to accommodate the dog. They just carried on like normal, despite having a twisted pile of immobile dog laying in their house. Everyone would go to work/school and leave the dog home alone for 8�12 hours.Now, I�m pretty white trash, but my GF�s family was super trashy even by my standards and the way they reacted to their sick dog was unacceptable to me. I started skipping school twice a day to go to their house. I didn�t have a key, so I�d break in through a window in their garage. I�d clean up any messes the dog made, and then I�d spend like 30 minutes feeding her individual kibbles, letting her lick water out of my hands, and petting her.She got better after a while. I don�t think anybody knew what happened in the first place, but after a week or two she just snapped out of it. The dog remained somewhat aloof around me, but the growling stopped and she didn�t follow me around the house anymore.Sometime not too long after all that, my GF had a bunch of her girlfriends over while I was there. I�m super ticklish, and, at one point, one of her friends poked me in the ribs. I wasn�t expecting it, and I jumped & probably yelped or something.I�ve never seen an animal move as fast as my GF�s dog did after that happened. Before I could really register what was going on, she leapt across their fairly large living room and wedged herself between my GF�s friend and me.The sounds she made were unreal. She was snarling at the friend and drool was pouring from her mouth and I swear she was vibrating. It was nuts. The dog didn�t do anything more than that, but she didn�t respond to me or to my GF trying to pull her out of the room. She just sat there behaving more threatening than I�ve ever seen an animal behave before. The friend had to slowly back away into a bathroom before we could coax the dog into another room. My GF and I broke up several months later and I never saw the dog again. Her name was Abby and I was thinking about her just now and wanted to share. Cheers!

My wife was doing some yard work in front of our house. Somehow she lost her wedding ring in the front yard. She and I spent one hour going through that yard on our knees looking for that ring. No luck. So I bought a metal detector.  We will find that ring for sure now, I thought.  No lights came on. The detector generated no noise.  It did not appear to be working.  So I took a nickle out of my pocket and threw it on the ground.  I ran the detector over the spot where I threw the nickle.  No sound. No luck. The detector was clearly broken. My wife bent over to pick up the nickle.  Her wedding ring was lying right next to it!I took the metal detector back. My wife got her wedding ring back. I kept that nickle.

Context : When i was about 10 or so i had a german shepherd and he was the most precious thing to me. He was deaf from both of his ears and my mom didn�t like dogs.Story : So, it was a Sunday morning and i woke up to find that my dog wasn�t in the house. I quickly got out of bed to dad and mom where the dog was. They told me that the door was accidentally left open and he ran away and that he got ran over by a car because he  was deaf and didn�t hear the car coming. I cried all day after that and still don�t know if that was true.I think my parents just gave him away.Edit: sorry for my bad writing skills

A long time ago in my 6th grade social studies class, I gave an apple to my teacher. I don't know why, lol. Like 2 weeks later I see on a shelf my apple I gave him just rotting. It was disgusting. I was both sad and laughing. I was told to throw it away. I washed my hands afterwards.



******************************



Throwaway for obvious reasons.First I'm going to say that I take no pleasure in being the reason someone loses their job, but I also won't lie in saying that there weren't personal motivations that fueled actions taken professionally. I worked at a YMCA as a lifeguard for about a year and a half. The management team throughout that time was largely the same and also largely incompetent, which starts at the top. The chain of command was my boss, the aquatics director, and a team of nine or so head guards that had a little turnover during my employment there but not too much. The head guards were mainly aged 17-20. I joined the staff as a 17 year old joining a lifeguard team of mainly 15-16 year olds. Because of the age structure here, I had aspirations and honestly expectations of eventually being a head guard. I was young and had ambitions to be in a leadership position even though it's an entry level job and recreation/hospitality/health care/whatever we're not in my career plans. 3 mos in:Some head guard turnover hit all at once for whatever reason. 3 spots opened. I applied, felt I had a good shot, interviewed well. Had my employee review a couple weeks prior and got top marks everywhere plus a raise. I wouldn't make the cut. Three girls applied and got it over me, a guy. I didn't think much of this at the time, but that's a detail that will matter later. 0/1 Shortly after this, I felt like I started being targeted by head guard audits. Meaning they basically test your life saving skills by throwing a dummy in the water and you have to get in and do your thing. It's not hard, just a hassle. Anyway, I got audited 4 times in a month. It's unusual for some people to be audited once in 4 months. The ringleader behind these audits was a new head guard who was rumored to be upset that I tried to apply for a position that was "hers" to begin with. She would later admit that these audits were a power trip as a new figure of authority and had little to do with me but I still to this day suspect otherwise. 6 mos in:I'm 18 now and one head guard spot opens up, as one of the older ones went to college. One of my best friends there, a girl, edged me out for it. I'm happy for her, but I was surprised by the decision. I'm not going into detail here, but take my word that her leadership experience/resume pales in comparison to mine. 0/210 mos in:By now, I'm one of the more tenured employees here because there's a good amount of turnover with just the normal lifeguards. It also isn't unreasonable for me to feel as though I'm well-liked among my co-workers because I am friends with a lot of them at this point and we hang outside of work and such. I'm not saying this to sound big headed, it's just more context into the situation I guess.Two head guard spots open up and I apply along with two other girls, one of which is two years younger than me and had no leadership experience to speak of. I don't need to tell you what happened next. 0/3At this point, I'm just feeling insulted. Snubbed three times, two of those times being suspect. I talk to the aquatics director, who makes the calls. She said I need to work on leadership. Huh? Ignoring my resume, I'm one of the most vocal people on staff when it comes to taking care of coworkers' needs and getting stuff done. I take her ridiculous feedback and run with it since I think there's no way I get snubbed next time and I hold on a bit while longer since I hear rumors two more head guards will be stepping down in a few months. I genuinely like this job and a select amount of the people I work with. That being said, I start searching for a new job after this.12 mos in:I'm coming up on a year here. As rumored, two head guards "step down" at this time. I quote that because they retained their title but would not be on the schedule for over three months. I take notice but don't care much since I have other stuff in my life to worry about at this time.At the end of this month, a head guard and someone who is heavily favored by the boss is fired for an offense that's not relevant to this post.15 mos in:The two head guards from the last bit officially step down after 3 months of not being on the schedule. Three positions open. Two weeks after that, there's still no word about head guard applications (she usually posts them instantly). I'm thinking I've been here about a year and a half and am now the third most tenured employee (including HGs), so I talk to her about it and put my name in the hat without her solicitation. I hear on good authority that I'm the only person that would've been interested in the first place. Two days later an announcement is made that the positions won't be filled. 0/4I'm floored by this. I don't say a word about it though and ramp up my job search. I don't need to say that I'm getting really frustrated at the lack of advancement opportunity here when everyone else around me seems to be getting promoted. 16 mos in:I find a job, more in tune with my career aspirations with better pay and advancement opportunities. I turn in my two weeks. I remain professional. A week before my last day, the boss's old golden girl tells me that I got snubbed each time because I was a guy and the boss wanted to give the girls on staff more promotion opportunities than guys. Let me be clear when I say that I'm ok with equal opportunity and stuff but this was a terrible way to go about it. Boss essentially took quantity over quality here. This REALLY rubbed me the wrong way. I worked very hard for this department. I love my co-workers but maybe 1/3 of the head guards at this time were more qualified for the job than I was. I request an exit interview with my boss, because I'd like to talk about why I got snubbed four times for a promotion. Denied. She doesn't want to talk to me. So, I go above. I arrange an exit interview with her superiors which will turn into a tell-all session after my last shift. This is where the professional actions fueled by personal motivations come in. There were legitimate concerns with the way she was running the pool and they are as follows:-Chemicals were never good, but we were ordered to keep pool open-We ran a splash pad during the summer, and the electrical panel to control it was underground. The panel was exposed and after a rain, whichever guard was unlucky enough to turn the system on would get zapped-Boss was terrible at conflict resolution and would let high school drama take over the workforce like a fucking wild fire-Boss shit the bed when handling another employee incident that's a post for another time-General unhappiness among employees How all that stuff above went unreported before, I have no idea. I think her superiors are just as incompetent as she is because they had no idea anything was even wrong. Anyway, I think it'd be worth adding that I probably would've just left for my new job if I specifically didn't have an issue with my boss. The concerns I shared were more than valid but my reason for sharing them were personal.I walk out with my head held high. Two months later, after an investigation into the aquatics department, boss is fired. After I gave that exit interview, her superiors talked to several tenured members in the department and they all turned on her. I was worried that her superiors would take her side and tip her off that I reported her, and as a result a reference from my past year and a half of employment would be ruined but that was no longer a concern. Yes, she is still a reference, but listed with her company phone and email so it's a dead end. Can just plead ignorance there.Anyway, about a year after this all happened, I'm happy as hell at a new job where I feel valued. Her successor has really turned the aquatics department around at this point and my friends who remain there are happy. I even considered coming back because for a bit, but then remembered that my compensation now was so much better. 1/1I did hear a couple months ago that there is someone on staff there that thinks my exit interview was shitty and unnecessary. She must be an old boss apologist. TLDR: I got my incompetent boss fired because she wouldn't promote me. TLDR2: I realize that TLDR makes me look like a POS but I promise that's not the case if you read ;)

         So, my grandpa and I were hanging out and he began to talk about something that once happened to him.        My grandpa is well known for being funny and making people laugh at anything. He began to talk about a time he had his dog at the store with him.        Alright, so he's in the store, and he's walking around with his dog in the store and everything is fine so far, until, a certain walmart worker spotted him walking with his dog. The rule is no animals unless they are a service animal or something along those lines, So this women spots him and walks up to him and his dog.The woman informs him that he is not allowed to have animals inside, they go on conversing just a bit until finally he says "This is my hearing ear dog. He hears things for me that I can't." The woman quiets down, and then replies "ok you're all good to go." Ever since that day my Grandfather has told many people that story and risen many smiles and laughs from his friends faces along with myself and brothers. What a good story.

I got kicked out and moved in with my friend. So I met her brother and his name is mikel. This fucking child is actually insane, my first impression of him was him showing me and my other friend just cause 4 he was doing violent shit bc it's just cause but he started cackling like a fucking maniac from what he was doing, my friends tells me that this kid is basically a psychopath and that one time he walked outside in a trenchcoat trying to kill fucking cats. He is 14 years old and he's been arrested, I later got to enjoy hearing him do rituals and try to make spells and kill an lizard for it's soul for a potion to kill a demon. One night this kid freaks out and attacks my friend's dad and bites him in the leg and tries to kill him and then he stabbed a hole in the door with a spear he made to kill his dad, another time I was playing Halo with my friends and this kid kicks the door open like he's a fucking swat team and just screeches waluigi in a waluigi voice then slams the door shut and runs away cackling he's continued to do it for as long as I've known him he also supposedly sees ghost and demons and talks to them but he's leaving and I thank God for that I thought I was going to be killed

Horse walks into a bar. Bartender says, "Why the long face?""Yeah, it's a genetic disposition; you treat all your customers to affectionate compliments I suppose?" Horse says with sarcastic animosity. "Sorry," the bartender replies, "I didn't mean anything by it. Anyway, I don't remember seeing you in here before. I suspect I would remember a talking farm animal." The horse sighed before responding. "Genetic modification has granted me an intelligence on par with a below average harvard student." "So B's and C's?" the bartender queried. "Slightly lower. I reckon I would be on the cusp of failing a few classes, and if my parents were Asian they'd have already disowned me." The bartender seemed impressed. "That's pretty smart. Where did they... um, modify you, exactly?" "Please," the horse paused, "Before we go any further I'll take a Manhattan.""Of course." The bartender uncapped a bottle of rye whiskey. "If it's too much to ask, I understand. But you're astonishingly clever for a farm animal, and it's killing me not knowing the backstory." The horse glanced back at an older man drinking alone in the back of the bar. Strangely enough, he seemed to accept quite readily the idea of a talking horse. For a moment the horse pondered the idea that he might not actually exist, but was instead just a protagonist in some red-headed guy's Reddit post. Dude is likely still a virgin. Probably named Casey, or something beta like that. He dismissed the idea a second later. "Well, my creator was actually a brilliant scientist named Cole Keenan. Incredible man. Sharp as a tac. Strong as an ox. Absolute alpha male. Anyway, he was on the edge of an incredible breakthrough in genetic engineering." "And you were a test subject," said the bartender. "Yes. He had finished testing on rodents with promising results and had moved onto larger animals. These tests gave me the intellect I have now." The bartender then asked, "So what ever came of it?" "Nothing," Horse responded. "His work was destroyed when his compound was raided by the U.S. government. He was suspected of violating international trade policy by operating a large-scale counterfeit pringle cartel in the North Korean black market." The bartender was taken aback. "Well was he?!" The horse was hesitant. "I... I can't say. Not to you, and I refuse to testify." The bartender fell silent. Despite a thousand questions circling in his head, he just couldn't find the words. Horse finished his drink. "My uber is here.""Just one drink?" the bartender asked. The horse smiled. "You see, my tolerance is very low despite my weight, as I rarely have alcohol." The bartender reluctantly waved goodbye, and issued a smile of his own. The horse stepped out the door and into the night.

so this was a pretty unexpected date, and looking at it now, pretty hard to believe. i'm actually kind of scared now.                                                                                                                                                                                                   so,    i was going to walmart with my girlfriend and we saw this man (around 40) t-posing in front of the doors.  these two workers go up and ask him where his car is and he says his wife is bringing it. he then starts yelling about trump and mexicans stopping occasionally  to howl like a wolf. half and hour later his 'wife' arrives in a beat up red truck and inside the truck was an 80 year old man. the grandpa says "JERRY I HAVE THE WEED' 'jerry' gets in the car and they drive away while playing cotton eyed joe and screeching about applesauce.    what a great date.

i was in the 3rd grade and we had a sub. the sub wrote the "talkative" kids' names on the board. i had asked my friend (who was at the moment sitting next to me) to is i could use his eraser he said yes. the sub picked up on this and wrote my name on the board. Later on the sub acknowledged that i was quiet the rest of the class period and said he would take my name off the board.He did not.Some people got super rowdy around this time and already had their names on the board. The vice principal came into the classroom and asked for every kid who had their name on the board. My name was still on the board and the sub didn't say a thing.All in all i got a week of detention and had to call my parents. Still to this day the worst thing I have gotten in trouble for.

Well, long story short. My sister was missing her phone for almost a week. We didnt know where it was at all in the house and today (Feb17,19) I decided to clean my room. You know, do my laundry because its Sunday.I move this 3 drawer dresser to sweep the dirty and dust away when I notice something on the ground. Not at first, I thought my sister left her phone case in my room. I wouldn't be surprised. She literally made herself a small space in my room.Anyway, I bend down to pick it up when I realized it's my sister fucking phone.I immediately places it on my charger, call her boyfriend to inform him I found her phone. But it turns out she was coming to the house anyway. So I wait for her, and when she arrives.I walk up to my sister and jokingly say, "I bought myself a new phone"She shocked that I decided to get two phones (*I didnt*) I walk to my room, she follows in tow wondering what new phone I bought. When I point to my "new phone" I just drop the joke and tell her it's her phone. the one she lost.I never saw my sister so fucking excited. In fact it was shocking to me. I frozen when she hugged me, she was squealing and smiling. The happiest person ever.To think she was about to pay $800 for the phone plus the bill itself. Safe

Ok so some shit when down at my school a few years ago (my sophomore year of high school so 2 years ago), my buddy nate and I were walking down the hallway, and he pulled something out of his pocket and explained that it was a stink bomb. So we went into the bathroom, and stuck it in the ceiling tile above the toilet, at first we couldn�t smell it, so he put another one up there, and then another one, we were disappointed with the result, but man o man were we wrong, 30 minutes later, the ENTIRE school smelled like a warm pile of fresh shit that was sitting in the sun all day. I�d say that we were laughing our asses off, but we were close to throwing up, it was that bad. We were caught, but the principal said it wasn�t anything violent or a rule that we broke in the student handbook, so all he could really do was give us one detention and send us on our way. Honestly, I�d do it again

Due to a lost phone, and a missed carpool, I no-call, no-showed to work yesterday. When  came into work today my supervisors first words were, "First of all, give me a hug, I was so worried about you." I explained the situation and she met it with patience and understanding.Later on, I thought about all the places my friends work and counted how many of them would be treated the same way by their employer to a count of 0.

So we found a stray cast a few days ago and she is really curious. We can�t get her to stop climbing on things she shouldn�t climb or eat things she shouldn�t eat. But we have a digital fire place by the dining table and I think she thought it was like a new room entrance or something. I didn�t see it happening but my sisters did and they described what happened. She prepared to leap. Pushing strongly she jumped forward and, SLAP. She hit the glass, slid down, and hit the floor flat on her belly. What in her right mind was she thinking when that cat decide to jump, I have no idea.



******************************



I have not been out of the house for a fairly long time. I do not count the days, or ever want to do so, since this trivial act alone has drained me out of all the diminutive spikes of energy I got left. I am an avid believer of the notion that if something does not function properly, I will turn it on and off and then on and off until I reach the dead-end of my patience, or until I simply feel that it is utterly tolerable for me to finally let things slide. That explains why I spend the majority of my horrendously abundant time sleeping incessantly, hoping that the next waking up will be less agitating and agonizing than the previous one. But the system is not played out like that, so I just try again and again, falling perpetually into a vicious circle, tumbling down each day without ever being able to back out.Again, I devote most of my life to watching the four dingy walls surrounding my bed, witnessing spiders tangling up preys with their intricate webs on the walls, striving to knock up some stale leftover food, puking up my entire stomach, and then weeping on the dirty floors. Over and over again, night after night. I confine myself in my lightless small apartment, and cannot even recollect the feeling of the trembling sunray on my skin, or the feeling of missing the the trembling sunray on my skin. It does suck sometimes, I must admit.I feel okay to be alone. It is obviously lying if I say that I do not miss the frivolous parties and obtuse schoolmates and long, tiring walks down the wilding streets of this lowly town. These acts have been a grand source of nuisance for me; however, I would occasionally choose to feel pained rather than not to feel anything at all. So here I am, staying in my closeted safe haven - I therefore know the house like the back of my hand.Strange things are happening, I am aware. The signs are horrendously ambiguous in the first place, but I get so used to wandering around the place that it does not take me too much time to soon recognize the primary differences. Those insignificant items start to disappear, gradually and silently, from the grey ashes left from my flickered cigarettes, to the old cheesy letters I have stuffed deep into my cupboard. I do not give much of a care, though - those are the dispensable things that I am too idle to get rid of, abandoned and unwanted. Ouch, the lonely little life. Days pass, and the situation get worse. I cannot find anywhere first my silver lighter, and then my pencil, my notebook, the doll I was given as a present on my eleventh birthday, and finally my bottle of cheap perfume. It suddenly hit upon me that these are the pieces that have long been forgotten by me - I deemed them as of no use and then never bothered to search for them around the house. Despite their comprehensible unimportance, I still feel a hollow inside my stomach, eating me alive from the inside. Oh how ludicrous, the greedy creature I am - we are prone to feel sorry and turn berserk for the fact that the things that used to be ours are morosely no longer ours. Fuck it, stupid human instinct.Day after day, I can feel the growing emptiness of my bed, my room, my apartment, and I decide that I should start trying to remember things. The deafening silence in this place is killing me, the void haunting and the pain burning. Excruciatingly, atrociously. I desperately flick through all the pages of my memory, and it hurts me so bad to realize that I am just barely alive, reeling through my days. This is not even a life. My mind goes blank - I have lost everything that can be considered core values, or purposes. I try to conjure up the silver and gold laughter of my mother, the touch of a hand in a cold breezy night, the wisp of a wandering wind carrying the smell of fresh-baked cookies, the intense feeling of being immersed in a good book. But it does not work out, only my reality is there to confront me. No friends, no families, not hobbies - there is me, the hideous, despicable and contemptible entity, all alone in the space of my foreign mind.So it goes, I soon grow sick of the changes in my home, the ardent feeling of being deprived of my old belongings. I feel like a child sometimes, to really want to cry my eyes out when my toys are taken away. Since I cannot count on myself anymore, I make a grave decision: to go out and at least feel the existence of others. I want proof that I am still breathing. I walk down the once familiar streets, devouring the faint fragrance of an unknown flower. The sky glooms over my head in a sorrowful manner, yet the winds are blowing swiftly, giving me quite of a shudder. A nice one, actually. Everything seems so novel and quaint to my losing eyes, and I start to feel hopeful - as I yearn for human contact, my deeply buried mechanisms seem to be writhing alive.I try to say hi to a passerby - it feels so strange, given that I am exactly the living definition of an antisocial introvert. But he keeps on walking nonchalantly, his head gazing straight ahead, and even though I can easily catch the sight of his eyes, he does not seem to take any recognition of me. How quaint - my stomach churns achingly and anxiously - is it this hard to communicate properly with another human being? Everyone, literally everyone, also acts like I am not standing there blocking their way, waving my hands ridiculously, waiting for a signal. I watch the stream of humans crashing all over me, my head spinning and my heart swelling.And then I know.I am it - the no longer needed, abandoned pathetic little thing.As if I do not even exist, as if I have disappeared,into thin air.

	"I died in 2021. I lived a decent life. At least, I think I did. I was born February 19th, 1995. I lived in Georgia. We had a small house in an old town in the middle of nowhere. My parents ran a small convenience store that brought in just enough money to pay the bills. I had a brother and a sister.	"In school, I didn't make many friends. I was awkward and quiet. Some of teachers recognized my last name, since my brother was in their classes before I was. I was always teased, so I ended up taking it out on my little sister. I made fun of her, and a couple times she even cried.	"I loved my parents but sometimes I was a brat to them. Times like when other kids were getting cars and licenses, but my parents didn't have the money. I remember saying that they weren't doing it because they didn't care about me. And I made snide comments for a couple weeks after that.	"I never went to college. Instead, I got a job as a grocery store assistant manager. My parents were pretty upset that I didn't go to college, but even more upset that I didn't carry on their business.	"My brother was in a car accident when I was 17 and my sister and I grew apart. I stayed in Georgia with my comfortable job, while she moved away, got a degree, and became some kind of designer. Interior Decoration, mom said.	"I did meet a girl when I was 22. She was pretty. And she was nice, I guess. But mainly pretty. She and I were together for a while. Then I found out that she was pregnant. The kid was mine, but I wasn't ready to be a parent. I stopped seeing her, but I did send her child support every month.	"My parents passed away and their shop was torn down. They built some fast food place on the lot to replace it. My sister didn't come to the funeral and only a few people showed to grieve.	"I developed a bad cough shortly after the funeral. My breathing started to get short and strained. My chest was constantly stinging. They found out that the chemicals in my vape were damaging my lungs. Eventually, I died. And now, I'm here."				"Do you know where you are?"	"I'm assuming this is heaven? Or purgatory... I'm being judged, right?"				"You are being judged, yes. But this isn't Purgatory. This is real. Most of the time our patients forget, so I'll explain. You've been in a simulation for 48 hours. You are 18 years old. The year is 2036. Due to overpopulation, we have decided to test individuals through a simulation of life. We observe your actions and take note of your skills and accomplishments. When it is over, we decide if you are worthy."	"Worthy of what?"							"A space in this world. We've decided that you are not."	"You... Wait, you what?"				"Based on what you've shown us, you do not have anything to add to our world. No social skills, no drive, no pride... You did not even parent your own child. We've decided that you don't deserve a life in our world."

So i woke up in the middle of the night a few years back feeling extremely tired, nothing out of the ordinary so far , but when i tried. To move i couldn't, Not an inch. When i look forward i see it, a large fully black humanoid with glowing yellow eyes, just standing there, staring. So i look to the side and theres another one going through my stuff, then it turned and looked at me like it knew i was awake and then i immediately fell back asleep. i think it was just sleep paralysis but when i woke up my stuff was moved and my trash bin was knocked over. Thats it thought people might enjoy



******************************



I got off the plane and my body was on alert. My eyes would only look forward but my body was in charge and moved in a way I never felt before. The fear and nervousness inside me was so intense I let It all out every step I made in that airport. I made it to the airport bathroom. He wasn�t lurking around or suprising me atthis point so I knew for sure he was going to meet me at the baggaige claim. So I changed in the bathroom to a crop sweatshit top and still had my black skin tight leggings on. I walked aout and proceeded to the baggaige claim. I retreieved mybag and I finally called him and asked hwere he was. I looked on top of the level and expected to see him and as I watched the upper level I found myself looking at sliding doors on my level and as if it was clear as day I saw him. no one was in the airport when I saw him. he wasn�t ven close to the sliding doors but I k new it was him. I only saw him. my body told me to drop my bag and my coat and run to him and kiss him. instead I took a deep breath and he still didn�t see me but this whle timw I saw him. he was beautiful. His outfit was perfect. His face. His voice over the phine. His face scanning over try9ing to see me. I dropped my bag and coat finally when I reached outside the sliding doors and I was face to face with him and he stood there� I hugged him.. and he smelled like the best thing ive ever smelled on a man and I oulled awayand loudly mentioned how great he smelled and he looked at me quietly. He wanted to kiss. So I kissed his lips� they were soft. They were cold. They were moist. I was so refreshed. I oulled away and he calmy looked at the ground. And then he waved me to alk the other direction to his car. I would have followed him right then and there off a cliff and been happily ever after. Instead I followed him into a space of nothingness.It was several years since Ive been in California and I loved California growing up I always wanted to live there the I grew up and traveled and Chicago took over my dreams. Well I felt back home. I loved it. the smell. Oh the California smell. He let the windows down and I was so consumed by the air and watching mysurrounding that I forgot him and I were having a conversation. I was able to keep up with the conversation but then all of a sudden he touched my thigh. It was as if we weren�t on the highway driving 80 miles per hour. Everything came to a stop the second he placed his hand on. My thigh and he went up and down the length of mythigh and all I could do is stare at his face. His laugh brought me back to reality and he stared at me.. he said�is this okay?� I stuttered like a child and said oh yes of course. My body lit up at his touch. then he removed his hand to make a turn and I couldn�t help but gasp at the absence of his hand touching me. I almost lunged my body at him to retrieve his hand but I had to control every cell in my body in that oment not to. So instead I watched the side of his face look ahead at the road and drive me to his place. I smiled to myself. I then relaxed a little more in the passenger seat. We got to his place. We walked into his apartment. There were no chains or gins or anything threatening. It was calm. It was clean. I dropped my bags in the middle and stood there and all of a sudden he kissed me on my neck from behind. but not like how you think� I didn�t know he was coming from behind. he quietly showed up behind me. he didn�t even touch me, his hands hovered around my arms. And I tilted my head to the side and he pecked my body. He pecked me with kisses on the back of my neck the length and then he came back to the stump of my neck and put himself closer to my body and then all of a sudden he left. I instantly flt cold. He left to move stuff around in his room or I really honestly don�t know because I remained in that same spot wishing to feel him again. So I layed down on his futon. I didn�t know what I was doing I couldn�t believe I was being so comfortable. All of a sudden he came back. He walked and walked and walked closer to me I was about to prop myself up but instead he straddled his arms on top of the futom and the other on the bottom part pf the futon and he leaned over my body and he then started to peck me with kisses starting from my neck traveling down to my arm then my hip and then he stopped and got up and walked away to the other room and I was left speechless. I missed him already. I wanted to call out to him to come back. I wanted to hug him. so then our next step we went to a caf�. He shared his drawing with me and all I could do is find any chance I could to look at his face. I wanted to stare so deep in his eyes. I wanted to touch him.  we traveled our way back to his apartment and then we laid in his bend he was flat. On his bac and I was on my side.I did the strangest thing� I hugged him. I snuggled so close to him.I felt him.My heart felt him.I melted in to him.My hand traveled up his chest and I was so snuggled next to him it was as if we were a perfect puzzle piece. I never felt so complete.  I felt home. He felt home. I felt warm. Oh oh oh oh oh . I felt so good. It was literally one of the best touching moment of my life.Then i was all gone. I feel cold. My heart still yearns for its covering and protection. Hes gone. He left the second we took our clothes off. All I have been doing is trying to search for his clothes to put back on and snuggle with him and let him know im still here for him. Im still in to him. I still want him. I guess ill never find his clothes is what it turns out to be.Not a fairytale ending but I felt for the first time. I felt my heart touch every part of my body. If I could wake up to his face and see his eyes open every morning I would know im alive and I have something to live for. Instead. I am forced for forget him. I don�t want to forget him. I want to hug him. I want to feel him. I want to kiss his. I want to smile every morning and second I get with him. I want to make him breakfast lunch and dinner. I want to make him snacks I want to kiss hi every second I get I want to launch myself at him and be in his arms. I want to feel him. I want to smell him on me. I want to do his laundry so much that my clothes snell like him. I want to go out and smell him on my body and know he is with me. I want to wait by the door every day waiting for him to come home and when he walks through the door I want to jumo in his arms and kiss him head to toe and I want to make love to him. I want to tell him ilove him. I want to nuzzle my head in his chest. I want to snuggle with him on his futon. I want..I miss him so much and I miss his touch and I miss walking next to him and I miss being able to see his face.i miss the close days we had apart. Now we are a year out from the last time we saw each other and my heart reaches out searching for him stronger each day. my heart now seaches for the end all words. It needs to hear it. I try to stop the encounter but no matter what I cant distract my heart any longer. He is gone.My memories of him keep me warm during my coldest moments.I wish this all meant something. I wish he knew how I feel cells in my body. I feel my heart like ive never felt before.Truth is.. he left me that dy at the airport. I turned around befofe I headed into the sliding doors and I looked out to the runway..His car was so far gone. It was as if it never was there. I even looked to the distance and I saw no trace of him. he then became a memory. I was the only one who knew. And im the only one who remembers.I wish he remembered. I wish he felt. I wish he could feel. I wish he could feel my energy. I wish he could know how much I miss his touch.Memories are not so much fun.And so I sit here watchimg some show at three in the morning. I have this whole new clean white page to type on all about him and me and my feelings.Well� Ill leave the rest of this white page for him.. it will always be here for him.. its all his if he decides to return to me. ill always check in to see if you return to me. other than that, ill continue to dream of your eyes and smile. You are simply beautiful to me.

T/w pedophilia At the time of entering 7th grade, I felt like I had it all. My two best friends had recently moved down the street from me. I was heavily involved in after school activities and our school music program. Also the bus stop was right outside my house, which was hella convient due to my lazy ass always waking up 10 minutes before I had to leave. One night I was spending the night at my best friend, let�s call her Lo. Lo had super cool parent that let us stay up late and ordered us pizza all the time, introduced us to really cool music and all the things you want from your best friends parents. They treated me like their own daughter. That night they told me that Lo�s cousin, lets call him John, was coming over. I loved every person they had introduced me to, so I was pretty excited. Then I met him.John was 22, tall and slim with a classic EMO boy haircut. This was 2009, peak EMO season. That night the family and I watched Always Sunny, ate pizza and played rock band like usual. It was fun and I didn�t interact with John much because I was 11 and was really caught up in the discussion I was having with Lo. Our other best friend, lets called her Hannah, said she was going to come over. When she came over, I could see her eyes light up when she laid eyes on John. Hannah was 13, only a few years older than Lo and I but in the 7th grade with us. She followed him around the whole night until we retired to our room to pass out. But in the middle of the night I wanted some water and when I went to kitchen I found Hannah and John talking. I sleepily said hello and went back to bed. I thought I was weird, but when I got up in the middle of the night I would chat to Lo�s parents if they were still up working.  Didn�t think about it again.The next day was a school day and John offered to walk the three of us to the bus stop. We made small talk, but mostly Hannah and John drove the conversation. I wasn�t paying attention until they started talking about music. John mentioned my favorite band and I interjected that I loved them. He asked what other bands I listened to and I told him a few. He replied with �I didn�t think someone so young could have such good taste in music.� All of a sudden I got butterflies in my stomach. They never stopped since that day.That day, Hannah and I talked about how we thought John was kinda cute. Hannah said dibs and I laughed at her. �We�re just kids!� I  knew nothing would happen and let her delusion that she had John continue. Until that night.That night Lo and I got back from music practice and John was there at the house. I said hi and went about my day. But then we realized no one was home but him he offered to play rock band with us. So we did for a while and then Lo had homework to do, so John and I just chatted. He told me if I was interested, he could give me music to listen to later in the night. I quietly said yes and my heart beat out of my chest.  He said to meet him in the living room at computer at 4am. I didn�t think to ask why and complied with his wish.  I set an alarm for 4 and went to hang with Lo.4 am came around and I sprang out of Lo�s bed, grabbed my nano and bounded towards the living room. Sure enough John was sitting on the arm chair pulled up the computer and asked me to sit with him. He looked at my music on my iPod, praising my taste. My face was beat red. He smiled at me as he dragged a playlist entitled �For (my name)�. I smiled back. He then asked if I wanted to go outside and listen to the new music while he smoked a cigarette. I obliged and we did so watching the sunrise. When the sun was up we went back inside and he grabbed us both coffee. I was raised by avid coffee drinkers so this was nothing out of the norm for me, but to impress him I drank it black. At this point Lo�s parents were up and John ignored me. I felt crushed but went to Lo�s room to wake her up for class. John walked us to the bus stop per usual. But this time, he only talked to me. He asked me about my hobbies and ambitions. At the time I wanted to be a writer and kept a journal filled with ideas and stories. He thought it was cool and asked to see it some time. I went to school floating on a cloud.I, at this point in my life, did not own a cellphone. I typically used Hannah�s to log onto MySpace and Facebook. That day when I logged on, I saw that John sent me a friend request. When I told Hannah she got defensive and said that he sent her one too. I didn�t care. My new friend was cute and was showing me music which was SO COOL! But this is where things got heavy.Lo, John and I were walking around the neighborhood after school. We stopped at a house for sale and Lo seemed out of it. I asked her what was wrong and she abruptly shouted �They should just make a law to let you two be together!!� My stomach sank. I thought nobody noticed John paying attention to me. John brushes it off and said he looked at me like a little sister and was just happy that she had such a cool friend. He assured her nothing was going on and she dropped the subject. That night I went home and fucked around on the computer doing homework and writing. When I checked Facebook it said I had a message from John and my heart lept. I opened it and it was just a message saying hi, that he hoped I wasn�t weirder out by what Lo had said, that he hoped he could read my journal sometime and that we could still be friends. I reassured him it was fine and that I would love him to read my journal anytime. He said what about tonight. So I walked over to Lo�s house, Hannah and Lo we�re hanging out I said hi and left my journal on the table. I went home and went to bed, giddy with excitement.The next day I sprang out of bed to my early set alarm and got dressed to the nines for school. When I walked outside John, Lo and Hannah we�re waiting at the bus stop. John waved the journal at me. Hannah looked annoyed and Lo looked sad. I greeted them all and grabbed my journal from John. The bus pulled up shortly and I spent what would usually be a recap of what we saw on tv last night, going through my journal reading his notes. He loved my writing!!That night I got home and had a message from John. He asked me to come over and bring my journal he had questions about a story I wrote. I did and Lo was extremely weird towards me. She said she knew I wasn�t there for her and I said �John is older he can edit my stories!� Which she just gave me an exasperated look and walked away. John came in and started flipping through pages of my journal firing questions at me. I stumbled through answers and then all of a sudden he halted. He gripped the journal, looking me dead in the eyes to say �You�re so special�. I think I died.He kept the journal that night, drinking beers praising me ever so often and eventually it was time for me to go home. John told Lo he�d walk me home. Lo didn�t care at This point because she was playing rock band. This is when things escalated.My family owned properties along the street we lived and one of them was vacant. On our walk home, John looked tired and I asked if he needed to take a seat. We sat down in the yard of the vacant house and he put us arm around me dragging me to the dirt. We laughed as we fell and he whispered in my ear that he was a little tipsy. His breath smelled bad and I backed away a little. He asked if he did something wrong and I said no. He then took a beat, and clearly said my name. �Yes?� I whispered. He sounded serious and he looked deep in thought, �Can I kiss you?� My heart stopped. All I could do was nod. He kissed me and then I got self conscious and stood up, mid kiss. �I have to go� I yelled as I ran home. The next week, I avoided him. I hung out with Hannah at my house and when Lo asked to hang out I said I was grounded. John messaged me that night to say he still had my journal and That he�d like me to come by to get it. I didn�t respond. But eventually I got over what had happened and I missed Lo, so I slept over. John was there and asked me to sneak out to go to our retention pond to look at the stars. So we did when everyone went to sleep. This time he kissed me and I didn�t run away. The following night is when it all came crashing down.John has messaged me on Facebook asking for me to meet him at the pond. I was now fully �in love� with him, so I did. We talked about everything and nothing. But something was happening in my stomach. Something didn�t feel right. I knew I had been gone for long and soon my brother would notice. So I asked John to walk me home. We walked home, holding hands for the first time and I basked in having someone so cool like me. When we rounded to my corner I saw police lights flashing. My brother had called the cops. He saw Johns message on Facebook and called lo�s parents to see if John was There and when they confirmed he wasn�t, he called the police. My mom was there, Lo�s parents and my brother with 10 police officers were all screaming at ME. �WHERE WERE YOU?!� �WEVE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR YOU?!� �YOU SELFISH STUPID SLUT ISIOT� John let go of my hand and tears ran down my face. Lo�s parents looked at me disgusted with me. My mother was in her work clothes, as she had been called to leave work early by the police, grabbed me by my arms and yelled at me at how stupid I was. I was interrogated my a police officer who told me to tell nothing but the truth. I was so uncomfortable and felt so bad that I lied and said nothing happened. My mother yelled at me more after the police left and I cried myself to sleep. My closest friend who believed in me I was never allowed to see again. My best friend and her family hated me. The worst was that when I got my journal back from them, John had ripped out any evidence of our interactions and erased every kind comment. Sorry this was so long.

In improv, we were playing a game called questions, one person would ask a question and you would go back and forth asking questions that makes sense with what's happening. An upperclassman asked "do you have a boyfriend?" a simple question that would be difficult to answer. Honestly, I had no idea how to reply to that while asking a question. The first thing that came into my mind was, "didn't your mom ask you that?"  Let's just say that I couldn't stop laughing at what I said, that I lost the game and my upperclassman's respect. The upperclassman is male which, my friend, also male, said that it was a creepy question to start with considering that I am not eighteen and the upperclassmen is.I don't consider what I said as an insult, but it cought me by surprise when I said it. The upperclassman already has a girlfriend and makes alot of - not school friendly jokes like giving his friend a BJ and 'whoops forgot to pull my pants up' when he was behind another guy. Let's just say that the teacher's assistant doesn't enjoy is references.

Growing up my mother never cared about what I did. I was basically a feral child. My whole life I never had a curfew. I came and went as I pleased. My mom was a hippy who started smoking pot in her early teens. When I was in 8th grade I stole a couple hits of acid from her purse.  My friend and I tripped out looked at clouds for hours. I say this because it gives a small background to my upbringing. While in highschool I had a party. I got a little to intoxicated ( really I was trashed) and stole my next door neighbors horse and thought it would the greatest thing to show my sleeping mother. Now I grow up in a house trailer. If you have ever been in one you know how small and cheaply made they are. Well I get this horse through the back door and started down the hall to my sleeping mother.l, when this massive beast flips his shit and kicks holes in the wall as it runs away into the twilight. I laughed and laughed. I finally drink enough whiskey to kill the majestic animal I just bootjacked from the guy down the road to pass out on the couch. I awake the next morning to my mother asking why there are holes in her walls, floor and horse shit strewn around her house. We had many of good memories like this over the years. This is my first post.  I don't know how this site works but if people read this and like it I have many more stories of this caliber to share.

Hey gents figured I'd tell you my tale. Worked for a company in minnesota called waterfront restoration at the age of 16. Normally you have to be scuba certified in order to work at the place. It cost 400 back then for the certificate and 3 months process so I said fuck it not gonna do it. Had a friend who introduced me to his friend (were still friends) and we partied. The friend of the friend works as diver for the company. He then introduced me to one of the 2 managers we partied together he bought us beer since we were underage and he was maybe 22 at the time. We were all on good terms and they said theyd hire me after many drinks. So a few weeks later after the application process is the jobs first day.The purpose of the job is to remove zebra mussels and other invasive species from freshwater lakes on rich folks properties. First 2 days went well. No problems. Mostly orientation things. Then on the 3rd day. We went deeper than usual. 24 feet underwater in a freshwater lake you cant see the surface. Even if your hand is in front of your face touching your nose. They had us put on 50 lb weight belts to hold us to the lake floor so we could walk around. We were in teams of 7 as per operation procedure. After 3 minutes of diving the oxygen suddenly stops. Now if you have certification in scuba you know ALWAYS check the pressure of the tank before you jump in the lake. My first thought was oh. Theres probably a bit of water in the tube, no problem. This happens a lot and prevents the flow of oxygen a little. Another thought in the short span was maybe the tank just sputtered a bit. Then after 10 seconds. I knew there was no oxygen.I then attempted to take off weight belt in order to float to surface. The belt was twisted. Spent 20 more seconds deseparately trying to remove the weights, walking in a circle panicking during this time. At this point it had been 30 seconds no air. On top of that. Your under all this pressure at the bottom of the lake. It made it harder to breathe. Then I panicked like oh shit shit shit shit mate. I couldn't jump to the surface due to the thick muck on the floor that rose almost to my waist, as well as the depth very deep. Then I decided the only way to live is to walk to the shore of beach. Or attempt to. I moved in a random direction as at this point I did not know what way was where. I ended up running into a pole of the dock and immediately climbed up and after what must have been between 1 and 2 mins underwater gasped for air and lived. Mate. If you scuba have a certificate. Moral of the story. There was a boss man on the dock and he knew immediately what had happened. They fired me the next day. Earned a total of 90 altogether at a wage of 10 dollars per hour. Not worth it. Have a dope day, folks

So one night at around 11:13 PM me and some of my friends were playing Horde Rush, grinding on challenges for fortnite and about 12 PM my friend got off because he had a trip early in the morning. Me and my friends were hanging out, laughing and telling jokes until my friend "CoolPool24" (Not his real Xbox name for reasons) said  "we should get into a, Fill round and see if we can find some toxic 9 year old or somethin' ". We all agreed that was a pretty good Idea but what happened was different. So as the round loaded up some 16 year old kid was screaming to the top of his lungs saying "SHUT THE FUCK UP MOM YOU DUMBASS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME". And at this point in like "holy sheeet, this family is definitely not doing so good."  Me and my friends began to laugh and the kid was beginning to calm down. (It gets worse) CoolPool24 then says "Hey kid you gotta calm down, Your mom pit on to this world she'll hit with the belt so hard I bet you'd be put in to the 33rd century" and to be honest i kinda agreed. " the kid began roasting CoolPool24 but all that really came out was "Your mom is such a hoe she fucked me and im &%!" (Im not gonna tell the age cause that's kind of rude. then his mom over heard what he had said she said that if he says one more thing about women being boy toys she would hit him with the belt his ass would disappear. "NOW GET OFF THE XBOX!" Then all of a sudden the kid throws off his mic and in the background we could hear him smacking something in the ground and his mom screaming while saying "WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT?!" And all of a sudden we hear a scream and the kid coming back like 3 min. Later saying, "Why did i hit her like that... why did I got her at all..?" And i' m here jaw dropped so much in  crushed into the center of earth, thinking "did this kid fucking knock out their mom over telling to get off fortnite...?" And about 10 seconds later, he disconnects. I friended him but I still yet to get his notification of accepting. NOTE: I had to leave out some detail of what the kid had said or i would get banned to hell.

I am currently in NYC and a helicopter just crashed into a building very close to where I am staying! It's really scary. It is believed to be caused by an engine malfunction, but it has not been confirmed yet. Also yesterday I was at the 9/11 memorial and someone put down a bag and ran, and the police just swarmed it. It ended up being okay, but it was scary.

 Backstory: So my family and my parents friends were visiting a beach over the Summer. We visited a little island with really nice sand and turquoise water. Really beautiful place, until this happened... I was helping my younger brother who�s about 14 build a hut out of found materials (there was a lot of driftwood lying around) when I notice a kid yelling. I turn to see what�s going on and I see this kids float toy in the water drifting away. So, I tell my brother �be right back� and run after it. I�m a pretty good swimmer so I decided to help this kid out by getting his float toy. After all, it wasn�t too far out in the water. Doesn�t seem like anything could go wrong, right? Bad idea.I�m swimming and I underestimate the current, the float toy if drifting a bit faster, so I speed up. By now I�m about 200 meters out into the water. I keep swimming and start to get pretty far away from the island. Now people are getting concerned. I am really tired so I push myself and go as fast as I can.  Eventually I catch up to the floatie and rest on it (it�s like an inflatable boat). I was filled with adrenaline and didn�t realize how far out I was. I shut my eyes for a second and catch my breath. When I open my eyes, I turn to bring the floatie back when I see a gray figure moving in the water. I squint and realize the thing I am seeing is a shark. I gasp, eyes wide, silent, hoping this killer beast hasn�t seen me.It has. With a sudden jolt is swims towards me, bursting out of the water, I jump out of the way. Now I�m in the water with a shark. Great. The shark swims toward me and I pull myself up on the floatie just as it is about to grasp me. I�m screaming for help now, and I can see two boats coming toward me. I turn and see a third. I try to block the shark�s sightline with the boat. Sharks are stupid, right? Well for once I was right. And wrong. The shark swims around the floatie to see me again.  By now, a boat is in reasonable length so I jump, forgetting the floatie. I hold on for my life on the front of the boat as the driver slows down. I scream to keep going as the shark is chasing the boat. I pull myself up and a wave hits the boat, flinging me in the air. I land on the boat, my wrist now killing me from the pain of landing.  The man whips the boat around and drives back to the island. The whole time I�m screaming in fear, in pain, in the realization of my stupidity. The shark eventually swims away. We get back to the island and my brother is crying his eyes out. My mother hugs me and everyone else around in just watching, jaw dropped at the scene. Some woman on another boat comes back with the little kids floatie and he gives it to me. I kind of smile and tell him he can keep it.   I learned two valuable lessons from this. 1: Sharks are stupid 2: Sharks are scary3: Never chase after some kids floatie if it�s more than 5 yards out in the water.

I was working in an emergency of a local hospital in Pakistan. It was just a normal day at work. At 2.30 am, when the whole city was sleeping, a guy brought his baby casually. He said, Doctor could you please check him, i think he is not well. The way he explained his symptoms was not that dramatic, a normal person would consider that the child may have a minor illness. However, I am a doctor, soon as I saw that child, I jumped back and yelled ' Its an emergency'. The child was moaning, his skin was pale. His respiratory rate was above 100 (normal is 60), means he was in severe sepsis. I counselled the parents, and told them about the outcomes.We started to resuscitate that child at 2.30am, due to severe sepsis we couldn't find any vein in his body to get an IV access. After multiple failed attempts, finally after 5 hours of continuous struggle, one of the nurse managed to pass a cannula. A sigh of relief, we were hopeful, without wasting any time we transferred that patient to ICU. Soon as we sat down to take a break, after those tiring 5 hours, monitor started beeping. My heart was pounding, when I realized there was no heart beat. That was his last day in this world ;(It was one of the horrendous experience in my medical experience .

9th grade. My dad had been lecturing at me for about an hour now. I had respectfully asked him if I can wear Adidas slippers to school. The popular kids were doing it. I wanted to be more popular, too. In highschool, when everyone is insecure, the smallest things make a difference. I knew his response would be no, and I knew that it would lead into a lecture, one that included words like 'elder at church' and 'In the Bible it says...' But I did it anyway. Even though I knew that I could easily put the slippers in my backpack, and change as soon as I got to school. I could have just put them in my locker. But it felt untruthful. Dad I can be more popular if I do this. Just let me wear it. Please. An hour of him lecturing, and man I just didn't want to hear him go on anymore. So I remember getting up, and telling him, "well fine I won't wear it. But just know, that I won't change. I will always want to wear slippers to school." or something similar to that, and walking away from the kitchen table. "Jinu. Come back here."Then soon there will a punch to the face. I'll curl up into a ball. He will start kicking my back, and try to dig his heels into my face and sides. I will be forced to apologize to my father for being so disrespectful. Then shit, a year or so later I join the swim team, and I'm wearing slippers anyway. And by then he doesn't even care. Life is funny sometimes.

It was a monday, I was bored. I went to target to get something, I cant remember what but when I got there I realized I had to take a shit so I went off to the bathroom to do so. After I was finishing up my business i heard the bathroom door burst open and some guy came running in and threw himself into the stall next to me. What proceeded was the loudest shit i have ever heard someone take. So i finished up, got up to leave and stopped for a second and thought about it. It's a monday, I'm bored, let's see what kind of fun i can have. So i made it seem like i left the bathroom but instead i just sat back down on the seat of the toilet. I let a couple seconds go by then i slammed my fists again the side of the stalls and let out a blood curdling scream. Dude starts to freak out, asking if someone is there but I stayed quiet. About a minute goes by and he calms down, now I could have left but if you haven't realized there is a theme in this. It was monday, I was bored. So I did it again. This time he gets angry and stand up, pulls up his pants and kicks open both stall doors. But in the time it took him to do that i went up and over his stall into the one on the other side. Now hes panicking and I'm trying so hard to hold my laughter in, but I remain silent. He sits back down in his stall, and somehow continues to shit as loud as possible. Again, I could have left, but you know the drill. So i did it again, but this time he was silent too. Until i heard him hit his head on the toilet paper dispenser. So I hopped up on the toilet seat, one foot on either side of the lid and I sat there. This is when I thought to myself, now I gotta do one final scream. So I slammed my hands against the stalls and screamed "BEGONE DEMON" but when I did this my foot slipped into the toilet and scared the shit out of me so I screamed louder than before and I heard him just sprint right the fuck out of there. I get up, shake my foot off and step out of the stall to do a double fist pump in the air because I have claimed victory. When doing this I looked over to the stall for a better sense of accomplishment, just to see the cause of my labours and nothing could have prepared me for what I saw. The dudes pants were chilling on the floor, wallet and everything still in his pockets. I laughed for a solid 10 minutes before walking out of there, grabbing what I needed then going to pay for it. When I got to the cashier I told her that I was just in the bathroom and that I saw a pair of pants just chilling on the floor and I swear to God she looks at me without skipping a beat and just sighs saying, "Really? Again?"

   This morning I didn�t immediately remember what day it was. I went about my usual routine, hurrying out the door to scarf down some eggs before speed-walking to my Finance class. However, as I crossed the University Center on the way to class, I saw a picture placed in honor of 9/11 and was immediately sent back to that day. I was just ten years old on my first ever visit to New York, staying at my cousins� Sam and Hector�s apartment. Those few days were fantastic, just being able to spend time with them like I often did before they both went off to college and soon after, got jobs on Wall Street. On the 10th, we went to a Michael Jackson concert that lasted late into the night. That would end up being a huge stroke of luck.    The morning of the 11th, I woke up to mother screaming at the television and then at my aunt, my cousins� mom. I stepped out groggily into the living room and saw the TV depicting smoke billowing out the side of one of the towers and I wondered, �What movie is this?� I stood there with my mom becoming more and more agitated, and then heard another loud scream as something came into view on the screen. It struck the second tower and although I was beginning to feel the enormity of the situation, I could not really comprehend what I�d seen. I stood there in a sleepy stupor staring at the smoking towers on the screen while my mom and aunt ran out the door to catch Sam in the lobby.   There are a few moments in my life that I believe, if altered, would massively change the trajectory of where I am now and what I would become. This was one of those moments. If we had not gone to that concert late at night, Sam would not have woken up late for work. If he hadn�t woken up late for work, he would�ve been in the World Trade Center. I never ask for details like what floor he worked on, I prefer not to know. If something had happened to him or even Hector that day, I wouldn�t have had the constant support and advice they�ve offered me over the past decade. Many of my major achievements have been directly affected by the guidance they�ve offered me. Where would I be without one or even both of them?   I sat down in my Finance class and continued about my day, but became far less rushed. Something that I took from that day is that, in an instant, your world can change. For my family, they did not. For many others, they did in incalculable ways. If my cousin was in a hurry that day, maybe my aunt wouldn�t have caught him in the lobby. Don�t rush. Who knows what you�re missing?

I have a reputation as a nice church boy. I'm infinitely more popular with fathers of teenage girls than...well, actual teenage girls. However, I know more than people think, and sometimes it slips out. Here are some incidents.&#x200B;* When I was ten, my science class was discussing botany. In particular, we were studying the reproductive system of flowers. I raised my hand and remarked, with a straight face, that a flower's stamen looked like a spermatozoon. (At that age, my knowledge of sex was mostly practical and scientific. I used words such as "coitus," "spermatozoa," "ovulation," etc.) My teacher became very embarrassed. It was then I realized that maybe sex was a little weirder to discuss than other bodily functions like, say, respiration.* I am on my school's Knowledge Bowl team (it's as geeky as it sounds) and on my first day, my team asked me to guess on a question none of them knew. The question in question concerned a "viscous bodily fluid." Now, I am familiar with a certain viscous bodily fluid, and without a trace of irony or humor in my voice, announced "I don't know, semen?" In front of my crush. AND my teachers. AND my mom.* Just last week, I missed two days of school. Upon returning to my anatomy class, we were asked to label the brachial, antebrachial, sternal, cervical, patellar, and tarsal regions of the human body. I guessed based on the Latin roots and got them all correct...except for cervical. I labelled the groin as the "cervical region." My teacher explained that the cervical region was the neck. "Well, that's not where the cervix is," said I.

Ok so this started when I started high school and for days on end this guy who wore a mask would just follow me to my school and this happened for months so I called my high school and the police to set a ambush so I walked to school and the guy was following me as usual and then a cop car pulled up the guy started running but then my school security guard came and tackled him down and restrained him the cops cuffed him as I was rushed into school. Now my mum worked at my high school and told me that the guy was carrying a knife and zip ties and was planning on abducting me and killing me so I�m glad that he is arrested and he was drunk and high at the time so yea.

Please forgive any errors this just happened and I'm on my phone.Characters:MomKidKid2Older sisterDad/fatherThis one is kind of short. It started off when I lying on my blanket having a picnic and this kid comes right up to me and steps on my back and over me. I told the kid "Why did you do that to me?" And he said "My mom said idiots like you shouldn't tell me what to do!" So I went to his mother and she cussed me out and said "oh its probably because your German let me slow this down for you, "You no tell my son what to do ya?" And at this point I started to walk away.Later I was sitting again and one of there hellspawn started climbing on the playground near me. There was this roof thing he was climbing on and a father of a kid came up and told him, "Hey that's not safe. You should probably get down." Then his son came by and said, "Yea you should get down." So the kid and his older sister got down and then went and told their mom. The little kid said to the mom, "He tried to hurt me mom he told me I was a wimp." Then after that the mother and her 7 year old son talked about how the man was probably divorced and was suicidal and dangerous! She went over to him and threatened to call the cops on him.A bit later she and her hellspawn were leaving when she went and told her son to go and beat up the kid2 for "bullying" him. She was also saying how she was going to press charges for molestation and telling this to her 7 year old and 11 year old. So they came up and the kid punched the kid2 that was 4 and the mom started cheering him on! Then the older sister stomped on his face when kid knocked him down. The father came over to his crying kid with a gushing bloody nose and the mom said that's what you get when you mess with this family and kicked him in his nuts! Then he called the police and they hustled away but when she told kid they were leaving he started screaming NO WERE NO LEAVING! Over and over.So they were leaving, I have a dog who was recently nudered and couldnt be touched on his right legs. So kid came over and I told him you can pet him but just dont touch his right legs. So naturally he kicked my fucking dog! Then he started running away and they drove away. The dad got his wife and kids and left. He got a picture of their leisence plate and recorded them beating his son.Tl;drCrazy mom decides her kids can kick dogs and beat up toddlers.

I wanted to put my story out there, in hopes of possibly helping someone else. I'm sure there's at least a few people out there like me.It all started when I was a kid. My mother died in childbirth, and my father raised my brother and I. We lived in a small town, but lived a good distance away, so we pretty much stayed close to home.  My brother and the other neighborhood kids played in the woods and creek by our house. I thought life would always be happy and carefree.....I first noticed them when I was 9. I was getting ready for school that morning and I happened to see it in the mirrors reflection. I was confused, but I wasn't scared, yet..�I just kept thinking it would go away. Probably a bug bite or something like it, and it would heal on its own. It wasn't big enough to be seen through my clothing, so I didn't bother mentioning it to dad.�I tried to push it from my mind, and being 9, it wasn't too hard to get lost in school work, and after school play. It wasn't as if I had forgotten about it. But I didn't constantly worry about it either.�It wasn't until a few weeks after my 11th birthday that panic really set in.�I was playing with my brother in the creek, when I happened to notice a slight feeling�� as if something was moving on my skin. I looked down, pulling my shirt out a bit, thinking a bug or some animal had gotten in there somehow, when I saw them.� I nearly screamed. Instead of just a tiny one, now there were two. And they were larger. Much larger than before, as if they had grown overnight. My brother must have noticed my reaction, and came over to check on me. I quickly covered my growths - that's what I'd begun to think of them as - and we went home, me trying to hide my secret the entire way.�For the next month I avoided wearing tight fitting clothes, and stayed to myself as much as possible.But I knew the problem wasn't going to get better, not on its own. I would have to tell my father. I planned to tell him one night after dinner. But the words were stuck in my throat.�I helped him clear the table, waiting for the right moment. I waited until my brother took the dogs outside, and then as my father washed and I dried, I told him. I still remember the look on his face. He had been washing the salad bowl, and at the moment I said the words he nearly dropped it. My fear suddenly became overwhelming. Fathers weren't supposed to be scared. He� must have seen my reaction and set the bowl in the sink, and knelt in front of me.�"It's ok. Don't worry about anything." He said, and he smiled but it wasn't like his normal smiles. It was the same smile he had when he told my brother and I our dog, champ died and would be in heaven with Mom.�"But .. they got bigger. What if they keep growing?" I asked in a scared voice. "Am I gonna die?"�Tears started falling then. He hugged me tight, and after a moment he said, "Of course not. We'll take you to see the doctor. Maybe tomorrow if he's able. Don't worry."�I felt better that night. It was finally out in the open. It wasn't my secret to hide anymore. We did go see doctor Hadley. He was about 100 in my 11 year old mind, but was probably more like 65. He had gray hair and gray eyebrows that always reminded me of the caterpillars I used to find in our garden. He smelled like peppermint toothpaste, and the stinging smell of alcohol, that reminded me of the shots he gave. My father left the room when it was time to show the doctor my growths. It was like he was embarrassed by them, or afraid he'd catch them�..�The doctor only looked for a second. Then quickly looked up at me, his eyes worried like my fathers had been. Had they grown? My panicked mind raced. I couldn't be sure. The doctor tried to smile, but even at 11 I knew when someone was pretending.�"What's wrong?" I had asked him. My blood pounded in my ears. He cleared his throat, and went into a long speech mainly consisting of medical jargon that I didn't fully comprehend. When he finished and asked if I understood I nodded, but I really only understood one thing.�Untreatable. No cure. No way to stop it. And according to doctor Hadley, the growths would most likely continue to grow. I ran from his office, tears staining my face, my father running after me. I didn't eat that night. Or the next morning. My father tried to talk to me, but I heard nothing. I was going to be a freak. Forever.�I begged my father to let me stay home, but he refused. I rarely left the house except for school, and always wore loose fitting clothes. The kids didn't seem to notice, at least until one day during break. Mr Bolger let us go outside to play kickball after Math, and I was completely into the game, forgetting my growths, when Franky ran into me knocking me down on my back. It knocked the wind right out of me, and I lay there on the grass trying to force air into my lungs. When I finally began to breathe normally I opened my eyes to see Franky and the others standing over me, their eyes like saucers. I looked down at myself and felt the air sucked from my lungs for the second time. My shirt was ripped and a growth was clearly visible.�I struggled to cover it, and get to my feet. "Holy shit" Franky said, his voice low so Mr Bolger didn't hear. The others joined in, some laughing, some just staring at me with open mouths. I guess I can't blame them, looking back. But at the time I was furious. I ran as fast as I could, their hollering, and laughter following me. I didn't stop even when Mr Bolger called after me. I didn't stop until I was too far away to hear the laughter.�The years went by with me keeping to myself. I rarely went anywhere except school, and when I left the house I was well covered, even in summer. I got used to the staring, laughing, pointing.�I just pretended I couldn't hear them.�When I moved away for college I hadn't been happier. I didn't have to share a room with anyone, thankfully. I still avoided friends, opting to keep to myself.�I had access to computers at the school library, and spent all my free time searching for cures or treatments, and talking to people like me in support groups. Some had their growths in other places, growths that looked much different than mine. Those people became my true friends. They also helped me find a doctor who could remove the growths.�I met the doctor one morning, and was so excited I barely slept the night before.�But unfortunately he looked at the growths - which had grown considerably since I was 11 - and said he wouldn't be able to perform the surgery unless they were causing health problems. He gave me a useless referral to see another doctor, and sent me on my way. I never went to see the other doctor. I came to realize that no one could help me.�If I wanted to be normal and growth free, I'd have to help myself.�And that brings me to now. I locked myself in my room with a few supplies. One of my friends from the support groups sent me instructions on how to remove the growths myself. He did it a few years prior and said it worked wonderfully. He warned me about the possible dangers, and of course, the pain. But I wouldn't be swayed.�I got all the supplies listed, and locked the door in case I screamed too loud.�I put a few trash bags� on the floor to stand on to catch any blood, and pressed the sharpened knife to the growth, sawing through it. I'll admit, it took a good while to get started, but it didn't take long to realize how much pressure I'd need.�I bit down on a washcloth, but despite the warnings of pain, all I really felt was relief. Relief and excitement.�There was some pain, and more blood than I imagined. But when that hideous growth fell to the floor all I felt was pure joy.�I'm still bleeding pretty bad, and nearly loss consciousness twice so I had to stop before starting the other one.But I wanted to write this while I wait, for anyone out there like me who thought they were doomed to live life with their growths, their dark secret.It's possible to find a cure. You just need to want it bad enough, and a sharp knife. You'll also need a lot of towels to stop the blood. I'm already on my sixth one.I have to go now. I may need to take a nap before I start the last one.. I feel dizzy, but it's all worth it. Remember, you're not alone. And despite what doctors say, the growths can be stopped. I smile when I think back to Dr Hadley telling me I'd have the growths forever. He even tried to tell me my growths were normal. Except he used medical terminology, and called them "breasts"�But whatever the term, my growths are nearly gone. I just pray they won't grow back...

He isn't even 6 years old. The thought occurs to Dr. Stromboli while she's going over his medical records. Not his official medical records, available to anyone fortunate enough to have a medical degree and the privilege of putting a 'Dr.' in front of their name. No, these are the private records. The ones that the government don't want you to know about.With great power comes great responsibility; with great responsibility comes an even greater potential for corruption. The system that protects monsters like Dr. Stromboli - that allows them to experiment without impunity on children - is far from well organized, but that's part of the puzzle. Make it look disorganized enough, too complicated to the naked eye, and the public will never believe the levels of corruption going on just under the surface. People are like sheep. If you can provide enough misdirects - enough fences, if you will - they'll live contained in their woolly bubbles for their entire lives. Makes it easier to take your pick of victims out of the herd, because the rest of the herd won't believe it's happening. Doctors like Dr. Stromboli are wolves in sheep's clothing, and they have the white coats to prove it. The experiment is designed to resemble the routine medical procedures that the doctor's victim routinely went through at home. That's part of the deception, too. Take away everything familiar, then introduce a skewed sort of familiarity at a trickle; you've been to the doctor for tests before, kid. Nothing to see here.In the end, the purpose of the experiment isn't important. There are a variety of reasons, a variety of motivations, and most of them are shockingly impersonal. We hear more about people in power abusing those who "wronged" them so often because it's another layer of wool for the truly intelligent wolves preying among the sheep herds; those in power who abuse people without reason, or for selfish and illegal goals like forcing a perfect test candidate to go through an experiment just to help a self absorbed doctor prove their hypothesis. If you can pad your study with enough ideal candidates, you'll get the result you're looking for.And if you think the medical industry isn't in bed with corrupt organizations like CPS, you ought to look at a few of the cases in today's world. Why do doctors get to decide to take a child from their family without ever meeting the kid, or even personally treating them? Why do judges play along and rule in their favor, even when the evidence clearly favors the family?In a world like ours, with an economy that operates like ours, the answer is always Big Business. Dr. Stromboli closes the kid's medical file, prepares the proper dosage for the experimental new drug he's being given to treat one of his medical conditions, and leaves it at the nurses' station for one of the nurses to administer. No reason to see the kid face-to-face when all Stromboli is interested in is test results. That's what nurses are for.

Yesterday August 17, 2019 I went into the kern river with my family. We got on tubes and rode them down the river. I was riding with my aunt and we got off but the current was too strong and my aunt called out to my uncle to help us. I panicked but went on a big rock and started crying and my aunt was on another rock. My uncle was helping and my sister and cousin were watching. Then my other cousin and stepdad came and my cousin jumped off the tube to my aunt, while my stepdad went into the waterfall and my sister called out for him, some strangers threw a tube to me and I got on and pulled me in, they did the same to everyone else, but I don�t know what happened to my stepdad. He made it out somehow but three of our tubes went down the river. Damn nature, you scary.

So my family was at Target and we were at the checkout. Then my 8 year old brother grabbed a 3 Musketeers and scanned it, that�s when the machine just stopped working. An employee comes up and says �That�s not good�. So the next day I�m watching the news half asleep, when I hear �Target checkouts were temporally nonfunctional, but are back to normal. I�m not sure if my brother destroyed the entirety of Target, but I like to believe that my brother single handily destroyed Target with a 3 Musketeers.

Good morning Reddit!My mom and dad met at a bar. Like this really great bar where I coincidentally had my first rock show. My mom and her friends were sitting down at a booth eating chili fries. My dad and his friends walked in and there are no seats left so my dad just sits down across the table from my mom. He says....nothing. No pick up lines, no sleezy banter (his friends try though), absolutely nothing but awkward eye contact. Eventually one of my mom�s friends (We�ll call her Daisy) wants to go to the bathroom, so my dad gets up and let�s her out. While Daisy is away my parents and their friends still make no conversation. Daisy comes back and my dad has to slide over so she can have her seat back. So now my mom goes �Well I guess he stuck with us.� So they finally have to actually talk to each other.When I was told this story I asked my mom �Ooooo were you out like really late? Like 2:00?�She gave me the �you stupid?� look and said �No, we had jobs. It was like 7:00.�I thank Daisy�s bladder and a full bar for my being alive today.

I was playing home run derby in the park on what seems to be the first beautiful summer day in Cali, when I heard a faint scream for help. Once in tune with the distress I ran towards the sound as my stomach churned with what I might find. Fear is a funny thing, it tends to find it's way into your heart when you least expect it. When I come face to face with someone utterly helpless I feel like their fear gets inscribed in the back of my throat. In an adrenaline fueled moment I got to the source of the sounds. Every year they open the dams at the first glimpse of summer to limit algae growth in the rivers, as a result the once mildly turbulent river grows violent. In the rapids was a young wirey blonde haired kid, i'd guess about 11 years old. Inbetween mouthfuls of water he let out choked gasps for help as he held on to a fallen branch in the middle of the rapids. My friends all stood there numb, their faces were shocked and they just stood there captivated by the sight before them. You always want to be the hero, in my day dreams while on my school bus I was always the fearless no self regard for safety lifesaver type. Real life is different, even the adults present seemed like spectators, wide eyed while holding their breath. Without a thought I dove in and swam like my own life depended on it to the tree and this kid. I was lucky to catch a branch of my own to keep from being swept away. I couldn't think of anything other than this kids safety, like it was my own-self fighting for my life. I told Jake that he would be alright and I would get him out of this situation, and I did. The kid nearly drowned me the way he choked me out after I told him to grab onto my back. about a quarter mile downstream I reached a jetty and was able to get him on the shore. Like the audience of a reality tv show the group of onlookers had migrated to out location. The petrified kid told me he was trying to cross the river on a fallen tree to impress his friends( I thought to myself, maybe I should have let this one go to natural selection...) One of the ladies exclaimed "Thank you Jesus for saving this young boys life today" then she asked everyone to pray. I murmered a fuck you and left, still a little shaken from the ordeal. I'm glad I made that young daydreamer proud, For the record I don't feel like a damn hero. I would have thought anyone would do the same in this situation, while the reality served to be a slap in the face, I will have to ponder this.

The time had finally come. The earlier predicted Doomsday of 2012 had occurred. You wake up to a loud tornado siren and peer through your windows. There is a HUGE cloud moving toward the city.You head to the balcony knowing the risk. People are rioting and murdering each other for food and weaponry. You attempt to call your family members, no one will answer, and so you try to book it.As you go down, you notice that the hotel is barren and empty. But right as you get out, the ground shakes thus creating cracks in the floor. People end up in the wrong place at the wrong time and sink into the floor slowly and painfully.The cloud is at the tip of the city about to unleash hell upon everyone there. You decided to make a run for it as cars crash into each other as an effort to run from the boundless hell scape. When you see the outside of the city, you fall to your knees. It�s all on fire and the shock wave is heading into the city and so you find a small heavily fortified area. The buildings come crashing with the shake of thunder. The lights in the bunker flicker. You hear odd noises above.. almost monster like.You look around for a while until giving yourself the courage to get out of the bunker. Should you have? No. Did you? Yes. There is only dust and smoke. Anything else is rubble or on fire. Movement goes on around you. Hissing sounds follow you as you scramble to find people who aren�t dead. Before you know it, something bites your leg.Part 2:What ever this thing is, it�s in pain. Screeching.. you decide to fire a bullet to its head. �Help me..� By this point, you know it is human. It was covered in blood and some odd looking goo. You put a bullet in its head to end the pain it has suffered. You hesitate to move forward as more rustling is heard throughout the mist.8 legged creatures begin to appear and you feel like this is the end. BANG. You begin to think a bullet killed one of them, but when you look up.. the sky is red. A volcano must have erupted. Hundreds of small rocks rage upon the ravaged city. The creatures go down like flies. This is your chance to run to safety, but the situation you are in has you completely frozen. Your body goes into complete auto pilot and you sprint to the bunkers as if thousands of people are trying to kill you.You had finally reached the bunker but you had no energy. You weren�t sleepy so it would have to be either you were thirsty or hungry. It turns out, it was both of the 2. You frantically scramble through the fridge but there is only soup and a half eaten fish. Other than that, 5 bottles of water. You take a short sip of water as the siren continues to play, then.. the knockout begins.Part 3!Every light or thing that requires electricity immediately shuts off. It was a matter of time which was why when you packed to leave, you brought batteries. You load them into the fridge as the sounds of pain ensue from the outside.You were about to relax but then you�re reminded by the back of your head that almost every nuclear power plant has by now exploded releasing many toxic gases and killing anything that�s normal painfully and slowly. You attempt to find ANYTHING at all to protect yourself but to no avail.Your thoughts go from finding protective clothing to suicide. There is no hope, just hoping for the best is all that can be done. Should you go outside, you will rot like a dead tree.The next few days are spent in the bunker and you begin to develop insanity. You can barely sleep either. But you didn�t check under the bed, where the suit actually was.You use hours to develop the courage to go outside and you just go into autopilot yet again. The outside was lush, but dark, swampy, and some bits are on fire. Dead rotted bodies are everywhere. The only thing alive other than plants are small little creatures one by on clipping onto your shoe. Larger ones encircle you, so you grab the gun and you poise to fire but someone decides to fire before you. You assist them yet you have yet to even see where the shooting was coming from.�You there, I�m not here to save or kill you. I just want supplies. You can give them to me, or you WILL die.� You hesitate to make a move but as soon as you hear a click, you get down. Gun shot.. your next move is a life or death choice. You pull the gun on them before they can reload. �Argh! No.. not here. It�s all over for you anyways. The yellow worm is coming. You sense a presence behind you and book it. The shadow was enough to scare you.Howdy. Part 4 soon.

Its not like it�s any different than any other day, but my mind just feels overwhelmedI�m still worrying about the things from yesterday, and the day before, and the day before... I just want one day I can wake up without this stressI guess that�s the curse of my own loneliness I�ve never had an issue with being alone, but it keeps me in my own head And that warrants stress to keep building up And youYou�re a big part of thatAnd you make it worseI know I shouldn�t blame you, it�s not like you know what I feel inside And I know you can solve my loneliness, but there�s too much in the way And I thought you wanted me, but I don�t think that�s true any moreThat�s just how it goes I guess, you can�t always get what you want But knowing that doesn�t make it hurt any less

Hey, I'm new here  and i kinda felt  like sharing a story about the confusing situation  of my family I'm sorry if its not the place for this.   Anyway the past while I've been just beginning to realise or pick up more on the fact that my family acting the way they act isn't too nice  essentially  constantly  calling me names telling me how shitty and  useless i am and how I'm stupid (too stupid for college ect,), comparing me to their deemed worst part of the family  deeming  how i am a "leech" due  to them needing to house clothe and feed me  and me being  focused in my education 5 to 6 days a week and so on Recently they've hit the point  of refusing   to let me to college  after this year although my program is a two year one and  trying to force me to get a full time job  ( I'm 16 and  staying in education till 18 is essentially  mandatory by law) all because I'm not particularly  happy skipping days  since they refuse to contact  my college and justify  my absence  and get very upset about the college calling them  when i did skip a day for them and requesting  to justify  my absence after which they deemed that asking  why i wasn't  in  was a personal question  although its part of procedure. In The confusing part is that  they will essentially act semi nice to me  offer food ect  but will essentially tell me to my face I'm a failure or just talk about how shitty  and useless i am while  I'm not around . Which as much as i feel hurt and upset makes me doubt  if the situation  is idk as bad as my boyfriend  or  people  who I've told think.If  anyone wishes for me to explain in more detail please ask  I'm essentially confused about  the whole situation  and i do wish to figure out and i feel like some outside input may help

      "Nope, nope, nope," Ema thought as she sat waiting for her interview. "There's no way."      Even though she knew she had been in college for just as long as the others she knew the kind of predgidous that was shown to young women such as herself. "I can't do this," Ema thought know doodling on her arm with a pen.        Then, a voice called out, "Ms. Emelia Grey?"         Ema grabbed her purse and shuffled to the interviewing room. It was the size of a broom closet and not very appealing. She knew the school district was poor, but she didn't know how much so. She had a seat and answered the man sitting across from hers questions.         After the interview Ema stood to leave. Out of the corner of her eye she saw the man stand too. He walked up behind her and placed his hand on her shoulder. "Blondie, you know your awfully pretty. Don't you need a man like me to protect you?" his voice whispered in her ear.         Ema was still as she was handed a piece of paper with a phone number jotted on it. "Thank you, sir," she whispered, nodding her head.         Her legs moved faster than she could think- right out of the building. She picked up speed running home. The wind stung her face so badly, she almost didn't notice the hot tears streaming down her face.

This year, a bunch of boys peed on the floor in the boys bathroom to protest about the new bathroom passes where we had to sign a sheet of paper instead of take out planners. Some of our teachers are making us wear vests that say �PROPERTY OF [TEACHER], PLEASE RETURN WITH CARE�One boy got hurt when he slipped tripped and fell in the pee trying to imitate some other boys. He had to go to the emergency room.Last year, my friend smelled something in the baritone and got his mom, who is the band teacher, to see what it was. He thought it must have been some valve oil, instead, somebody peed in it.One of my friends was doing her makeup by herself in the bathroom and I noticed the pee on the floor and she turned around and said �don�t tell anyone.� I told the teacher, and she didn�t really care.One of my friends got out a water bottle last year when the teacher wouldn�t let us use the bathroom, drank all of the water in it, and threaten the teacher by saying �I�m gonna pee all over you if you don�t let me use the bathroom�Middle school everyone

Right now I'm sitting next to my best friend in our high school home coming dance, maybe 10 min ago another kid who really hates my best friend "ethan" said he was going to stab him with a giant switchblade, I proceeded to tell the school guard and they searched for him. I found Ethan and told him about the kid. We know he was caught. That's all that has happened so far.Update- ight so the dance is over and I'm home rn and the kid who I'll call "Jacob", was caught and questioned. They found the knives, he said they were *self defence*

Sunglasses were invented by the first cave man to squint his eyesThat cave man�s name was Horace, and he later became a millionaire by copyrighting the act of squinting your eyes, and later invented eyelids simply by squinting so often, that he evolved and grew them. Everyone else followed suit and developed eyelids, at which point copyright infringement generated more revenue than the caveman could handle.At this point, the excessive wealth and collective hatred from those he was collecting this wealth from started to weigh on him. He developed a rock addiction.One day, as he was finally running out of money and life was beginning to return to normal, he had one last rock... a special one for his last goodbye and departure from his addiction. It was a white rock he had been saving. This is when he accidentally discovered salt and became rich yet again. He was distraught and coined the phrase �fuck my life� which then became a meme and made him even more famous.He started looking at his discovery of salt as the greatest curse that could ever befall him, and began complaining and whining about it 24/7. He was constantly angry, and it was due to salt. The community then started calling him �salty� and the term is still in use to this day!Horace later killed himself.

I think I woke up at like 6:24 or 6:25. Anyways, I took a shower and then put my clothes on then went onto the bus. When I got on the bus I watch searched by the guard who checked my bookbag and pockets for phones since you can't take them to school. I didn't have my phone on me.When I got to school I stood by the area in the parking lot where all students are supposed to be at before they head to their classes. I then saw Mark who greeted me and we did the handshake that people in Tobinworld do where you put your hand out and then the other guy slaps your palm and then you both fistbump. It's weird, it's just something that just kinda popped into existence one day and then everyone just started to do it, we don't even have a name for it as far as I know.Then Nathan, that creepy kid no one likes from a different classroom walked up to up Simon, a classmate of mine and said that the PS4 sucks and he sold his. Simon wanted him to fuck off like just like anyone else who ever talks to Nathan and he told him that "Noone cares." and "Oh cool, goodbye."Then Simon started to this other classmate of mine who I forgot and told him that Louie, a senior who was classmates with us last year is now working at McDonald's. And by pure chance when we got into the classroom and I chose my seat, I found Louie's old school journal we used for our daily assignments at the beginning of the day where we have to write a journal entry, usually with some sort of writing prompt on the whiteboard. Ok so like, it seems that Louie didn't bring it home at the end of the year like everyone else did. I read some it of it. Apparently his favorite movie is the Fast and the Furious 8 and he wanted to go to college and become a actor. Has ~~flipping burgers~~ acting become the go-to way to pay off student loans?At lunch I was sitting with Mark and Anthony when all of a sudden Nick came to sit and began a conversation with me and Mark. I asked him how Berlin was and he told me that he is going to Berlin next week. I asked him what he was up to this summer. He went did some traveling to Vermont and did some housework and got injured and recovered from his injuries.Me and Mark asked him when he could meet him for counseling sessions. He said that he's been having trouble keeping up with the amount of students leaving and entering the school this year to the point that he doesn't even know who is even supposed to be here really since all of the massive changes. He said that he needs to adjust to stuff so he can do a session with me and that it probably happen later this week. When he left I told him "It was nice catching up with you."Near the end of the day our new teacher had finally entered the class and introduced herself. Earlier today the janitor was substituting since our previous teacher had quit. We all had to introduce ourselves, I was the one who had to first."Hey my name is (REDACTED) and I'm in the eleventh grade.""What's your name?" I'd thought I'd ask her since she never mentioned it up to that point. Everyone laughed when I said that for some reason and after the other introductions were done she eventually told us her name. She was an asian lady so no one understood her name. I asked if she was Chinese, Korean or Philipino and she said no all of those questions. I theorized that she was Japanese since she didn't mention what kind of asian she was. If she is indeed Japanese then I probably could spell her name in English letters since I'm learning Japanese. Anyways the class just agreed to call her "Miss H" and left it at that.She tried to write down the classroom rules on the whiteboard and go through them with us but she was constantly interrupted by everyone's verbal shitposting and ad hominems thrown at one another. Some of it was pretty funny though, like when Simon got mad at this new kid who claims to smoke a pack of cigarettes everyday and said "I hope you die from all those cigarettes you smoke!" my gut got busted by some of those lines. After going through the rules we all left the classroom soon after and went onto the buses to go home.I originally posted this story here:   [https://i-me-and-myself.neocities.org/firstjunior.html](https://i-me-and-myself.neocities.org/firstjunior.html)

Read the title, you can tell this is gonna get weird. I'm gonna mark it NSFW just in case. Anyway, this is a story that had it's peak a few hours ago, but I will, of course start at the beginning. A few months ago, I met this guy. Obviously not posting his real name, so we'll just call him Eric. Any who, Eric and I became close friends, because we understood each other's dark senses of humor and we could relate to each other.At the same time, my friend, who for the sake of her privacy we'll call Karen (why the heck not), started an anime club. Yup, weebs. Great. She starts this club, and gets quite a few members. There's this one boy in particular. We'll call him Joe.  Why not. Joe was a constant at this anime club, the only kid who showed up every day. Karen said she liked him, even though he was a little weird with the whole waifu thing. I went one time, because she asked me to and, hey, I'm not a weeb but I am her friend. So I went ahead and went. Joe stared at me. The. Whole. Damn. Time. Not once did he take his eyes off me. And, not to be mean, but Joe was not easy on the eyes. And he's past the point of chubby. He's morbidly obese and breathes super loud and annoyingly.Any who, afterwards Karen tells me that Joe has a crush on me. Like, a huge crush. Most girls in my community have flat chests, and I am an exception to the rule. And he watches anime, so when you put two and two together you get he likes my DDs. I wasn't really uncomfortable. I figured it was normal for boys to have crushes on girls, so I just ignored it.Later, Eric and I went out to a concert. My city has a lot of free concerts at night, so we went ahead and went to one. We didn't have anything better to do. Now mind you, our relationship is kinda...weird. He's gay, so it's not really so weird for us. It's little things, like holding hands or feeding each other stuff or sitting on each other's laps. He owns so many pride shirts it's all he ever wears, so most people realize he's gay and that we're just friends.Either way, there was funnel cake at this concert, so we bought some and started feeding each other. Just then, the entire fricking anime club just rolls up and is like "can we sit with the cool kids". I didn't really want them all to, since some where cosplaying and role playing and just being weird in general. I'm an ass, so I told Karen she could sit with me and and the only three kids that seemed any sort of normal. The rest just kind of had to leave. I almost felt bad. But then again, I am a cunt. Anyway, we all were sitting there, talking, and Eric is still feeding me cake. The Joe kid is making this weird face at us the whole time."Are you guys dating?" he finally asked."No, he's literally wearing a pride shirt." I gestured to the HUGE fricking rainbow on Eric's shirt. He just nodded, and we continued as normal. Later, we were getting ready to leave and standing by the car (Eric is old enough to drive). Joe walks past me and stops for just a second."You two would be a cute couple." he whispers. I jump a little, because that's weird af. And then he just walks away. I'm like, okay, what the hell. But it's whatever.Skip ahead a few days. I haven't heard from Karen in a while. Eric and I have been hanging out a little more often. We're in his basement playing Mario Kart, when we hear a knock at the door. Eric goes and gets it, I sit down there and wait. I wait 45 minutes before he comes back, and he looks uncomfortable as hell."Why are you making that face?" I asked him."Some kid showed up. Says his name is...Joe. And he was looking for you. He literally stood in the rain and begged to come play Mario Kart with us. But I don't know him, so I didn't let him in. Do you know him?" I was, to say the least, freaked out. How did he know where I was, and how did he know I was here right now? I realized that I had posted a few minutes before about being at Eric's house, it was a selfie. We were outside. And before then, I was in the car on the way. But my location was off, so how...Then I saw. You could just barely see the street sign in the picture in the car, and his address in the selfie by his front door. This kid searched HARD for these clues and learned his address. We were freaked out. He practically STALKED me. I called Karen later and told her what happened. She told me that he did, in fact, ship me and Eric. He'd been making it a big deal for the past few days. Weirder and weirder.When I went back to Eric's house a few days later, he was so uncomfortable and nervous he was literally white."Listen, Kai, I have to show this shit." He went to his room and handed me a piece of paper. There was art. Of us. Me and Eric. HAVING FUCKING SEX. And it was *detailed.* I mean, detailed as f u c k. And it was signed with the kid's name."Where the hell did this come from?" I asked him."It was taped to my front door!" he replied. We both freaked out. "Okay, we're hanging out at my house now. Not your house." I told him.This story is pretty long so we're gonna reach the climax now. Eric and I went shopping earlier today. We were at Target, and I kept seeing this green shirt out the corner of my eyes. But I never see it directly. Eric and I were holding hands, mind you. Finally, we reach the snack aisle, and we both look to our right at the same time. Joe is standing there taking video of us. Holding hands. To make a long story short, we wound up having to call the police and the kid got juvie for sexual harassment and stalking.

Because let me tell you, mine is pretty tame compared to some of you guys'. Okay so it was October of 2016, everybody was going crazy about them killer clowns. So what did we do? Flip out of course. One day a clown was spotted on school grounds before school. Now beforehand we were all making jokes about it, like slamming out lunches together yelling, "it would be a shame if we were to get kidnapped right now!! " But now that there was an actual clown, we were prepared. We freshly sharpened pencils, water bottles filled with rocks, and students running on a solid 2 hours of sleep. The insomniacs and depressed kids, like me were the top fighters. We weren't afraid to die and we also were a bit out of it, because of the little sleep we got. There weren't a lot of us, but the few of us who there were, well, we were some of the largest, tallest, strongest and fastest students in school. Not to mention we were pretty jumpy and ready to take hits. Now I know this was a stretch, but most students here were deathly afraid of clowns. So naturally, we were all prepared. The second fighters were the students who were born and raised in Florida, and that was a lot. They were the second wave if the clown came back. They brought only the weirdest contributions. One student brought a centipede with a sharp pencil on its back. Then the Kyle's, they really only brought lots of monster energy and always had some lovely caffeine and sugar before school. Then, finally, the pussies. They didn't fight, they instead made the so called "weapons." They were pretty creative sometimes. But yeah the clown didn't come and we all got very angry. Then came the Harambe jokes.

In high school I was a teachers aid for 1st period.  I helped out a Home Economics teacher. Basically I typed tests, graded them and sometimes cleaned the kitchen students used. One day I�m typing up tests and the teacher tells me about this student that is coming in. She said she is awful, cussed up a storm, doesn�t come to class but will walk by the classroom and doesn�t do her work, apparently she does this with all the teachers and she also cussed out this teacher. She said she would be coming in that morning with her mother because she was suspended and apparently the mom wanted to talk to her. I thought oh boy prepare for entitled mom yelling. So finally the girl and her mom show up but it�s really odd, the mom is super quiet and the daughter did most of the talking. The teacher asked what she was going to do for punishment. The mom said she was not going to let her leave the house. The daughter then yells �Fine by me! I�ll just watch TV and eat and drink soda all day!�, the teacher then replied � You need to not allow her to watch TV or use anything entertaining as punishment�, the daughter steps in between the teacher and mom and says �shut up! I�ll do what I want, you can�t tell my mom what to do because she will give in to me anyway�. I was like damn this kid needs a whooping. I looked and the mom looks defeated and doesn�t say much. After some back and forth arguing between the teacher and daughter the daughter suddenly says �whatever! Mom lets go!� She then pulls on her mom and drags her out of the room and they leave. The teacher and I just look at each other like wtf just happened? Like is it possible for a child to abuse a parent?!

Alrighty so this was back in sophomore year of high school, English 10. My teacher (Mr. S) was notoriously weird and kinda a sad boi. He never married and his best friend was his really old beagle. He was also the announcer at our football games and until I had his class I thought it was just a weird voice he did for the games (it wasn�t) Mr.S was a massive guy booming voice and weird. 3 very important factsMiddle of the year ish and we have a paper due in like 2 days. For some reason we�re talking about the details of someone�s paper in front of the whole class and at some point it came up they had used personal pronouns throughout the entire essay. Anyone who�s ever written an essay knows this is a big no no and you kinda gotta be dumb to do it. He basically just said she needed to change those bits to get rid of the pronouns and she had a meltdownThe exchange went as followsDummy (d for short) - �Mr.S can I just keep the pronouns? because it�s due in like 2 days and I don�t want to have to redo the whole thing�Mr. S - �No sorry you�ll have to fix those, but it shouldn�t be too hard because you just have to fix some words here and there.�D - �NO! I�LL HAVE TO REDO ALL IF IT!�He�s kinda shook by her outburst but try�s to remain calmMr. S - �no no it�ll be fine just swap �you� for �one� and �I� for �some� you�ll be fine� He�s totally reasonable She is not. D - �OMG (she said that out loud) I CANT BELIEVE THIS�D is now on the verge of tearsMr. S gets a �this bitch� look on his faceMr. S �Quit your whining!�D - �I�m not whining!�Mr. S �iM nOt wHiNiNiG�He said that in a second grade playground mockery tone and the whole class went silent. My friend and I are just trying to hold back the laughter when D stands up CRYING and runs out the door screaming �I HATE THIS CLASS! IM GOING TO THE OFFICE!�He then leaned out the door to yell to her running down the hall� Yeah? Does someone need to go with you?� And then he locked himself in the back room leaving all of us in stunned silence.

A few years ago I went to the beach with my family. It was high tide, and lifeguards were even prohibiting people under a certain age from entering the water. It was a VERY foggy day.          The waves were decently sized, but they came in FAST. So, being the careless idiot that I still am, decided to enter the water at my own leisure. Waves weren�t too bad, jumped a few, dunked under a few big ones, nothing too bad. Then as ironic as it sounds, I turn around and all these people are gathering in front of my area on the sand, my family was shouting at me to come back.          I turn around and there was a humongous wave, roughly 15 ft high. I tried running, but the wave caught up to me and took me under. Sand and water got into my nose and eyes, and I was being flipped over and pulled away from the beach. It was about 30 seconds before I resurfaced into the fog. I could barely stay afloat, but I managed to see the faint silhouettes of the people still gathered at the beach.         I felt something slight against my leg so I frantically doggie paddles back to land. Thankfully, I soon heard the motor of a lifeguard�s jet ski and was safely back at shore minutes later. I might have also had somewhat of a mental breakdown while trying desperately to stay afloat.

Albert woke with a dull pain in his chest, alone, in the Walmart bathroom?Propping himself up on his elbows, Albert looked around. �Yep... I�m in a Walmart bathroom...� he thought.Slowly pulling himself up, confusion mixed with an odd feeling in his feet and hands. Looking down, Albert�s eyes grew wide; he wouldn't see his feet, but he could see his hands, and they were glowing. Faint orange light left trails in the air as he moved them about. �I�m dead... Or maybe I�ve gone mad...� he thought, panic rising. �I have to get out of here!� the instant his hands hit the door, the lights flickered, and a feeling of weightlessness hit him. The bathroom changing, still a bathroom, just less well maintained.Albert pulled his hands back, eyeing his new surroundings. Then he elbowed the door open; this time, everything stayed the same.He was in a southern bar. �Hey! Were closed, you have to leave.� said a man behind the bar.�... Sorry, I just... Got lost...� quickly hiding his hands behind his back. �Well, you can't stay here...� eyeing him, �Hey... What are you hiding behind your back?� �Nothing!� quickly making his way to the door.�No! Get back here!� moving around the bar, toward the door to block it. �You steal something?!� he accused. �No! I swear! I didn't take anything from your-...� the bar flickered, the feeling of weightlessness. Albert looked down, his hand on a gas station door. He jerked his hand back, sticking them into his pockets. To the amusement of the late-night clerk, Albert spent four full minutes using his foot to open the door before informing him.�The doors locked. You want to go through those doors.� pointing at another set of doors.�Were you just standing there? This entire time?� �Yeah!� he said energetically, �Oh common!... Don't look like that; it's dull working the night shift! You're the most entertaining thing since the tv broke.� The clerk gets an even bigger smile on his face. �Oh!... Dude... I think I got you on camera! Hold on leg me check!� runs into a backroom. �Wait! On camera!� Albert looked up into the security camera�s lens. �... Oh... No... God no! F**k!� �Whoa!... You some kind of ghost?! You just appeared-� Albert deliberately slammed his hand onto the door; the gas station flickered; he felt weightlessness. Then he was standing outside a restaurant. Quickly running into an alleyway, then pulling his glowing hands out to glare at them.�What the f**k is wrong with you!� as expected, no response. �... Look at me... I�m going mad... I�m talking to my f**king hands in some alleyway for heaven's sake...� as if in response, his hands faded. �No! No, no, no! Don't go away! How am I supposed to go home! I don't even know where I am!� the odd feeling in his hands and feet drained. Albert ran to a door, an apartment complex, putting his hand on the door, to no effect. He stood there, just pulling his hand back and putting it back on the door.

Ironic. We all knew what was going to happen. We all were trained for this. Funny how humans are, you know? Here at the edge of the solar system there is not much on a human scale. God knows how we survived. Anyways I am the only one remaining. Psycho-analysis says i am bored. Not much of a surprised. For the sake of curiousity we came. Now its all gone. The WanderLust is not maintained( i am no mech), reserves are getting short. That detour to Io....All because of that. We should have gone back. But no, we went ahead. First it was the captain. Then the mech. Next came accidents. Newton shut off. The pilot went mad and we lost the back module. [Beep beep beep]. Oh for the love of..oxygen is going down. No energy to radio. Earth probably thinks we died long ago. Hmmmm.... it was nice while it lasted i guess...(sighs heavily) And thus the last cereal has entered into the abyss. Sixty days if my predicition is right. Sixty days till this piece of stardust finally collapses. Too bad i could not say anything to anyone on Earth. {Oxygen Levels at Dangerous Levels. Please Wear Safety Space..S...uuu...iitt} Well i guess this it..If anyone finds this, remember us. Please don't forget us. I have recorded this in similar fashion as the pioneer disks. I have rigged up a small engine to send  our data back to Earth when the WanderLust dies. I hope-----

We aren't quite twins. If you were to look between me and her, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. At least, not unless you were really Looking. That's how good the plastic surgeon was. Find someone who resembles the target enough, and a good plastic surgeon can make that resemblance into a mirror.That's what it's like, standing in the same room with her. It's like looking into a mirror. When I was learning how to mimic her mannerisms - the way she stands, the way she talks, the hand gestures and facial expressions she expects me to use while under the Public Eye - it really was like a mirror, albeit with a reflection that's a few seconds delayed. She did a motion, I would mimic it, and our handlers would critique my mimicry.Took some getting used to.So when I say we're not quite twins, it's because although we look identical, we aren't related; we aren't from the same mother; and of the two of us, she's the one with the real identity. I'm just a mimic, literally made to go to the public functions she doesn't care to attend. They say it's a question of security, but I'm starting to think it's more a question of convenience. Did you know, Free Thinkers can't be killed unless enough of their brethren vote for it? Free Thinkers love voting more than life itself.I'm more of an object than a person, at least in the eyes of the political elite... And when you're caught under that gaze, is there any other opinion that matters?(The right answer to that question is yes, of course there are other opinions that matter, but it's easy to get lost in the maze during your own pursuit of power. It's easy to be caught by the minotaur, and only those who know better than to give power to the beast manage to get away clean.)As far as my real life is concerned, I died in a car crash. The car crash really happened, and the funeral, and the mourning... But the dying was a sham. I woke up in a sterile hospital room far from home, chosen only because I happened to resemble America's First Lady. Taken out of the frying pan and flung into the fire, and I leapt in hands first like the greedy wretch I am.Given the choice between being dead or being treated like an American princess for the rest of my life, it seemed like the thing to do. Little did I know what the life of an American princess is really like, or how much worse it is to be the body double of such a woman... Ever hear about whipping boys? My life is the modern day version of that.There's proof of body doubles for the political elite in popular culture all over the place. That's the way Free Thinkers like to operate: they hide the truth in plain sight, with little sneering smiles and gay laughs, because of course the general population are too Blind to See the truth. Ever hear Michael of The Office refer to the Obama twins? How about an Obama fashion show? That's a giant joke in all directions, especially if you're familiar with the conspiracy theory that says Michelle Obama is actually a man named Michael. The real Michelle Obama is as woman as they come, but there's a reason that most of her mirrors are men.(Jealousy. Jealousy is the reason. Michelle Obama doesn't like her husband looking at other women, even when those women are made to look exactly like her.)The fashion show thing is actually more devastating than it seems. All of the political elite like to throw weird, mind fuckery parties every now and then, using their body doubles as... Well, models. Some of them even participate in the fashion show themselves, with a game not unlike picking a needle out of a haystack. Bid on the right Obama, and you take the real thing home for a night! Everyone else gets the consolation prize -- and let me tell you, I hate being the consolation prize.(Then again, all fashion shows are more devastating than they seem. When someone with enough money and power is bidding on an outfit worn by a model, they're not only buying the clothes.)I learned lots of things before my surgery. Once you die the first time, it doesn't really matter anymore; dying, even when it's pretend, means you've lost your chance to figure things out Blind, which apparently unlocks some sort of proverbial door that can only be opened from that side. But I've heard the Catalyst Game is rigged, anyway, just like every other modern day sports game out there. You only win if you're meant to. That's the problem with Free Thinkers, I guess.They put me on a pill that was supposed to jumpstart the learning capabilities in my brain, but no one warned me how addictive it would be. It's gotten to the point where I can barely care for my basic needs without my regular dose; like I learned how to learn on the pill, and forgot how to live once it's taken away. They've made me go through withdrawals just so I'll learn what it's like... Preemptive preventative motions, it's called.To me, it feels more like torture. Once you're on the pill, you stop feeling like a human after you're taken off it -- and when you're on the pill, you feel infinitely better than anything else you've ever known. Another trap, wrapped up in a pretty bow and given to you by someone wearing a predatory smile.Wolves aren't the only ones who dress up in sheep's clothes. � 2019 and beyond.

After a history test at school, my schoolmate told me that he had copied everything from the book and that he would take the maximum grade. A few days later they gave us the test and he took a bad grade because the teacher knows that he had cheated. in one sentence he wrote: "........... as we will see better in the next chapter"True story



******************************



   So it's nearing the end of the school year, all big tests are over and all we are doing now is going from class to class mindlessly doing busy work. Come computer class and we are doing our usually boring 10 minutes of typing then a quiz over internet safety or something (I don't remember this was like 2 years ago) when I get an idea; you see our school is poor and rich at the same time, meaning that they spend thousands on teacher amenities each year, but shrivle up when it comes to computers and computer networking (will come into play later). Now my idea was to go to a website I knew that had a 1.5.2 copy version of Minecraft free to download and it was miraculously unblocked by my school's network.    I downloaded it and start playing when a few students ask where I got it, I give them the website they download and play rinse and repeat. Eventually the teacher caught on and had the website blocked, but we still had our copies (here's where computer networking comes into play). They ALSO did not restrict students from accessing the big school drive where teachers would dump their lessons plans and stuff; so I made around a thousand copies of Minecraft, renamed them, and dumbed them into every file I could find. And it worked, everyone found a copy and started playing, and to this day (according to my friends who haven't graduated yet) they still haven't erradicated all the copies and students keep making more. So yeah, I basically infested the school computer network with Minecraft.

What if I told you vampires are real? No, not the sexy kind. I mean the horrendous creatures that hide in the darkest reaches of a room. The kind that jump out and hiss with a screeching tone, grabbing you by the shoulder and head with their pale, wrinkly hands. Then moving their dexterous, long and bony hands around your neck, looking for the main artery leading to your brain.They don't drink blood though, they drink memories. They leech the very thoughts out of your mind, and retreat back to the black depths of the shadows. This is why there are no pictures of them. Like I said, they drink memories. With that information, let me ask you this; Have you ever walked into a room and forgot why you went in?

This is a funny story now that I look back at it. I haven't told anyone the full story cause it makes me look.. Well stupid but I'm all for making people laugh so here we go it's pretty long so get the popcorn! Backstory:We met a week after 9th grade started I was 15 and she was 14.. The first day I saw her she wore a black sweater with gray sweat pants and the original chucks Taylors.. We had a mutual friend (we'll call him Steve) me and steve were chatting it up when she comes over. I immediately get stuck un sure of what to say. I only had one girlfriend before and that ended in a train wreck. She pulled her phone out to show Steve something after that set it down by him.. While he wasn't looking I took her phone and texted myself (it's weird I'm sorry) so I texted it back with my name. She looked at it.. Looked at me.. Looks at her phone again then asks "did you put your number in my phone and text yourself"? I immediately felt shame but she surprised me when she said.. Boss move that's cute and smiled at me..That smile made my heart sink something I never felt before. I didn't know what to do after that so I played it cool texting her every now and then (I didn't know the rules..) but one day I was having a crappy day. I was on the bus when she texted me asking if I was okay she seen I was bummed out all day but didn't want to bother me. That's when I knew. We texted throughout the summer.She traveled a lot that summer so we didn't really text or talk that much. This was actually one of the conversations we had she didn't want to hurt me because she traveled alot.. But I didn't care I had gotten a job at the airport after my birthday so I was making money and talking to a pretty girl I thought I had it made for 16.10th grade. Starts we didn't have any classes together I was bummed but I knew it was better so I could focus. We had the same lunch period though I was excited about that. We ate lunch together and talked some more and found out that we have the same birthday. So me trying to be romantic I asked her for a date and she said yes.. I was so excited that I skipped school a couple days to work some extra shift in the morning plus my regular shifts at night so I was at the airport from 10am to 10pm. I saved up a good 300 dollars for my date. And blew it all on her at the mall.. I didn't care I'd do it again.. That day she called me and we talked on the phone for hours and ended up asking her to be my girlfriend. She said yes. Was happy and we hung out every chance we got. Fast forward to the beginning of 11th grade year. Everything started  off great we have a class together too! We're sitting together when a new guy walks in.About 5'8 tall dark and handsome we'll call him Joe. Joe wasn't what you expected. Turns out he was a nerdy guy. I didn't think anything of it. He sits by us and introduces himself to us. We talk until class starts. End of story right? Boy was I wrong.Valentines day is coming up so I wanted to plan something nice but when I brung up some ideas and she wasn't feeling any of it. (Which was my plan) to which I said I'll just surprise you. She got happy. The next day she calls me and wanted to ask me a question about Joe. I still didn't think anything of it. She wanted me to give him tips on how to talk to women. Do you know how much confidence that gave me? So I did. I told the normal stuff that I was taught. Be yourself make her laugh ect ect. I asked so who is the lucky girl bro? He replied with its Joan from my math class. I said I hope it works out bro. V-Day is here and I was happy cause it was Saturday and I was off from work. I went and bought her favorite chocolate some flowers and a teddy bear. A big one. Like really fucking big. I'm 5'3 and it was bigger than me. Anyway I go to her house and give her all the stuff I bought. She started crying. I thought it was tears if joy because she kissed me. We spent an hour. Watching TV when I realized we had to go to the movies soon. And I told her to get ready. This is the whole conversation that went down. Me:hey what time is it? Her:12:30Me:go get ready we're going to the movies.Her:what!? Really okay! (She's been dying to see a caption america movie) Me:hey have you seen my phone!?Her: no call it from mine. As soon as I went to pick it up a text came through that said "I can't wait to see you tonight. The last time was fun" after I seen that my heart was in my throat and I was stuck for a minute until she came back down. Her:hey I found your phone you lef... What's wrong? I tossed the phone to her. Me:tell Joe I said heyHer:I'm so sorry I couldn't really talk at this moment. I didn't feel anything. Her:say something please! I left to go to the porch and she followed. I'm sitting on the railway of her steps dumbfounded. I went back inside to grab my stuff and leave. She followed me and kinda pushed me onto the couch. I tried getting up without saying a word but she kept doing it until I gave up. Me:just tell me whyHer:I don't know what to say. Me: the truth would be a great start. (How wrong I was) Her:I don't like labels. Me:what? Her:I don't like being tied down. Me:so you cheated? Why not just break up with me if you wasn't happy. This fucked me up. Her:your bad at sexMe:.... Her:I miss you all the time. Me: so you cheated because I work and don't like to slap you around?  (she was into bdsm I wasn't comfortable with that) I left after that didn't even try to talk to her and avoided her as much as possible. About a month later Joe comes up to me we with a peice of paper and also apologized.. I was confused. I opened it it was HIS Facebook account info. I looked him up and messaged himMe:why did you give me this? The fuck do you want anyway? Joe:I wanted to explain that she told me you guys were broken up. She started flirting. Me:bullshit. Later on that night I decided to look for myself and it turns out she did. I was so pissed I pretty much died inside that day.A few months go by and I hear a rumor that she's pregnant and she's keeping it because they are together.. I didn't want to be around for any of that do I switched to the online portion of school they offered since I only had a year left and I wanted to work more. So it worked out. I ran into her a few months ago and it turns out they got engaged. She since then apologized for the stuff she said. She said it was because she was young and stupid. I accepted her apology and went on my way. I found a wedding invitation in my mailbox for next year.. On my birthday.  I haven't really had a relationship since then I dated here and there but no luck.. Now I just work and play video games. I apologize for any errors you find and hope you enjoy it.

Some years ago my cousins came to our state to visit family, upon meeting them at the airport we immediately had noticed they have picking scabs and missing teeth on top of being severely underweight.We gace them the benefit of the doubt and let them stay with us inside our living room and shed renovated into a guest house.We previously had an experience with my cousins husband who was caught burning our spoon to smoke his painkillers, my cousin quickly began to defend him because he suffered a traumatic brain injury (later found out it was because he was tweaking and ran into traffic) and that smoking them was the only way he could get the pain killers to work. They also had left a lot of dirty lingerie in my aunts room where they had been staying, poor aunt. As they stayed at our house for the few weeks it was supposed to be her husband snorted crushed up pills infront of me a young teen at the time and my aunt told me he was handing out his adderall to his wife and her like candy.(For the sake of efficiency we will call my cousins husband shane and my cousin carly and the child jj)While shane and carly were out one day we needed to change the jj's diaper. We grabbed the diaper bag and found a bundle of napkins wrapped up into a ball next to the childs formula, inside of the ball was a pill bottle with the label scraped off except for the last parts of their towns location. Inside of it was this fine glossy black powder which upon inspection we assumed was fentanyl. We quickly contacted the police and tried to find any sanitized baby supplies for jj. The police came and tested the substance, luckily it was not fentanyl (i say luckily because this amount could easy have killed my entire block) but was dirty methamphetamine. Biker meth they called it, made from methylamine rather than pseudoephedrine (same chemical walter white used in breaking bad only this was extremely less pure) they could not confirm that this was their property and confiscated the substance but told us to contact CPS to investigate them. We go to the motel they had been staying at for their "couple time" and CPS sent a couple officers out to test them for the drug.They weren't there, turned out they had signed out about an hour beforehand with no transportation.We drice around town looking for them when we eventually see around 4 police SUV's at a walmart. They had been tweaking so bad that numerous people had called 911 to alert them that my cousins were severely intoxicated and possibly dangerous to the public. Some cross calls were made and CPS found out that they were who we called about, before this however we talked to one of the officers on scene and found out thst it was shane and carly. They were taken and put into a detox chamber after they were given a mouth swab to check for any orally consumed drugs.We lost contact with them for 2 days but eventually I found out carly tested positive for THC and methamphetamine. Shane on the otherhand was an off and on meth head and had only been abusing adderall and ritalin at that time. So he was released while carly was held for a few days while they decided what process they would take for her as she was from a different state and was not in possession of narcotics, only had recently used them.This loophole is what made them untouchable not only by CPS but by the police as well, she was released quickly after and we were forced to hand over the child as they went back to indiana from my state. My family was devastated as we were seeing this childa last hope for a functional family and upbringing be ripled away by shanes upper class enabling parents and carly's emotional manipulation of shane.Side notes to the story:Shane and carly would mix coffee creamer in the jj's formula giving him anal scours and intense digestional problems, and many other forms of neglect on this child.I just needed to tell this story, i appreciate everyone who takes the time to read this.

My parents allowed me to tag along with my uncle and his stepson while they did some delivery jobs in a city over. Figured the exposure to work early (I was in either 2nd or 3rd grade) would do me some good. Mom gave me some money so that my uncle didn't have to pay for my food. At any rate, we ended up going to a Taco Bell. My uncle and his stepson went up to order first. I remember them both looking at the menu talking over what to order. My uncle's stepson says he'll get a burrito. That's when my uncle kind of chuckled and cautioned him, "are you sure? Those things are very dangerous." I was super young and took things very literally. Danny (the stepson) didn't laugh back, and just confirmed that he is going to eat the burrito. I was terrified. I imagined Danny blowing up or vomiting his insides after eating the burrito. I envisioned super important people making a burrito and accidentally making it wrong such that a bad reaction would ensue. I wanted so badly to beg that he not show off...you don't need to look cool...just get some tacos and nachos. But I didn't want to look like a pussy, so I just kept my distance while watching Danny eat a burrito. My uncle's immature comments kept coming, and I kept fearing for Danny's life.Growing up, I occasionally heard people talking about how they like burritos from this place or the other. I instantly thought that they were just insecure people trying to show off that they can eat a dangerously prepared dish. Then one day my mom orders a burrito. I'm a freshman in college. I tell my family my reservations with burritos and why. They all laugh. Years later...I've had my fair share of burritos now.

So, about a year back, I  was sent to the office, because the vice principal and principal wanted to question me. I had done nothing prior to this, so it really confused me. When I got to the office, they told me, that someone had seen a picture of a gun on my facebook, and was scared that I was a potential school shooter. They then asked me to give them my facebook password, so that they could investigate my page, to see if there was anything wrong. I said no, because I did not want to give my password to anybody, except those I trust most. During the same day, there was a walk out to protest gun violence in the U.S, so I left for the walkout. After leaving, the vice principal called the cops, because he thought i was going to shoot up the school. Later that night, a detective came to my house, asking to search it. We asked if they had a warrant, and they said no. They came back an hour later with a warrant. After searching through the entire house, and finding nothing, the detective gave me and my family an apology, but said she had to check my facebook anyways. Since she was a cop, and I didn't want to go to jail, I gave her a download of my profile, and she again, found nothing. Several months later, while my parents were partying across the state, me and my brother were home alone. It was 1 in the morning, and he had already gone to bed. I was laying awake in my bed, when someone started to pound on my window, yelling "You're house is on fire!". I woke up my brother, put on some pajamas, and rushed outside, seeing that half of my house was engulfed in flame. The people who banged on my window said that they had seen someone drive up to my house, remove the skirting, and toss something on fire under there. When the fire department and cops arrived, we found a sign with cutout letters posted in front of my shed, making threats against me and my family if we continued living in the school district. To this day, the police have not caught whoever lit my house on fire.

I work at McDonald's. The way I get through the nights is by pretending I'm going to rob it. Just fyi I'm not going to and I dont plan on it. But I pretend to. I watch what the other workers do and how they act. There is this girl I don't like and I pretend like she knows what I'm planning so she is another obstacle. That's how I get through my nights.

We never made it to Florida. She�d been nodded out until we got to northern Alabama. Once we stopped there, she made me buy obscene amounts of candy and soda. She also asked me to check the oil when I put gas in, but she stayed in the car. There was barely any oil on the dipstick. What was there was black like coffee left on a hot pot all day. It looked chunky. I said,�Yeah. It looks great, baby,� from under the hood. I was about finished with her anyway. I could feel the monster trying to claw himself free from the box inside of my brain. She wouldn�t fair well, if he got out, and she pulled the things she did. Anyway, it wouldn�t matter once I got away from her whether the car was had oil or not. That would be her problem.  After driving 13 hours Gabriella and I spent the night in a hotel on the coast of Alabama. I rented the room at the office and opened it for her. The day had gone well. Of course, there was the typical bickering. She was always good for that. In the room, there wasn�t much heroin left, and since I hadn�t gotten a habit going since I relapsed with her, I let her have it. I was just happy to be out of Ohio where no one was watching the news that offered a reward for information leading to my arrest. The blue and green flicker of the TV glowed through the curtains in our room. I sat on the beach in the moonlight and listened to the surf breaking on the sand and thought about Oregon and Arizona. I had never been to either state and both had cities where the street life was happening, or so I�d heard. Arizona would be warmer and drier. Oregon had a certain pull on me, even though it would be wet and cold. It was a place I�d wanted to go since I was a kid. Both had plenty of heroin according to all reports I ever got.The prospect of leaving her and going back to the streets put a warm lump of hope or nostalgia or something sentimental, and I walked back to the room. She was sleeping when I opened the door. A movie played on HBO. I fell asleep quickly.Now, I don�t know where she got the clothes iron, but she did. She may have brought it. It may have been a part of the room. I�m not sure about where it came from. I just know that the distinct sound of my own skin�s moisture popping against the hot metal held to my forehead woke me up that morning. Gabriella was up. We had no connections in Alabama. I�d lied about Florida. So, she burned me with the iron. I can�t say it wasn�t expected, or at least something like it.I pulled my pants on. I ran for the door. Rain fell in freezing drops the size of grapes from the sky and a wind ripped up the street as I walked faster. Everything with her and leaving my sister and being so weak caught up to me, and as hard as I fought it, I cried. I bawled in the rain walking down the street in just my jeans. A car pulled up behind me and then slowly creeped along with me. Maybe they would help. Maybe they�d have an answer or ask me to get in and take me far away from my life and myself and everything else I hated so much and couldn�t figure out, but when I turned towards them, a middle-aged man with a crew cut leaned over the steering wheel to see past his wife, who was gawking from the passenger seat. A child pointed and smiled from the back. I moaned pathetically and reached out towards them and stumbled to put my face to the window and beg for their help.  It was as if I could sense their humanity bubbling up within their chests so that they would, so that they must help this pitiful, half naked creature crying like a child in the freezing rain -- me. My senses must have been wrong, though. The mother reached back to hide the child�s eyes from seeing me, and the engine revved. Tail pipe blasted smog at my face. Tires splashed cold gutter water all over me. I cried harder and decided to walk back to the hotel. At least there, I would be able to sit on the balcony outside of the room where it was dry. Maybe Gabriella would let me in. The curtains were closed. The lights were off from what I could tell. It looked like no one was in the room when I got back. I leaned over the railing and let my tear drops fall to the pavement below. A one-story drop wouldn�t even break my legs, maybe sprain an ankle, but there was no way I could expect the fall to kill me. Then, I looked towards the sea. I�ve never been a very good swimmer. The storm had caused the waves to break violently against the shore. All I would have to do is swim towards the horizon for as long as I could. There was no way I would be able to make it back. Before I could make the stairs, a pair of young black men wearing torn white tshirts on their heads like bandanas met me as they were coming out of their room. They took one look at me and asked,�Whatsa poblem? Why you cryin�? You a mon. Don� cry.�They asked me if I was a �Jesus person.� They asked me if I liked �da Boy.� Both questions confused me, but soon I got it figured out. The answers were no and yes respectively.I said, �No. Not a Jesus person. Yes. I like da boy.��Come in. You have money.� I think it was a question, like he was asking if I had money. It just didn�t sound like one. And I did have money.In the room, they sat me in a chair at the small table against the wall and produced a brittle, brown brick the size of a wallet. They cut a bit off and put it on the table. I couldn�t even see what they�d given me, but I trusted it was there and put my nose to it and snorted. My eyes watered. I got queasy. �You like dat mon.� It was supposed to be another question. I nodded and stumbled towards the door and puked over the balcony. They didn�t ask for any money. They just said they�d be there if I wanted more. I woke up covered in the white beach sand grit. An angry Gabriella was standing over me. It was getting dark and had quit raining at some point. All I could remember, though, were the two Jamaicans or Haitians or whoever they were pulling me into their room. Gabriella said I needed to go pay for another night. She�d been locked out and looking for me all day, so she said. I could tell by her voice that she�d gotten something somewhere. Maybe all the dope she didn�t do or share with me from the day before. I don�t know. The next morning started off better. It was sunny and warmer. She didn�t wake me up by burning the skin off my face or turned any other appliances into medieval torture devices. She hadn�t started a fight, even. We went to breakfast at a diner down the street. I wore a pair of cheap aviators I�d stolen from a gas station a few days before. In my mind, somehow, the glasses were a disguise to keep people from noticing the piece of burned flesh on my forehead, hanging off like a gnarly piece of dried out pepperoni, all curled up and black and green and crusty. It didn�t work. The glasses only covered my eyes. I knew that. The waitress and anyone else who saw me that morning did a double take and stared awkwardly at it when they talked to me. A fatter man and his pretty wife at another table gave me a look of understanding, like he knew exactly what had happened when he saw it. It made me feel better though, to wear the glasses. So, I did. When we got back to the room, the two men I�d seen the day before were standing outside of the room. Gabriella was wearing those gym shorts that must have belonged to a skinny 8th grader, and they choked her thighs and butt that made it hard for men not to look. One man slapped the other�s shoulder and pointed at her as we entered the room. Inside of the room, she asked me what we where we could score.         �I know you were high yesterday, Clyde.�I told her to wait in the room and went back to the other room. The two men were standing outside waiting for me. There were 50 bucks left in my pocket, and they gave me a generous portion of the fuzzy looking granules in three gel caps for it. That was the last of the money. �Hey, mon, we like you chick.��You just don�t know here well enough, then, mon.� I laughed, trying to do my best islander accent. They didn�t understand. �We pay. We take her. Our boat comes at sunrise, tomorrow.� They didn�t want her for the night. I�d never had a chick like that long enough to let one pay for our dope that way anyway, but they wanted something more permanent. �Let me think about it. I�ll come see you later.�The truth is that I would have never sold Gabriella to the Haitians or Jamaicans or whatever they were. She was terrible to me. The last two or three days, though, were good. Well, they were okay, and you�d have to forget about the incident with the iron to say that. Something inside of me loved her still. Something inside of me wanted to make it work with her and held onto the moments when she was just a little less crappy than others so that it could work. Maybe, I was just weak. Anyone else would have left her. I never would have. There�s no question about it, but Boom Boom on the other hand, well, that he�s a different story. She did most of the dope in the capsules. I only did a little and got sick. Gabriella woke me up in the middle of the night. She was naked and sweet and sweating soon after that. We had fun. We shared a cigarette in bed, glistening in the dark and blew smoke at the ceiling. She started a shower. *This was it.* I thought. *This was love.* She was not who she�d been, really. I�d finally found it, the thing called love, that I�d so desperately pined for. My mother was all I had ever known of it, and she was gone. A warm spring of hope and happiness babbled in my chest. Angels were singing. This was love, but in the shower, she farted in my mouth, again. She even laughed, like it was cute.Now, it�s always difficult explaining the whole Boom Boom thing to people, because obviously, he and I exist in the same body. It�s just not clear exactly where the line is drawn. There are somethings about Clyde, that are the same about Boom Boom. So, maybe, it�s not necessarily two distinct personalities but severely altered versions of the same person. Like I said, it�s difficult to explain, and it�s also difficult to know exactly when the line is crossed from Clyde to Boom Boom or Boom Boom to Clyde. I just know it was some time after she farted in my mouth in the shower and laughed.She watched TV. I told her I�d be back with some more heroin and went to visit the men. They were up. The payment filled a cigarette cellophane so fully that when I melted it shut at the top with my lighter, some of the dope got melted into it. I wrapped it in a napkin for safety, deciding to revisit the packaging situation once Gabriella was gone.�Babes, look what they gave me!��WHAT! No way!��Yeah. The guys are just a few doors down. They say they want to meet you personally. I gotta take a dump, though, so just go on over. You�ll see �em. Their door is open.� Those were the last words I ever spoke to her. As the sun came up, I sat on the balcony. It was beautiful. I had walked to the 24-hour grocery store and bought a six pack of root beer in glass bottles. It was for the toast. You know, I would stick a needle in my veins with the most poisonous chemical concoctions you could dream up, if it would get me off, but I hated alcohol. Their door opened. It looked like Gabriella was lethargic from whatever drugs she�d done with them, but it was hard to tell. She had a pillowcase over her head and duct tape around her neck. Her hands were bound behind her back, and the men were strong besides. She didn�t give much fight physically, but for a few kicks here and there. I could hear her muffled screams. I imagined she was saying my name. There was a buzzing in the distance getting louder and closer all the time. Eventually, a rickety long boat made of what looked like trash pushed onto the shore from the water. The men took Gabriella, gagged and bound, over their shoulders and into the boat. I lifted my bottle of root beer to the men.  They waved back, and the driver let off his horn. That was our toast. I don�t know whatever happened to her. Maybe, she lives still in some Haitian rape dungeon. Maybe, she was chopped up into pieces and sold for the price of her organs. I don�t know. I don�t care, but I do know that I remembered that notebook with the stories in it, as the boat road off into the vast expanse of the see. It was in the car, so I went to get it. I opened it on the hood and let the sun warm my neck and head as I read the last story in it. My palms were on the car and fingers splayed. It was called, �I�ll never see that house again.� Whoever wrote it must have written it about their grandmother and her house. It went like this.*I�ll never see that house again.* *And I won�t see her either.**We spent every summer there and, in the mornings, she cooked pancakes in bacon grease from a mason jar or biscuits and sausage with strawberry preserves. We drank cold milk from the plastic cups from the shelf under her set of olive-green colony glass tea tumblers she�d had since the 1970s.**We watched cartoons with older cousins after breakfast or made tree forts anywhere on the five acres she kept sequestered from the new neighborhoods and traffic with trees and brush. There was a club house on the side of the garden in the field. It had windows and a door. It was where our uncle molested us.* *It was where my own father grew up, way back when the road was only one lane and made of gravel. He told me the front yard had been a dense, dark forest of cane when he was a kid. That was hard to believe. He told me the day he came home from the hospital, the pipes froze at the house and his head had been mangled by the forceps they used to deliver him. �I always wondered what my daddy thought that day,� he used to tell me, not that he remembered it, but he knew the story. �I always wondered what my daddy thought, coming home from the hospital, his son looking like some purple, smashed face monkey with a busted head and ice all over the kitchen floor.� Things had been different then.**My grandmother cut her own field until the day she broke her leg. She slipped on a clip from a clothes hanger at the department store looking for a deal. It was the end of her. Physical therapy had been too much. She never got out of the wheelchair. Eventually, one of her eyes went caddywompas�in her own words�meaning it went sideways while the other looked straight. We suspected it was from all the Tab she drank in the 1980s. Too much aspartame.**She was known to cry over nothing. Once she started weeping at the kitchen sink, because there was an airplane in the sky out the window and the people inside of it had just said goodbye to all the people they loved before boarding. Her face was as ugly as a face can get when it came to crying.* *She liked to say, �Well, ain�t that a bunch of sh\*t.� It usually was.* *She accused people of �flim flamming her.� They usually were.* *She accused the grandkids of always being one step ahead of her. We definitely were.**She used to sip Diet Coke from a glass and chew ice cubes or chewing a toothpick when she sat on her love seat next to a pile of outdated tabloids. She sowed all the curtains in the house, in the 60s. She told me how she�d set the kitchen on fire once and how the finish on the cabinets wasn�t the original. It had all been burned off in the fire.* *She died though. Rolled that wheel chair to the end of her long hallway, crawled into bed and died.* *Was it cold?* *Was she scared?* *Did she cry out or did something visit her when it happened?* *Now, her children are selling the property and house. It�s five acres. A strange redhaired couple with an Indonesian financer came to look at it. They wore collared shirts that had emblems of two triangles and the letter S running through them. The place will be sold to Scientologists. It will be one of their compounds.* *I can see her now, sitting on her love chair and looking up from the paper to say, �Ain�t that a bunch of sh\*t?�* *It is.**But I won't see that house again.**And I won't see her either.*When I finished the story, I turned around and fell back onto the hood of the car. A skinny blond woman in flip flops and shorts with a large, Fleur delis tattoo on her shoulder and a red skinned, kinky haired baby in her arms asked me for a cigarette. �Sure. They�re in my room, though. You�ll have to follow me.��K.� She waited outside of the door. Her eye was swollen shut and turning a shiny greenish black color. �Are you leaving town?� She asked.�Yeah.��Where you going?��Not sure.��Can you take me with you?��I think so.��Good. I need it. What�s your name anyway?��My name is�..� almost said Clyde, �You can call me Boom Boom.�

So, in the sixth grade I (pansexual genderqueer) was dating somebody else, let�s call her (also pansexual genderqueer) Ghost as she was super pale and that was a nickname of hers. She was depressed. Cutting, tired, sad, didn�t talk much, didn�t smile a whole lot. All those things. And my brain was indecisive in that year. Whenever I had dated somebody that year, something kept telling me to break up with them. So, I knew that was unhealthy and fucked up. It was bad for Ghost because she was already mentally unstable at that point, the fact that our relationship was on and off wasn�t helping. We broke up a couple (4) of times and when we had broken up, I dated other people. Whenever I saw her with somebody else I would get jealous, like somebody was telling me to get her back. Each time we broke up, whether it was because of me or her, I made sure I got her back. And one the last day of school I decided to break up with her. Let me give you some back story. I was the �crackhead� of my group, along with one other friend. It was like my job to keep everybody happy and laughing. I did that well, but not with Ghost. She didn�t laugh as much as you might expect from a middle schooler. Same with smiling. Sure she seemed happy with me, probably happier than she was with her ex as her ex was a manipulative b*tch. We didn�t have much contact outside of school, she didn�t have a phone number or anything, and I only had an iPad Pro at the time. We mostly were just the couple that only hung out at school. She never came over or stayed the night. And we constantly had to worry about teachers catching us doing something (at my school we weren�t even allowed to hug people, as that broke the rules of keeping your hands to yourself even if something was wrong). Anyway, Ghost is a shy person, doesn�t talk very much when around people she doesn�t know. She hides behind her hair (short dyed hair) and keeps her head down. Scared to move or do something wrong and get in trouble. She�s threatened to kill herself before, even had a note ready. I didn�t know her then, but I saw the text she sent her (ex?)boyfriend at the time. She constantly calls herself ugly and fat, though she�s adorable and thicc. I didn�t have the guts to say anything to her then. We were complete opposites yet we still dated that year. One of the worst/weirdest years of my life, since I was also having bad health problems.  My mind kept telling me to break up with her in the sixth grade and I listened. Two of the worst mistakes I�ve made. Now this year, we got back together. My mindset is different then before. I�m happier and more confident, even if I am submissive. I don�t have the thoughts of breaking up with her either. We can talk outside of school, we don�t have to worry about parents since they don�t care about our sexuality, and we hang out and she stays the night. She is also happier this year too. She smiles more, laughs more, I don�t think she cuts anymore though I�m not sure, she�s more confident in who she is. And you�d expect her to be submissive but she�s actually more dominant than me. I feel like that year was just bad timing for us to date, I had to get my thoughts straight (gay) before we dated again. And in the middle of this school year, we went for it. The beginning of our relationship we actually had a third person. They were Ghosts ex and it was not a good idea to date her. That is the one person I will never date again. Now it�s just me and her, and it�s amazing. She�s constantly on my mind, we�re always texting, and I always want to hang out with her. She�s the most adorable thing ever, even if she still thinks she�s fat and ugly. I know she�s not. Her laughs and smiles make my day better, so I always look forward to breakfast, lunch, and let out. We don�t have any classes together though, which sucks. But it�s okay because I�m always thinking about her anyway. She�s probably the best thing that�s ever happened to me this year, and I�m so happy that we ended up dating again, this time it�s much healthier. I don�t know know why I�m sharing this here, but I felt the need to talk about her with someone that isn�t just my friends. So I�m gonna share our story with Reddit. Enjoy!

This is a very random story but bear with me XD. So one time when I was around 5 or 6 years old, I woke up at like midnight to go to the toilet. I really had to pee. So I got out of my room and my mom heard me waking up. She was still in the living room with my dad watching tv and eating some snacks. She asked me if I could bring her a fork. So I ran to the kitchen and grabbed a fork, but I really really had to pee at this point. So I didn't bring her the fork and decided to go pee first. We always had a rule in our house that we had to use slippers when going to the toilet. We had special slippers for just the toilet, they usually were next to the door of the toilet. I started looking for them, but I couldn't find them. And me being the good kid that didn't like to break rules, I had to wear something. The next best thing was a pair of my mom's boots. These were leather boots with heels. I sat down to put them on, but after I got the first boot on, I was about to pee my pants. So I was like well one boot is better than no boot. I finally went and peed. After I got out of the toilet, I saw that my dad had a new keychain attached to his keys. He always left the keys in the frontdoor at night. I was curious and went to see what it was. My parents then heard the keys and came to me very surprised why someone was trying to open the frontdoor at midnight. I was just standing there with still 1 boot on, a fork in one hand and the keys in the other hand. My parents interpreted it as me trying to walk away sleepwalking, cause what would be another normal explanaition for all this? Every now and then they bring up the story and we have a good laugh about it.Very random, but I had to share XD

**Be warned, there are graphic descriptions about my injury in this story**When I was in 7th grade, I was a straight A student (besides PE as you find out), and well behaved. Unluckily, I got PE first period. First period PE is worse than it just being in the morning. The teacher was lazy, and would make us set up everything, even though some of us (me and half of the girls) weren�t strong enough to lift the heavy equipment and move it. The track was always wet and muddy, and he only gave us around 2 minutes to change out of our clothes. He was also really perverted and would look into the girl�s locker room while we changed. He had gotten arrested twice in the 10 years he had been teaching for sexual abuse (grabbed a girl�s ass, walking into the locker room and obviously staring at the girls while they were changing) and was somehow still teaching. Another thing I should mention is that in early fall, my foot got really messed up. I had an ingrown toenail, and that became infected, and the skin began to grow over my nail, and my nail continued to go deeper into my skin. By the end of the first semester, my entire big toe was purple and half of my nail was covered in oozing infected purple skin, actually, all the purple skin was oozing nonstop, to the point where I had to bandage my toe in a way that it covered my entire big toe, which resulted in most of my foot being covered in a bandage. I bandaged my foot so that I was able to wear shoes. If I didn�t bandage it, it would ooze so much that my mom had to help me cut through a block of dried blood and pus so that I could take my sock/shoe off. Everybody knew about my foot. Every kid in my PE class and every office staff, as well as all of my teachers knew. At the end of the first quarter, my toe wasn�t that messed up yet, so we went to a doctor for the first time about my foot. He said that if I pushed the overgrown skin to the side, and didn�t run or put excessive weight on it, I would be fine. He gave me a doctor�s note that said that I was not allowed to run or put excessive weight on it, and that the note was in effect until a doctor said that I was clear. I show the note to all my teachers as well as some office staff, and they all understand. For the first two weeks, everything was going well. But I get to school on Monday morning, and my PE teacher decided that I was fine and could run again. I showed him the note again and he said that I was fine. For the rest of the semester, my foot kept getting worse and worse. My mile time was slowly decreasing, and one of my PE teacher�s rules is that if you don�t beat your previous mile time, you have to run it again until you do. Eventually, after I finished a 22-minute mile (I was trying really hard too because he had threatened with detentions already) he had had enough. He gave me 2 detentions, and told me to stop milking the �little cut on your foot�. I was a good student, and was confused on what to do for a detention, so I just went to the room he told me to at lunch. When I got to school the next day, I asked them if they knew why my PE teacher was ignoring my note and making me run. They said that they didn�t actually know that he was doing anything, and that he had been saying that I was milking my injury to get out of everything, even the warm ups. When I told them what happened, they apologized profusely, and excused my second detention. They can�t get rid of the first detention�s mark though, because instead of marking it as a detention, he gave me a PERMANENT MARK on my record. This really scared me because I was shooting for an Ivy League school, and didn�t want this to hurt my chances. Also, not a months later, I was crutch walking out of the hospital with crutches and a boot because it had become difficult to walk. The doctors said that I could have avoided it if I hadn�t been running. I went to surgery (that would have been avoided had I not ran) in late summer to get my foot fixed.Anyone who thinks this is fake, I can PM you an image of the aftermath of my foot. My nail is bumpy from not being able to grow out, and I have a flat edge of nail that isn�t attached to the nail bed. I can�t and won�t send you a picture of the toe while it�s infected because it was absolutely disgusting and I deleted all the pictures because they brought up bad memories.

I'm posting this here because r/nosleep doesn't let me because the stupid 500 words limit.This is a short and weird story I just wanted to share (also I don't remember the details, sorry)When I was a kid, every morning I heared a beautiful song in a flute. It wasn't happy or sad or lovely; it didn't have any feelings, but it was beautiful. It was... Complicated and short. (the flautist repeated it  3 or 5 times).To this day I still remember it perfectly. Every note. Without a fault. A lot of notes in the first few seconds, played very fast, and then slow and peaceful notes. Constantly.I don't know why but when this song played I've always imagined a black man with very short hair, carrying a little red carriage with wheels, sometimes with a flute or sometimes just nothing. His character was calm and quiet, but I was afraid of him (it scares me how specific is this. I've never seen something like that in my life).What is weird is that I live in a 5th floor and (the song came from the street. You know, like when you hear something and know from when it comes) I could hear the song so well that to do that you should play that thing on full volume. Here in my neighborhood we always had problem with this kind of stuff (like parties that blast music too loud during the night, etc.) But I've never heared of someone trying to report it (remember, I was in a 5th floor and the song played from the street) The weirdest part is that when I asked around, nobody heared something like that in their lifes. It was like I was the only one who could hear that. I remember a teacher knew what I was talking about, but I don't remember what she told me...I stopped listening to that song when I was 11, nearly 12 (I don't remember when, exactly.)Maybe I was just hallucinating? Probably, and that idea scares me more than a calm flutist, carrying a red carriage every morning and playing the same song.Also, sorry for bad english, and bla bla bla.So, that's all. What do you think?

One of the foremost experts in holistic yoga and transcendental body modification was in deep concentration. He was working on achieving the ultimate position of bliss. Others had tried (and almost managed) to adopt the incredibly difficult pose but ultimately their limited flexibility and concentration let them down. Only the undisputed master of body rearrangement had any real chance of contorting into the �Mount Everest� of impossible yoga positions. After 14 long months of intensely dedicated stretches and pretzel-like practice contortions, Haru Rajnese finally managed to do what no other human being had ever done. His svelte body bent into a previously-thought impossible pose of limbs and intertwined muscle. His left arm was wrapped around his right leg. His left leg was bend around his neck and torso. His lean torso was curved backward in an unnatural, very twisted way. His right arm snaked around his neck like a menacing serpent squeezing it�s hapless prey. His contorted head was between the bend of one knee. A casual observer would�ve thought he was the unfortunate victim of a horrible industrial accident. A large gathering of admirers and onlookers came to witness his crowning triumph. The revered yogi was silent in the incredibly complex position for many, many hours. He had systematically removed all air from his lungs in order to achieve the jaw-dropping feat. For this reason, he had to breath only once every three minutes. Speaking was utterly impossible and many of his supporters worried he might be unable to reverse the ridiculous tangled knot of human flesh and bone. Even his fingers were bent awkwardly to facilitate the noble effort.For hours he remained stationary. The crowd murmured and grew restless. They worried he was in deep distress or incapable of asking for help untangling himself. A few of them decided it had went on for too long. They sought to �rescue� him but were stopped by his assistants. To �help� the guru master would be to bring unforgivable shame upon him. It would undo his greatest triumph since the point was to adopt the inhuman position, and then to return back to normal posture, unscathed. They were exhorted to be patient a little longer. Master Haru knew what he was doing. He would rather die in that tangled mass of unrecognizable body parts that ask for help in undoing it. An audible gasp filled the crowd as a single finger began to twitch on the confusing heap of intertwined flesh before them. He was in the slow process of unwinding. Over the next three hours, the focused yogi slowly weaved himself into certain new positions, in order to return. It was the equivalent of being stuck in a ridiculously tight parking spot and having to do a multi-point turn to extract yourself. The way out was through. His mind and body were one. Bones cracked. Muscles twitched involuntarily. Joints were being asked to bend in impossible directions. It was biological madness.For the first time in many hours, the master blinked a single time. The empty haze in his eyes drifted away. His mind was slowly returning back to consciousness. His chest heaved. There were only a few things left to reposition, for his body to return back to �normal�. It was spellbinding to witness but the crowd remained respectfully silent during the final stages. They had been warned that even near the end, speaking to him could break his trance and harm him. With the last few bends, he was �back�. A slow wave in his muscles signified he was repairing the damage to his tissues for the abuse his body just endured. He took a dramatic deep breath and opened his eyes again. He stood before all the onlookers expressionless. To even smile at his success would be to permit pride. It would negate the entire process of self-discovery and mind over body. He even sought to excise the inner pride he felt. The gathered crowd remained respectfully silent as they had been instructed to be (by the master�s dutiful assistants).He took a solitary, respectful bow. Soon he would retire to his modest quarters. He desperately needed to rest but before the onlookers could disperse, one impulsive young man couldn�t contain his excitement over witnessing the amazing spectacle. He blurted out; �Master! Master! Did you learn anything from your deep exploration of the mind and body?�The rest of the attendees at the meditation gathering were shocked by his stark breach in etiquette. They were all very curious, but only the one man failed to contain his immediate need to know. Many of those present grimaced from shame or vicarious embarrassment but the questioner remained steadfast in his desire to be answered right then. The master made eye contact with the brazen youngster. �I would�ve shared with everyone the details of my journey (when we were together again at the temple), but since you ask now, I shall now answer. In this journey to better know the human mind and body, I just discovered there is actually a second anus on some people. Like the traditional one, it breaks wind without thought and spews forth unnecessary waste. The most surprising thing about this curious discovery is that it resides in the middle of the face. Now, I must retire. I am greatly fatigued by my meditative endeavors. Good evening all.�

Aight so if I remember correctly, this happened in July before my sophomore year of highschool so I was 15. I was friends with this girl at the time who was the same age as me and she had a sister who was ~5 years older, so she was around 20 or 21. So, my friend invited me out for a movie (it was the first purge) and she says that her sister will be there w her friend and our mutual friend will also be there. I say okay and my sister drops me off at the movie theater. I get there and say hi to my friends and we get our tickets. Right off the bat I can tell something is off w my friend�s sister and her friend. They are laughing at nothing and kind of swaying around when they walk and it is seriously annoying my friend who promptly tells me that her sister and friend were just smoking and they are high. This didn�t surprise me bc my friend�s sister usually smoked so I was like whatever, plus I really don�t care what other people choose to do with their bodies. My friend was annoyed bc her sister at that time was doing a lot of drugs other than just smoking and she seemed to be unable to be sober. Even our mutual friend who is a huge stoner and sells thought my friend�s sister had a bit of an issue. Anyways, we get into the movie and I kind of forget abt all that, then when the movie ends it�s like midnight. My sister was busy with her boyfriend and I was not about to ask my mom to come get me since the movie theater I was at was about 20 minutes away from my house. Also my mom was under the impression I was getting a ride home from my friend�s sister. So, like the dumbass I am, I decide to get a ride home from my friend�s sister. We leave the theater and get into the car, mind you my friend�s sister and her friend can barely walk in a straight line. Me, my friend, and our mutual friend get in the backseat and my friend�s sister is in the drivers seat, her friend in the passenger. It takes my friend�s sister like 10 minutes to even turn the car on and when she does she starts blasting music and pulls out 2/3 of a blunt. She starts smoking it w her friend and my friends and I are just in the back, annoyed bc all we wanna do is go home. So we�re in this vacant ass movie theater parking lot and my friend�s sister and her friend are just fucking blazing. Eventually, my friend�s sister starts driving but she�s driving like a fucking crazy person (way below speed limit, stopping at green lights, and going the longest way possible to get places). She ends up getting on the highway and going to a toll booth bc she went the wrong way. I was so scared we were gonna get the cops called on us at this point bc we�re at this toll booth, my friend�s sister is so high that she can�t talk and her friend has to talk for her and the toll booth guy is just like r y�all gonna pay orr. My friend�s sister is trying to explain that we didn�t mean to be at a toll booth but she can�t verbalize it properly and the guy just gets annoyed and tells us to turn around (I wasn�t completely sure what was going on as I was in the backseat and scared out of my mind). So we end up back near the movie theater and she is still driving like a dumbass, but then she does something really fucking stupid. For some reason she pulls back into the movie theater parking lot and then goes through it to the other exit. She sits at a green light again until her friend tells her to go. She inches up until we�re in the middle of the fucking street and she just sits there. Mind you, this street is usually extremely busy but thank fuck it was almost 1 am bc there was basically no one on the road. But we�re sitting there in the middle of the street, the perfect position to get t-boned, and a car starts coming up. Mind you we are all yelling at this bitch to fucking go and she�s just fucking gone. This car is getting closer and I�m sitting there ready to pray for my life and I don�t even believe in god. Finally her friend shakes her and she comes to and she slowly turns to get back onto the road. I finally got home though it took about 30 minutes longer than it should have and I stink of weed. Luckily I told my mom a rough estimate of when I would be home and she said she was okay with it and that she would most likely be asleep when I got home. So I get home and, thank god, my mom is asleep. I let my dogs out to pee, drenched myself in perfume and went to bed. Now this story wouldn�t be that bad if it weren�t for what happened a few months later. My friend�s sister was w her friend from that night except he was driving. They were both very high, I�m not sure on what, and they ended up getting in crash so bad it was on pretty much every local news station. The car was absolutely totaled and my friend�s sister�s friend was fine but my friend�s sister broke her hip and leg. She ended up being in the hospital for like a month and had to do months of physical therapy to regain full motion in her hip and leg. It haunts me to this day that an accident like that could�ve happened the night I was in the car w her and to this day I cannot believe I was stupid enough to let someone that fucking high drive me home. Also this girl and I are no longer friends (not bc of this).

   I�ve never been good at writing, just having some thoughtsIt�s the same as any other night, sneaking off for a few cigarettes, looking off at the leafless nighttime trees, either out of a slightly open window or standing outside with a old leather jacket, and combat boots in boxer briefs, daydreaming about fantasies that would never and could never happen. Funny how sometimes we day dream in the middle of the night. Middle-of-the-night dream, doesn�t sound as romantic. The wretched stench of burnt ash on my finger tips, and the inevitable sore throat that soon follows. It�s such an oddly comforting sensation, those little moments in time that you get to think, reflect, plan and of course the wonderous panic. And what does one think about at these little moments? We look at the lifeless cold trees and think about the time that when we were young, we used to pick dandelions for mom, or any other undistinguished flower, present them to her as an offering and a promise that everything is alright, and of course, the thought of self mutilation. How strange those two ideas go hand in hand for me, how curious. It�s such an oddly comforting sensation... those little moments. The sharp touch of cold steel resting and waiting on warm flesh, the swift moment of hesitation, the long drag of whatever I decided to use in that moment, and the small pulsing of the open wound. Almost like a heartbeat telling me everything is going to be ok.   What strange creatures we are as humans. We are given this gift of life and flesh, yet, some of us take this gift for granted. This precious, painstakingly detailed and wonderful gift and destroy it. This the curiosity that kills us. Much like a child begging to see its Christmas presents early, crying to mommy and daddy. It�d be sad if it weren�t so pathetic.   You think that all this would develop into more of a psychological pain, not necessarily just a physical one. But it did. It hurt, every day. I�d wake up, hurting, wishing that I hadn�t woken up that day. I�d rather be unconscious, I�d rather throw or break things. But all I would break is myself. I miss my brother. I miss my mom my dad and my sister. I miss the love of my life. I�m a failure at most things, did you know that? I see myself as the reckless bastard child that I refused to take responsibility for. I�m so tired of fighting, so tired for running. All the stern and lies. I�m reaching the end of my rope here.Funny, these little moments in time we have. They are so precious. The moments we have to ourselves to think and reflect. We as humans don�t do it enough I think, which can be dangerous. But to think all the time? Even more so.My cigarette is almost out and I can�t help but worry where I will go to. Hopefully somewhere warm. I�ll take one last breath.I�ve become quite tired lately. Maybe it�s time to rest.

Today I am standing in my usual place between the men�s coats and the children�s T-shirts. they opened the shop 1 hour and twenty-seven minutes ago but unfortunately time does not equal customers, which can lead to a somewhat boring day for me. The customers are allowed to enter and depart the facility whenever they please but if I had it my way I would lock every single one of them in with me. Not specifically to harm but more so to observe. Customers always stroll by me far too quickly for me to observe. &#x200B;This is troubling, but what am I to do? Nothing. For I am only a mannequin�&#x200B;New questions, lost answers. This is all that I am ever handed. I simply cannot comprehend what it is that these �Customers� do. Do they hunt? I do not know. Do they eat? I do not know. Do they bleed? I do not know. Do they DIE?&#x200B;I do not know. For I am only a mannequin�&#x200B;Customers are a strange thing. I have not seen it but I have heard that they trade in this facility. Trading? Is this what they do? Seems quite silly, but who am I to judge for I am only a mannequin. Apparently they choose items that they desire at the time then take these previously mentioned items to the beings who are not customers. These beings resemble customer�s but unlike regular customers they seem to be tied to this facility. They do leave but they always come back and the way to tell them apart from customers is by their tags. These tags all say something different. My favorite non-customer is tagged �Jonathon� and he has smooth brown skin and a nice teethy smile. He is always walking up and down the aisles next to me fixing shirts and coats previously unfolded by customers. Jonathon does look at me from time to time but it is nothing more then a quick glance. I do not blame him though. I cannot move nor respond, which would lead to very boring conversations�&#x200B;But what am I to do? For I am only a mannequin�&#x200B;I do not know if Jonathon likes me or not, but it does not matter much to me. All that matters is that Jonathon keeps coming back so that I may observe. Observe. Is this my purpose? Seems quite boring, but maybe a purpose can be boring. Jonathon and the other tagged customers purpose appears to be rather tedious and dull. Fixing customers messes and tending to their every need. Pathetic. But I can not help but feel pity towards them. Some of them that is.&#x200B;I do not pity the one tagged �Zach�. Zach has taking me apart and placed me into darkness many times. I do not like it when Zach takes me apart. it doesn�t hurt. I just don�t like it. I do not like seeing that I am held together by screws. But every time I�m dismantled I can�t help but wonder if Zach is also held together by screws. It would bring me great pleasure to dismantle Zach. I wouldn�t even bother putting him back together. But I don�t think that customers and tagged customers CAN be put back together. One time not to long ago I happened to see a customer missing an arm. I would�ve offered mine but, of course, I cannot�&#x200B;For I am just a mannequin�&#x200B;I see various types of customers. Big ones, small ones sometimes really tall ones. But, according to my observations, this does not matter to the customers as much as one specific thing. What is this thing? It appears to be color. So far the colors I have seen of customer have been various shades of brown and cream. It does not happen often but on occasion a couple of customers of different color who seem to be unfamiliar with each other will critique eat others character based on said color. This is strange. They are all customers yet they still attack each other. Why? Do the colors evoke some sort of strong hatred whenever they are seen by a customer of a different color? This cannot be the answer because most of the time the customers get along no matter what color. &#x200B;It���..makes me feel warm. not warm like the air conditioning in the facility, but warm like��..like a bad kind of warm. Every time I think about how foolish the customers are it burns me on the inside. If the customers make all of these clothes that surround me in different colors then why is it so hard for them to accept customers when THEY are different colors? It burns me inside, but I like this feeling of warmth. It�s somehow�..comforting to know that these beings can make all of this stuff that surrounds me yet still not be able to come together as one. It�s pleasing to my very few senses to know that while they all throw away their pleasures and privileges, I can stand in my usual place between the men�s coats and the children�s T-shirts and observe as their world collapses around them. It gives me joy, and why shouldn�t it? It�s the only thing I can do. I can only observe�&#x200B;For I am only a mannequin�

Long ago, I had a friend that I met online back when I had the Wii U. We used to always play Minecraft together with this other person and the three of us would collaborate on inventions and creative structures that made one of my Minecraft worlds the best It could ever be. We even used to call each other and talk about how we would meet up when we were older and talk about the desires we always wanted. Until he became inactive and never came online ever again. Except the last unexpected day he decided to come on for the last time and tell me that we need to play Minecraft more often. After our last play discussing how we lost so many friends and inspiration, he had left  and never came back again. I guess it really doesn�t matter since there are a million other people who have experienced this. It�s crazy to see how online people can motivate us to do such amazing things in games especially in the creative world of Minecraft.

Backstory:So this kid doesn't have a good reputation in our pool. I would have posted this to r/entitledparents or kids ( whatever ) but i think i would be a person who gets triggered really easily but maybe not. Anyways lets get on with it.Story:So me and my brother go to that pool everyday. We do many laps horizontally (across the pool) and vertically ( across the pool ). But its a public pool and i have seen many entitled people. But none of them were talking to me so minded my own buissness. We live in dubai and people here arent that rude or insensible. But oh BOI, is there some *DUMB* kids. This kid like other werent very smart. The pool usually consists of 4,6,7,9,11,13 y/o's. So this kid was 7 and he was REALLY ANNOYING but me and my brother were cheeky morons so we annoyed him back (the proper good way c:) . So he had a small football and we were 'playing' with him for a little we genuinely had some laughs and giggles until this happened. We were playing until the kid started SCREAMING "DADDY PASS THE BALL DAAAADDDY" (btw he was screaming this to my brother and everyone looked at him.)  He was 7 and didn't really know to much. But i can sort of say. That was pretty funny.Im sorry that the main part was so short and the backstory was so long.This was my first time writing a story.I hope you like it.Cheers :D

The Dirty 8:Back when I was in school for massage therapy 8 years ago I was taking night classes. After class one night a couple of my friends/classmates were talking about Fast food and started talking about Jack in the Box. I was thinking to myself, "I like Jack in the Box, I haven't had curly fries in months. Let's get some on the way back home!"I lived out in the Outer Richmond district of San Francisco, and the bus route to get to where I lived is the 38 Geary, AKA "The Dirty 8". It's called the Dirty 8 because it's one of the few lines that goes 24 hours a day and it's a very long bus ride start to finish, so homeless people tend to ride it a lot. So if you've ridden MUNI or BART you know that crazies tend to come out on public transit. One of the stops between school, and my rental was right across the street from Jack in the Box. The 38 comes every 15 minutes so I had plenty of time to get my food and get on the next bus.I was riding the bus, I got off, I ordered my food, and got back across the street to get on the next bus. As I was riding the bus I saw that there were a few college girls around my age, I had just turned 20 years old and was single, so I sat down next to them to talk to them see if I can get a number or get a girl back to my place for a massage and ultimately fuck her.The conversation with the girls is going fine, we're talking about classes, and whatever bullshit the kids talked about in 2011. Probably Skrillex and LMFAO, I don't remember to be honest. It was one of the longer busses that are like 2 bus lengths, and kinda look like accordions with what connects them. We were sitting up front and the time was around 11pm. I noticed a guy get up from the back and walk to the back exit out of the corner of my eye. But he doesn't get off. when we stop. I didn't think anything of the guy because there have been several times when I got up a couple stops before mine. But then he started to get closer and closer and there are like  5 exits. The 2nd time he stands next to another exit I was thinking...maybe he has bad eyesight, it's dark, let's give him the benefit of the doubt. I left my glasses at home, so maybe this is nothing. When the guy finally made his way to the exit just before the one at the front, I knew something was going to happen.I tried to ignore the guy, but he was staring at the girls harder and creepier than a Priest does an altar boy. A few minutes goes by, and I'm watching him while talking to the girls just in case he does something. Then he walked right across from me and stopped between the exits, but closer to the front. I was focusing my attention on the conversation with the girls, not trying to draw too much attention to the guy. Then I saw the bottom of his  windbreaker moving a lot near the bottom out of the corner of my eye. I knew what he was doing, it was so obvious, I didn't want to look, but I had to. I slowly looked up thinking to myself, "Please don't be doing what I think you're doing. I know you're jerking off, but please fucking please don't be jerking off right now!"There it was...his little black cock and balls out of his jeans. COCK AND BALLS WERE OUT! COCK AND BALLS WERE OUT! and he was jerking away at it. I was the only one to notice, and I couldn't let him keep going...he was literally 2 feet away from me. I had to say something. "Are you fucking serious right now dude?! Are you seriously fucking jerking off on the bus staring at these girls!? Get the fuck out of here you fucking creep! What the fuck is wrong with you!" I yelled at him as I started to push him towards the exit. Now everyone was looking, the girls, the other people on the bus, the bus driver turns around to see what's going on before he stops.As I was pushing the guy out of the bus he's giving me this dirty look, this look of disgust like I was the one jerking off in public, like I did something wrong. Once he's off everyone was talking about what just happened, the girls obviously now freaked the fuck out and just wanting to go home.So the guy totally fucked me over with a double cock block. Not only was he jerking off in public right fucking next to me while I was trying to pick up some girls. He was also black with a little dick that couldn't have been more than 3 1/2 inches and thin. I'm only half black, so these college girls are now completely disillusioned by the myth that all black guys are hung...so they probably thought I had a little dick too.So I went home...alone. I went into my room, turned on netflix and ate my curly fries.And that is my story, of The Dirty 8.

Okay, I have a story.When I was in the 7th grade, I knew this kid (let's call him Ben). Ben was nice enough, and was friends with almost everyone in our grade. The one weird thing about Ben was his haircut. He sported the same bowl cut he'd had since the first grade! You would look at the pictures in his house and in the yearbooks and he had the same haircut. Eventually, we all stopped wondering what his forehead looked like and just accepted that he was never getting rid of that horrible haircut.Things were normal up until the beginning of the second semester. My friends and I were all sitting on the bus, goofing off like middle schoolers do, when all of the sudden this kid with a buzz cut walks onto the bus. We don't recognize this kid, and he just walks onto the bus and sits down in Bowl Cut Ben's seat next to Ben's friend (Let's call him Jake). We all sit there awkwardly for a minute, not sure how to talk to the new guy. Well, he caught me looking at him and said, "What are you looking at, Sarah?" I was quite taken aback. How did he know my name? It was at that moment when we all realized: IT WAS BOWL CUT BEN!!!He thought it was really funny that none of us recognized him, and we all decided to trick some people into thinking that he was someone else. Ben was in my math class, so we decided to trick the class into thinking that he was a new kid from Germany (Ben was in drama, and had a SPOT ON German accent).Fast forward two or so hours, the two of us walked into Math class and, just as we had expected, nobody recognized Ben. I brought Ben up to the teacher, and introduced him to the teacher as Gunther, a foreign exchange student from Germany. We hadn't expected him to, but he actually bought it! Our teacher even went so far as to bring "Gunther" up to the front of the class and introduce him to the class. When "Gunther" went up and stood there, doing his best to appear awkward and scared, I gave in and burst out laughing, which caused him to burst out laughing, too. We told the teacher about the trick, and we all had a good laugh.Sorry for the long story, hope you liked it!

 I laid in my bed at night, thinking: what if I created a story, making myself believe, I Actually dreamt it. I was traveling around in the streets in a foreign country, suddenly taking a notice at a patch of black color on the ground. Getting closer to it, It�s a stain, something not from earth, has shapes and figures that I've never seen before, something alienated.As I�m about to take a picture of it with my phone, a guy arrives, watching me, watch the black figure. You�re the only other person who noticed this, the whole week, he says.we immediately sparked a conversation, realizing we have a lot in common in terms of interests, personality and talents. as we chat, he invited me to dinner at a restaurant with his friend he met recently too. Moving on, all three of us bond that night; telling stories and discussing our feelings and thoughts on different topics, laughing and falling in love with the experience. then we realize. The dream is about to end, this place we met; Is a temporary existence. Wanting to capture this fictional moment forever, we decide to save a portrait of our new companions. each of us taking a picture of the other two on his phone. and then it ends, just like that., as if it never happened. I go over the normal rituals of every morning. and decide to head over outside. as I�m about to lock the door, I can�t but get a feeling I forgot something, I go over everything, the windows are all closed, the oven is turned off, and lastly; I pet my dog before taking my leave again. as I walk down the hallway, this feeling intensifies into something dissonant. Whatever I say to myself. just another weirdly depressing morning. putting on the AirPods from my pocket with my favorite playlist.Well then I kinda forget about it for the next many hours. I meet different people and have better than average small talk with them. It�s now six pm, the sun is now setting and there's a beautiful color filling the sky, something purplish. Anyway, as I�m about to pay for my iced matcha tea, Three small portraits of myself fall out of my wallet. I pick them up and ponder for a while. I don�t know why, but It immediately reminded me of that feeling I had in the morning. Should I take it..? the waitress asks hesitantly. she refers to the bill I have yet to pay. Yeah, moving back to reality, I hand her my credit card. Are you okay..? looks like you�ve been woken up from a dream or something. Oh no it�s nothing, really, I say. she leaves.then. out of nowhere.. It hits me. I remember everything, in reverse, taking the pictures, laughing, all the different topics, the street� A feeling of endless loss and and loneliness, I realize.. I won�t see those two guys ever again, and worst yet. They never existed to begin with. I feel alone.. still looking at those photos, seeing only.. a conspicuous black hole..

I was around 12/13 years old and i was downstairs playing with my practice butterfly knife that i got as a gift from my dad. My mum was out and my sister was in her room.  I was in my living room while watching Simspons practicing new knife tricks (believe at the time it was a xen rollover) then as i'm watching i drop my knife and then there is a knock at my door, my blinds were closed so no one could've seen me. My mum told me not to open the door whilst I was home alone (either myself or sister) so i didn't, now a days i ask who is it incase it's any postage or anything. So anyways I don't open the door, since i got told not to by my mum. Then i wait for a couple of minutes, then open my living room door and ran up stairs as i usually check who it is. Then i walk into my mums bedroom and look out the window. Out there i see to people in black ski masks, a fluffy coat and stuff, didn't see them carrying anything. I wonder who that was but since I didn't know too much about robbery, mainly watch stuff like Top 10 Bank Robberies or Top 10 robbers that haven't been found, didn't see them wearing black masks as much so i didn't know. Then like last year or maybe this year (15 btw) it comes into my head and thought, if i'd have opened that door, i could've been robbed, kidnapped or killed. I live in UK near London so mostly there are things like mopeds stolen, or stuff from people in public places, for example a macbook.  I don't think i told my parents or my sister i just brushed it off and didn't think of it

My sister and my pillow:Author: ParadoxiamGenre: Horror, 1-paragraph, tragedy.I used to have a pillow between my legs when I sleep. My sister gets jealous that I get to have two pillows and she only gets one. At the middle of one night, I woke up, seeing that my sister had two pillows, she was as pale as every other night, and she had been staring at me when I was asleep. She had taken it, and she told me.. "Thank you for sharing it, bro." When I woke up, I told my mother about it and she said, with teary eyes.. "Y-your sister's been dead for years now.". And I said.. "But she's been sleeping with me every night."

Talking to a few friends the other day about random events from middle school made me think of this story. I'm still very new to reddit, and I LOVE to write, so I thought here would be appropriate. If anyone has a suggestion if this post should be under a different subreddit, please let me know! If you're in for a sad story, buckle up.Here's a little bit of backstory for what I was like in middle school:I fucking sucked. I tried too hard to fit in because I always had the underlying thought of "everyone hates me". Granted, I was "popular" (based on middle school standards)  from 6th grade to about the middle of 7th. I gossiped, I shit-talked, I did everything under the sun to make people hate me. Now, there have been some situations where I guess you would consider bullying, but I was 12, and this is when cyber bullying REALLY started to come about (I'm a 19 y/o F now for reference). I had a friend in particular that would pick fights with me all the time over stupid shit and I called her fat and crossed the line. Stupid shit like that. With that fight came my downfall, as that was the first time I ever picked on someone, but it wasn't for no good reason. I ended up having almost no friends. All the friends I mostly had, I made online who went to a different school around my area, and frequently hung out with them. And then I started getting bullied, and it happened for about a year and a half. People would harass me and call me names anonymously on a site called [ask.fm](https://ask.fm) if anyone remembers. I still have all that account information and looked at all the horrible things people used to say to me. I really became an outcast for a while. That's when my social anxiety started to rev up. I was also an attention seeker. I used to self-harm a bit. Nothing too insane to cause permanent scarring, but 50% of me felt like that was my only way out because of how bad the bullying got, the other 50% was for attention. I hate to admit it, but my 12/13 year old self thought this was acceptable. My mother on the other hand thought it was all for attention, which is untrue.I can't remember a ton about middle school bc I try to push it as far back into my memory as possible, but there's one incident of bullying i'll never forget.This happened in 8th grade, and I got a call from someone who we'll call B. I had been friends with B since elementary school, but we hadn't been friends for a while. I really can't remember if something specifically happened between us, but I know we weren't on the best of terms. At this local park, they would do Movie Nights on Friday or Saturday nights where they had a HUGE screen to showcase to kids and parents and everyone would bring chairs and food and have a great time. A lot of middle schoolers would go with their friends to just hang out. B asked me to go with all these people who either didn't like me, or who I didn't talk to. I kept saying stuff like, "Why do you want me to go? I don't talk to them." She kept counteracting with "Come on! It'll be fun!" So me being dumb, I went. I took a friend with me, though, (I'll refer to her as C) in case anything happened. My mom knew about the entire thing, so when we got there, she waited in the car for a bit off to the side just in case if I needed to leave.C and I see B with the group of people. A boy there who we'll call F, I had a crush on him. And he knew. They all knew.  They're all clustered together, just laughing and staring at me. Who knows if they were laughing at me or not, but me and C thought they were. Then, I get a call from F saying, "Come over and hang out with us!!!" just laughing, all of them were. I felt sick to my stomach and ignored them and just tried to have a good time with C. We ended up walking around, and I see B's brother, and he walked past us and said something like "B wants to hang out with you! B wants to talk to you!" laughing with his friends. He said it like he knew we weren't on good terms.I finally had enough and somehow built up enough courage to say something. I started screaming at B and told her off for asking me to come here just to laugh at me. I don't remember what she was saying to argue back, but at that point I started going back to my mom's car. Someone asked me, "Did you just yell at B?" I replied with "Yeah, so fucking what." This area of time is blurry, and I don't remember how this escalated, but my mom ended up getting out of her car and coming over to me yelling at some other girl who was on B's side. I don't remember what my mom said either, but the girl I was yelling at said, "Does your mom know you do this?" and made a cutting motion on her arm. Her and her friends were laughing, I was 2 seconds away from punching this bitch in the face (I've never been in a fight then and still haven't). C, my mom, and I are all walking back to her car and I'm full on sobbing. On the way home I kept telling her I wanted to switch schools, but she seemed to have the impression that I brought this all on myself, and she refused since it was my last year of middle school.This was by fare the worst interaction I've had with bullying. Thankfully, I was never in any physical fights, but all of this was just emotional abuse. Some of the things I got said to me on [ask.fm](https://ask.fm) were: hump back whale, fat, "you shine just like a diamond, shine bright fatass", slut, along with every other synonym. Someone even went to far as to say that since I dye my hair so much, people are going to find me repulsive and I'll never get married.Middle schoolers are fucking brutal. Kinda just wanted a place to type this out.

This happened when i was on grade 3 so 6 years ago. Our class went to a different room because both teachers were doing a presentation about something. We got in there and sat down (on the floor). I was in the front. and like 5 minutes later I gotta take a wicked piss. So I put my hand up wanting to go to the bathroom. Now even though I have my hand up as high as I could and especially in front of both teachers, they didn't see me. So I start to try and wave my hand a Bit, But not too much because I didn't want to be rude. They still didn't see.So I begin to try make it go away so I don't have a pain in my bladder just cuz I gotta urinate. So I wiggle like I'm wiping my ass on the teacher's floor. I being to panic and start to sweat a bit (I'm still wiggling). So try raising my hand up higher and more towards the teachers. Still didn't see. Then I really gotta piss. Not only now was I wiggling and sweating, I began to turn red and start crying because it hurts and I gotta release my golden bodily fluid. (This all took place on Halloween)And I was wearing a fake moustache and beard so I started getting a bit of a rash on my face because I'm sweating and crying. Then 15 minutes later, the kid I'm sitting puts his hand up and points to me saying "he is crying" or something like that. Then they ask me what's wrong and I say in a sad voice, "I really need to go to the bathroom." So they let me go and I was so relieved that my bladder didn't explode and that I didn't piss or shit on anyone in the room.

Hello. Not long ago I used to run a semi-popular (depending on your point of view) horror channel on Youtube. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, a certain chain of events started happening which lead me to completely closing the channel and leaving any trace of my internet persona behind for good, out of fear that something bad might happen to me.You probably haven't heard of me, I wasn't involved with the english speaking part of Youtube. Regardless, I chose to remain anonymous for this story as i don't anything more happening to me.I was known for covering ARGs (alternate reality games, for the unaware) and creepy horror stories, sometimes i made a few debunking videos, other times i made community polls. I started getting a lot of attention when I made a video about a twitter account which had a man leaving cryptic messages about how he was holding several women captive around his house. After a week of posting that video I had about twice as many subscribers as I did before.Lots of people would leave me messages about how they wanted me to cover a topic, like a cryptic youtube channel or random videos that were supposedly from the deep web. I only did videos on the ones that I would find interesting, as there were many people trying to get popular without putting in any effort and just copying whatever was the latest fad at the time."dnahymybeid" at first didn't look very different from your typical low effort "creepy" twitter account. It was about a guy who would go to random women's houses and kill them, then he would post incredibly fake photos of their corpses. Needless to say, it never caught on and I ignored it.However... The guy trying to promote it was a completely different story. This dude just kept sending me links to his twitter account. Every time I blocked him from posting or messaging me he would make a new account and try again. He would not stop at the twitter thing either, he also made an equally lame youtube account trying to get me to cover his story.It was getting to a point where I didn't know what to do. If I made a video calling him out, I knew I would've been giving him the attention he wanted. Ignoring him didn't work either, since he would keep making new accounts to message me. Things would not get better from here...Eventually he started messaging me to my facebook account. How on earth did he find my real name, I have no idea, as I never ever associated it with my youtube account or any of my other social media. Needless to say, I was very creeped out by this. I talked to the police to see if anything could be done about this, but unfortunally they told me they couldn't do anything as the guy wasn't messaging me from his real facebook account, so they couldn't be able to identify him.I tried as hard as I could to go on with my life and ignore this incident, but I was just not able to do it. This whole thing was stressing me out, to the point where I didn't feel like posting anything for youtube for a week and had trouble sleeping several nights.I eventually checked his twitter and youtube account to find out more about the guy's background, and see if I could find out who he was or where he lived. I discovered that he lives a few miles away from my neighbourhood, because there's several pictures he's posted where I can see the streets he's been to, many of which I recognize. Still, none of this was enough to help me find any proof of his identity.After getting fed up with the situation, I made both a twitter post and a youtube video telling him, in very strong words and without mentioning who he was, that he'd better stop stalking me or i'd get the authorities involved. Eventually the guy made a mistake of posting in the youtube video's comment section instead of messaging me like he usually did, and so people flocked to his youtube and twitter accounts to harrass him for what he was doing.His accounts were soon gone without a trace. I don't know if he closed them or if youtube and twitter did it themselves. People were showing their support to me through comments both on my twitter and youtube pages, and I was very hopeful that, with his accounts now gone, this would've been the end of the story...This wasn't the case.The following night, before going to bed, I recieve a call to my cell phone from a random private number. I get cell phone calls frequently from my friends, so I just assumed this was one of them. I should've thought twice before doing that."Hello?""I know where you live, you are not-"I hang up, shaking and hyperventilating. I immediatly close all of my accounts including facebook. I go to the police the next day to see if they could find where the call was made from. I don't touch the internet for at least the following weeks. I take extra security meassures from that day on.In the end, I never knew if the guy was eventually caught or not.However, despite still being very afraid, I decided I wasn't gonna stay silent on this matter, which is why i'm sharing this story with all of you. I pray that none of this ever happens to any of you. Goodbye.

Yeah I was in the Boy Scouts for a few years and then left mainly cause of how traumatized I was from the following story�So each summer, our group of scouts goes on a week long camping trip at a reservation for camping and it�s meant to be a good time. I had been going for two years then and I liked it. But the other kids in our group were the one problem everyone had to handle. And I�m not being one of those �everyone�s an idiot except for me� kinda guys. Some of these kids were known to fuck around and start problems with the leaders and other scouts. But anyway, on my third year going there shit got real. (Literally). Everyone got in there tents, set up their sleeping bags and got doing there usual things. Me and a few others were playing a game of Siberian ratscrew ( it�s like Egyptian ratscrew except one person has a knife....and everyone else just uses their hands). While we are playing it we all begin to get tired, agree to call it, and head to our tents. Now remember, each tent has two people in it so it only makes this story weirder this way. One of the kids we were with goes into his tent and maybe three seconds later the entire campsite hears�WHO THE FUCK SHIT IN MY SLEEPING BAG?!?!?�Yeah. His tent partner literally took a dump in his bag and left him without one for the rest of the WEEK LONG trip. The kid denied it was him but we really weren�t falling for it. When I told my dad what happened he was as weirded out as I was and then just asked if wanted out. I was cool with it cause I just didn�t like Boy Scouts in general and I guess this was my chance to leave. ._.

Backstory: I am in a British school and a while ago she bought a few toy guns on warfare and she thought it would be fun to re-enact some exam question by using a few toy guns.  After we finished writing our questions she kept them in her closet.  As a joke, and all of her students knew this, she would pull out a gun from her closet and aim it at them (but not shoot) saying " I'll shoot one of you".  However, in this particular class, there was a new student who had just joined and she decided to do this a joke. She pointed the gun at the students (not him) and proceeded to shoot the gun at the back of the room and this new kid looked mortified.  After the lesson finishes, she calls the new student over and tells him "this was just meant to be a joke, I would never shoot one of you" And the kid replies saying " yeah, I found it funny, but I just came from America and the gun culture there was pretty scary". And just as he said that she placed her head into her hands out of sheer embarrassment.

Hi! I'm a 20 yo girl with an embarrassing story to share.This happened a couple of years ago  I was 18 and my brother was 11. He was bullied pretty badly by a boy in his class and was even scared to walk home from school. One day I decided to teach the little brat a lesson. I went to their school when they quit and started following my brother from a distance, hoping the bully would appear. Eventually he did and as he started pushing and beating my brother I ran up to them. The kid looked like a classic bully, big and almost obese. I started yelling at him, telling him to leave my brother alone and so on, but he just laughed and started to mock me. I was really angry at this point and grabbed his arm, but to my surprise he grabbed me back and pushed me up against a tree really hard. As I tried to break free the stupid brat grabbed my panties and gave me a wedgie! I screamed in shock (and pain) and cried out for my brother to help get him off me, but he was just standing there and didn't know what to do. The bully told me to mind my own business (and I honestly wished I had).Luckily at this point a car came by and the boy let me go. Me and my brother ran the rest of the way home and I told him we'd never speak of this again... I was so embarrassed getting owned by someone that young! The kid moved to another town shortly after this, such a relief :)

When I was a kid, my father did not come home one night. My mom told me that he had a nervous breakdown and that was the reason he was acting weird. I thought he was acting fine. "Whats wrong with him?" I asked, "He laughs for no reason", he has to stay at a special hospital for awhile.I really missed my dad, and a few weeks later we went to go visit him. We drove out to an unmarked building  that was a mix between a business complex and a hospital. He didn't look the same. He was only to meet with one person at a time. When I got to meet him I remember a great big hug, and his stubble scratching my face. "Why is your face scratchy?" I asked, he said because they won't allow him to use things like razors, shoelaces, and they also control how many cigarettes he is allowed. With his toothy smile and a laugh he waves his hands around to produce a half burnt cigarette with a magician's finesse. "I'm too smart for them" he said through a chuckle. We talked with the awkwardness of a forced conversation, he explained there was a room with bright lights he stayed in. "Why are you here dad?" I asked in a child's melancholy. "I'm here because I laugh at my thoughts." He was eventually released and put on medications. His spark died, he didn't laugh as much. He couldn't hold a job for long. He hobbies dwindled. He was a broken horse.He is old now, has survived cancer 3 times, suffering from dementia, in a nursing home. When I call or see him, and ask him about his cancer, or his health, he just laughs like he used to. "An't nothing killed me yet" he would bellow boisterously. I love that laugh.

***EDIT: Whoever bought gold for this post one year later - thank-you. Really. But I assure you the only part I played in making this awesome submission was simply remembering that it was a story worth reading. It is Brian Schul that deserves the magical internet gilding.***To hear the story as narrated by the pilot [click here](http://soundcloud.com/torrenegra/the-king-of-speed-sr-71).Written by Brian Schul�former sled (SR-71 Blackbird) driver.There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane�intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a read-out of his ground speed. Center replied: "November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground." Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "Houston Center voice." I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed in Beech. "I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed." Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren.Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. "Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check." Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a read-out? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: "Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground." And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done�in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it�the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: "Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request."Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground." I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: "Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money."For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A. came back with, "Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one." It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.

 In the middle of school some kid got a notification on their phone that said there was a fire at a house in new jearsy. We all knew the people in the fire because their kids went to our school. We were all fine at first bc we thought we were lucky that they were at school today. but then we all noticed that the kids that lived there weren't here bc they decided to skip school that day. Reality set in and people started to cry. Kids were sent home and a couple started to kick in their detective skills. This family was rich af so a group of people thought that this wasn't an accident, it was murder. So as kids do, we researched about what happened and we found out that after the fire, the father was found dead, BUT was found with a GUN SHOT WOUND in his head. This was where me and my friends were like HOLY SH\*T we were actually right. We did some MORE research and found out they had an uncle thats house was ALSO set on FIRE on the SAME DAY. We did some MORE REASERCH and found out he had charges of burglary of GUESS WHERE. THE FAMILY'S COMPANY. this man was killing his family to get the company, made it look like it wasn't an accident by lighting his own house own fire, going to his brothers house, bringing him outside, shooting him in the head, and then setting his brothers house on fire and killing everyone in it. we showed all of our evidence to the police and they arrested him and he is now spending jail time for life.

When I was in 4th or 5th grade,my cycle was stolen. Don't ask how, I don't know either lol. But anyway, my parents allowed me to use my sister's until they found mine, or bought me a new one (I got a new one xD). So my sister is elder to me, which basically means that her cycle was a little big for me.Now that particular cycle, had those curved handles. You know like those almost 90 degrees ones? I hope you get it lol. I don't know if there's a name for that but tell me if there is.Yeah so since the cycle was bigger it was a little tough for me to control it but I sorta managed it. So I went out cycling, everything was going well until this fucktard of a boy (probably my age. Didn't know him) overtakes me on his cycle and his back tire hit my front tire, which tells about his knowledge on how to overtake. Anyway, I lost control, lurched forward and fell into these bushes beside the road. It was like a downslope off the road so nobody could see me. I must have hit my head or something cause I was unconscious for a while. When I woke up, I saw that the cycle was on top of me. I tried to get it off but it wouldn't budge. Instead I felt a slight throb in the left side of my chest. I look down...and see that one of the handles has gone right inside my chest. I was in a really sour mood and just wanted to go home. I couldn't even call for help cause my voice was croaking for some reason. So I did what I had to do. I grabbed the handle, and slowly pulled it out, and walked home with a hole in my chest. Now here comes the wtf part. I NEVER went to the Doctor. I reached home, door was open (parents were out and sister is careless), ran into the bathroom before sis saw me, took a bath, shoved up some cotton and kinda plugged the hole. I did whatever I could to prevent anyone from seeing me bleed. Multiple bandages and whatnot. After a week my mom noticed it. I got a lecture obviously, but by then there wasn't any need to go to the doc cause the wound was somehow healing. The hole was closing up.It left a circle scar for a few years and then it started to fade. Now only a slight curve is left but I think that will fade too. It's been almost a decade since then. I think I'm still alive cause the handle missed my heart. I can say I survived a stab lol. But yeah...I'm dumb for not telling anyone. Believe it or not but this story is 100% true.

I have had my black cat, Ripley, since 2014. She was a wee tiny girl but her stomach was engorged due to giving birth before being rescued off the streets. After a few months though, her belly slimmed down and she became quite thin. She maintained a dainty 6.8 pounds for years, until I was getting ready to move; she dropped down to 5 pounds. The vet wasn�t worried considering she is a dainty, petite little cat (think: permakitten.) but then I moved. And then went through an awful divorce. Then lost my job; my poor cat suffered through my depressive episodes. I fed her when I remembered, just huge bowls of food to hopefully hold her over, and it was like she knew I had no money or means to get food quickly, so she�d eat sparingly. I fed her fish from my own meals. My dogs had a similar circumstance, except they were too food driven, lived comfortably up until that point�they had no regards to vacuuming up their food. But Ripley, she was a street cat. Those instincts crept in. She lost so much weight and it�d break my heart every time I�d pet her and feel her little bones. I tried, I did. But I was so depressed, and just over the world and the misery of my life. Then, I met my boyfriend. And then Ripley met him. And Ripley fell in love. She would cry and cry until he�d sit down. And they�d snuggle for hours if the time was there.After losing my house, I moved in with my boyfriend. And Ripley is thriving. She�s put on so much healthy, needed weight. Her fur is lush and soft. She will follow my boyfriend around everywhere. I�m glad that she doesn�t hate me. She came up to me as I ate a snack and rubbed on my leg, and purred gently and rubbed back again. I think she knows I tried my hardest. And I did. I almost gave her to my mom, but Ripley wasn�t going anywhere�she hid on the day I was supposed to leave and I couldn�t find her. I like to think she knew her destiny was yet unfulfilled and needed to stay. She had to meet my boyfriend. She had to see it through.I love my cat. I respect her boundaries. I love that she loves my boyfriend so much. And I love seeing her little pooch.

Some quick disclosures. This was back in 2007, before everyone had Facebook, I didn't have a Myspace and it was before everyone had cell phones (I had a basic Nokia brick at the time). My college was about 2 hours north of my hometown and I didn't really keep in constant contact with a lot of high school peeps.I had dated this guy in high school on and off again for a few years. I broke up with him a few weeks before going to college. It was because I found out that he (20 at the time) had not only cheated on me at a party but also with a 15 year old girl. He was arrested and had to register as a sex offender. Good. He actually was released after only a few weeks (thanks American Justice system) but I was already at my school. I had gotten a part time job at the college library and was working when I got a call from a random number with my hometown area code. I answered and I heard his voice. "Hey OP. It's Douche Canoe." "What do you want?" "Well, were you friends with Charlie Lastname?" "Yeah, so?" "Well, she died. She was hit by a truck while crossing the road. Her funeral is tomorrow, it's at *insert location* and I just thought you would like to go." " Yeah, thanks for the info." After we hung up, I excused myself and called my friend Jimmy who was a senior at my high school, where Charlie was as well. I explained to him what Douche Canoe told me. He said he hadn't her of her passing. He did mention that she hadn't been in school for several days but he assumed she was just out sick. He asked what I was going to do. I told him I guess we're going and I'll swing by and get him. Charlie and I weren't super close but I figured I should still go.The next day, I got excused from my classes and work and drove the two hours back and picked up Jimmy. I had printed out MapQuest directions (yes that's how old this story is). I asked Jimmy if he had heard anything. He said he let the school know and they excused classes for the rest of the day yesterday. We pull in and we know no one there.We walk in and see "You're loved, Charlene" all over the front entrance. "Huh... That's weird. Did they misprint her name?" Jimmy: "I mean, her family is super poor... Maybe this is a donated funeral and like..... They kinda get what they get?" "That seems shitty, but I guess sure." It amazes how they human mind can trick you into saying the stupidest thing when trying not to prove yourself wrong.We get in line to view the body. I'm looking around and I recognize no one. I spot my ex and his new girlfriend dressed like the fucking Crow. I ignore them, I'm not here for them I'm here for Charlie. We get closer to the casket and I'm looking at her. She does not look like my old classmate. Jimmy also notices and says "well, she was hit by a truck so maybe they did the best they could?" I see her mom. She's a petite blonde woman. I had been over to Charlie's house once or twice but i could have sworn her mom was a larger woman with dark features like Charlie.It's finally our turn. We get up to her and I'm looking at her. Suddenly Jimmy clasps my arm tight. I turn to look at him, he's pale and wide eyed. He whispers in my ear "OP, that's not Charlie. She's holding a rosary." "So?" "OP, she's a fucking Jew!" Then reality hits me. This is not Charlie, this really is some poor girl we do not know. The mother of the girl comes up. At this point I've thrown myself into Jimmy's chest, I'm so in shock I do start tearing up but out of embarrassment. She puts her hand on my shoulder. "I'm sorry, I don't think I've ever met you. Were you a classmate of Charlene?" "Yes. We used to hang out behind the school after drama club." "Charlene loved drama club." "Yes, yes she did, didn't she?" I say as this woman, this mother who just lost get daughter, pulls me into her embrace, a stranger who not only lied about knowing this dead girl but was crashing her funeral. This woman consoled me. After I pulled away and Jimmy and I walked off, I locked eyes with my ex. He knew what he did."What do we do now, OP? The funeral is starting." "We sit in the way back, it'll be too awkward to leave now." So we stay. Throughout the whole thing, in silence. My ex's girlfriend walks up to tell a story of life. This girl is absolute cringe. She and him have very dark, goth make up on, she is wearing platform shoes, the big chunky ones with small chains on them. She starts talking about how Charlene always encouraged her to pursue a singing career and started to sing "hey there, Delilah." Bitch busted out a fucking acoustic guitar stating this was Charlene's favorite song.Afterwards we were getting ready to leave and I gave my car keys to Jimmy and asked him to go turn on the car, I'm going to use the restroom. On my way back, my ex corners me in an empty room. "Wow, I can't believe you came. I'm so glad to see you." "Douche Canoe, I have nothing nice to say to you so I won't say anything. Move out of my way." He then started taking about how I've ignored his calls and he just wants me to know how sorry he is. I told him that I didn't care and that I couldn't fucking believed he lied about this. Who the fuck lies about someone dying?! He said he thought I knew Charlene. I said I know *Charlie Lastname* ya know, the person who he said it was. Jimmy came back in looking for me and we left. The next afternoon, I called Jimmy. Apparently, Charlie had spent most of the whole day in the office because of her "prank." She had been out with bronchitis for several days and came back to find out she had died. Jimmy relayed the following story. Charlie had been at home when people started coming over with casseroles and flowers for her passing. Someone even handed her flowers and told her they were sorry for her loss. she said she was super pissed at me for spreading false rumors and getting her in trouble with the school. Jimmy said he relayed the story of Douche Canoe to her but she asked why didn't I just call her? I told her I figured Jimmy would have and when it wasn't cleared up I assumed it true.So yeah, we still get some laughs out of it. I don't talk to Charlie anymore but I do Jimmy and we always bring it up whenever we feel something is too stupid, not as stupid as going to the wrong funeral right?

So once upon a time... When I was 19 I went on my first with my family. It was myself, a cousin, my sister and her husband, and my parents. Because neither of us were 21 or married, my cousin and I couldn't share a room so she and Mom were on the books as being in one room and Dad and I in another, then we just switched. This left my cousin's luggage coming to my parent's room and my dad's luggage going to ours. We got on the ship early and was waiting for our luggage to arrive when this guy comes by and said, "There's a problem with Edward's (my father) luggage and you can pick it up on the first deck." So my mother, my sister Treasure (yes, that's her real, legal name) and I went to the lower deck to get Dad's luggage. We get to the 1st deck and walk down this long hallway to an open area where we see a guard standing at a little podium. We tell him why we're there and he goes to retrieve the luggage. He sets the suitcase up on the podium and explains that something was detected during the scan and asks if he can look through it. My mother agrees, stating it's her husband's luggage, and the guard goes to work. He puts on these thick, purple, needle gloves and opens the bag with the top facing us where we can't see what's inside. He looks in the bag, starts lifting things a little, and suddenly smirks saying "I think this is the problem," as he pulls a pair of pink, fuzzy handcuffs out of the bag, dangling them between his thumb and forefinger. Treasure and I immediately bust out laughing and start teasing Mom who is SUPER embarrassed. The guard explains it isn't a big deal, but its a safety concern and he will have to confiscate them. He goes on to say he'll give us a receipt and we can come back and claim them at the end of the cruise. Mom says, "He can come down here and get them his own damned self!" as Treasure and I keep laughing and teasing. We get the luggage and start making our way back to the rooms. By this time, the halls, which are like the halls in a hotel, are packed with other passengers trying to find their rooms. We get almost back to the room when this man comes RUNNING down the hall yelling and waving a paper. "Ma'am! MA'AM! You forgot the ticket for your fuzzy handcuffs!" The hall goes silent, she turns on him, and my 5 ft nothing, firecracker of a mom snatches the paper and says "Thank you," through gritted teeth. We open the door and go in, where Mom slams the paper on Dad's lap, goes in the bathroom, and slams the door. Dad looks at Treasure and I and we can't tell him what happened because we're laughing so hard. We mime for him to read the paper and as he reads fuzzy handcuffs he starts to laugh.Fast forward a few years later. I submitted that story to the radio to win a cake, card, and flowers for mother's day. Little did I know, they were reading the winners on air...and I used our names. We're an adoptive family so my mom was well known by doctors, lawyers, case workers, and the like, because of my little brother's special needs. She suddenly started getting calls from people she hadn't heard from in years, snickering and saying, "Fuzzy handcuffs?!"Well, a few years after that I started a government job where I had to have a federal security clearance and had to have an FBI interview. As part of the interview they asked if I'd ever been out of the country. I told the lady, who had started by telling me she was a little nervous as well as I was her first solo interview, that I'd been on that cruise. Then she asked the all-important question, "While you were out of the country, did you, or anyone you were with, have anything confiscated?"...So now there is an FBI record of the Fuzzy Handcuffs Story.A few years after that, I had to get another security clearance. As my mom says "This nice young man came to my home, asked if we were his parents, and said he needed to speak to us regarding his security clearance. He came in, very professional, but obviously a little tense and nervous, so I let him off the hook. 'So I take it you've heard about the handcuffs?' as he cracks a smile he simply says '...There are stories' "

There was 3 jeeps one in the middle surrounded by trucks then the other two jeeps. They were heading to a small town that had some enemy sightings and there task was to clear it out while they were driving a explosion went off at the front then the back ( major safety issue for the trucks they didn�t have bullet proof window like the jeeps had) then the drivers of the trucks were getting shot at the Allie soldiers jumped out and shot in the direction the thought the soldiers were at and took cover then a soldier saw a enemy soldier come out of cover with a RPG and taking aim he shouted what he saw to the other soldiers and they started shooting the enemy soldier and killed him but then a soldier was shot in the head by a enemy sniper and was killed then a enemy soldier came out of no where and grabbed the RPG and fired killing some of the soldiers the surviving soldiers ran into the town dodging the enemy fire. When they got to the town they when on top of a house looking over the citizens when they saw the enemy�s coming they ducked down and looked through a little crack and saw a soldier being dragged down the street and a soldier said �Das passiert englischen Soldaten, wenn sie sich mit uns anlegen� translation � this is what happens to English soldiers when they mess with us� as they said this they pulled out a pistol and shot the soldier in the head then they started shooting at the citizens then a black hawk chopper came flying over but the enemy�s just shot at it and shot it down. The soldiers took aim from their cover and shot at enemy�s killing most of them and the others took cover some of the allies were tasked as the others were shooting to throw grenades over so that helped a lot but one of the enemy�s notice and said to his partners "Sie sind da dr�ben auf dem Dach" translation �they are over there on the roof� so the enemy�s started fighting back and shot a soldier throwing a grenade hitting him in the eye. A medic up on the roof gave him a shot of morphine and bandages up his eye and he then got out a gun and started shooting then the soldiers heard "Hallo stinkende briten, die du nicht mal halten kannst" translation �hello foolishBritain�s  you cant even keep guard� and then he grabbed his pistol and grabbed a Allie soldier and placed him in a choke hold and put the gun to his head but then he got shot in the head by the wounded soldier � hahaha idiot German what a hypocrite tells us to keep guar when he didn�t� then the shooting stoped then a Allie soldier looked through the crack and saw the German soldiers peeping over the cover so the Allie soldiers took the opportunity to kill the German soldiers then a chinook escorted be four black hawks then a rocket hit the chinook making in hit a building the black hawks then fired at were the rocket came from then one of the black hawks hovered over the soldiers low enough for the soldiers to hop in then another black hawk hovered over the crashed chinook and dropped a rope and some soldiers repealed down and lifted up the survivors then they started to fly away but then the soldiers were looking out and then a rocket hit one of the black hawks and when it had crashed the survivors were dragged out by enemy German soldiers who got a machete out and slices of there heads

This is about my grandson who is a beautiful soul with Autism. Another day of sneaking downstairs to grab a quiet cup of coffee before I have to start my day.Another day of a dreaded routine that he has created to make himself feel safe.Another day of watching his facial expressions and his body language to understand his needs. Another day of meltdowns and anger stricken cries, reenacting every movie that he sees, loud noises hurt his ears yet he screams.The disapproving� looks I get in public with every robotic sound that comes out of his mouth. Another day feeling grateful that he loves me so much, his silly looks, his constant hugs and kisses, his sense of humor, him playing dead so I pretend to cry and kiss him all over his face. The new words he comes up with that aren't understood by others, "but I understand them." Another day of wondering if I'm doing everything right when it feels like I'm doing everything wrong. Another day of kissing him goodnight and hoping he stays in bed, and as I fall asleep I say to myself... I hope I have another day.I am blessed to be raising my grandchildren..

There was a 11th grade Assembly thing and when they were taking up questions, the last question was, from a lady "Why is it with dress code girls get sent home but all you tell the boys is 'pull your pants up'?" and then the theatre arts room filled up with clapping. Me and my friend were dumbfounded, tbh. Then me and friend whisper to each other about how certain dress code situations can be fixed on the spot and others can't. I don't care if you don't believe me.

When we were playing this, I was with my friends Ashley and Greg. People told me not to play this game but I was a reckless girl that time. So we were in the elevator and we pressed buttons to the first, fourth, second and sixth floor. When Ashley pressed the button to the second floor, I sighed in relief. The fifth floor was usually where the woman comes in. But I realized we had to press the button to the fifth floor after. We did and the woman DID went on the elevator. As Ashley was about to press the button for the first floor, the woman asked what floor we were going to. Of course, we ignored her but she asked again in a sour tone, �Um, what floor are you going to?� We ignored her once again and the woman finally yelled, �Hey, I�m talking to you kids! Are three of you deaf?!�We still didn�t answer. We were glad we survived at the game but I had this feeling that the woman was haunting us now. If you heard people who had play the game advise you not to play it, please listen to them. Because they are right. They�ve played it before. It�s all because the experience will be creepy, it would be quiet and all you�ll hear are the elevator and pressing of button sounds and stuff. And it�s dark. I started having nightmares about that time.

This was a couple years ago now but has been stuck in my head the last few days. So I was 16 at the time and working my first job. Living in Florida, I found myself working on a river (won�t disclose for privacy reasons for myself and company) where we did canoe and kayak rentals. It was already a pretty crappy job being paid under the table and crazy hours. Our normal schedule was from 6 am until 5pm or when the last rental came back. We usually had those last few stranglers who would push the time until we went out and rounded them up but it never took too much longer. This weekend was near the end of summer & 5 o clock came around and we still had 1 rental missing. We did our normal rounds and didn�t find anything so waited a while longer. Around 6:30 we decide to take the motor boat up river to see if we could find anything. About 5 minutes upstream, we see a canoe with 2 people passed out and one person tangled in vines next to it. We rush over and we notice right away they were obviously on drugs and we�re having a bad trip or high (never confirmed what they were on). We pull them all into the motor boat and rush back to the main hub. I was the only one who knew anything about CPR from a HS class I (kinda) payed attention in. So I�m freaking out inside trying to keep this kid alive who is already ghostly white and foaming from the mouth. This continues for the next couple minutes until an ambulance arrives and takes over for me. As he�s loaded up and getting ready to be transported I�m still sitting there watching as I hear EMS state � he has no vitals� (something along that line this was years ago) and a defibrillator being used. I went home after this not saying a word about it to my parents and quit the next weekend.

On June 4th, 2015, the boy faded out.  It was my best friend Tommy Jamison � he was only ten years old when it happened. We had ridden our bikes to Cambridge park and left them by the pond so we could explore the muddy creek by the dam. I had to tell the police this story a thousand times, so here�s one more: he faded out. He stopped walking and looked up at the sky, then suddenly the color of his skin and his clothing all turned gray, then for a moment he was transparent. Then he was gone.Nobody believed me at first but luckily the park has security cameras and they captured his fading out. Still the police and all sorts of FBI agents questioned me and every nutjob on the Internet has a theory about me committing the perfect crime, about how I must have manipulated the security camera footage or created some sort of invisibility cloak like Harry Potter. But they�re wrong, he just faded out.Someday somebody will figure out what happened to my friend. Hopefully it won�t happen to me, I don�t want to fade out.

Yesterday I was playing Tony Hawk game for nostalgia and he did a spin with his skate board. I thought �I could do that� and went it side to try it. I was able to jump off the board successfully but the board went in the air too. The board landed on its side so the wood was facing forward the sky. I landed back first on the skateboard and my 9 year old sister was outside with me. I screamed SHIT and my sister went and told my parents. I am now sitting in my room with my whole side black and they don�t know I have my phone.

So, I'm currently a 9th grader. In the summer I've promised myself that I won't go after the girls in High School and I'll just study. So...Yes in November, I found out, that a very cutie girl in my class (she was my ideal) had a huge crush on me, so I got together with her, and she loved me so much, I totally fell into her. Basically this lasted around 1,5 months, before we first broke up in new year's eve. The reason was, that she tought I'm some kind of fuckboy (I've had  MANY girl friends, and I loved all of them, and almost spent more time with them, than gf)  So we had a discussion, and she broke up with me 5 days later. I was sickly into her, and I was totally deavastated. Only a very good girl friend of mine helped me out of it (Let's call her K), who aswell had a huge crush on me, and gf was very jealous at her, even after we broke up. So, after we broke up, we didn't talk much, but after 2 weeks, she wrote on me: MyFePo... fuck It, I LOVE YOU. Long story short, I got together with her again, but K started to sabotage this, betrayed me several times,then cried on my shoulder, that she didn't mean to.I don't want to hurt her that much, so I care about her, but I kinda hate her now. So.. She made us have a little break from this problematic relationship. (Again, I was even more devastated, and now betrayed by my best friend) but now we hade a real good, and close friendship with ex-gf (Let's call her P from now on) . So, 1,5 months passed, and she stated, that maybe we should remain friends. At the time, I was in hospital for psychological reasons, and by the next day... I LOST ALL MY MEMORIES ABOUT MY WHOLE CLASS.Seem's like I've had a trauma, and due to that, I've lost all my memories associated with the cause of the trauma (probably P). Everything you've heard now, comes from my friends, and I don't remember it at all. I don't remember my best friends. I've had a ,,secret'' best friend (I'll call her V) who just showed up, and tried to help me with this amnesia + cried 2 days straight, that I lost all memories about her too.&#x200B;Someone explain wtf is going on, I have like 15 people worried about my conditionn crying because of me, and I literally don't know them. I've been assigned to many psychologists now.And I'm like: The fuck is happening right now. I've got random people showing up at my doorstep claiming, that they are really good friends of mine. And I don't know any of them.

I am in high school, and my AP Language Arts teacher, Ms K, is insane. She has a very fake smile, speaks extremely slowly and no word or movement gets past her. She is extremely strict, especially on phones.Yesterday we were in class and she was droning on and on about something, when she notices my friend get a device out of his pocket. She yells at him to put his phone away, but he tries to protest. She gets mad at him and he eventually puts it away after checking it again and Ms K continues with the lesson. During the work period, my friend goes up to her and quietly explains that he has type 1 diabetes and has an insulin pump, he wasn�t feeling well so he was checking his blood sugar to make sure it was at a safe level. Ms K told him �I am so sorry, but don�t do it again� and then continued on with class.TL;DR: diabetic student told to �put away phone� by unreasonable teacher. When teacher told that he was checking his blood sugar on his insulin pump, she apologized but told him to never do it again.

Hey, this is my first submission on this subreddit and it's one of my favorite stories to tell to friends. (It's a long one)A little backgroundSo the year was 2006, my group of 4 four friends and I loved counter strike source. We were in 8th grade at the time and my friend Max created a counter strike clan called the Republic of Maxico. We didn't really get any members besides us and a couple of other people from school but we got damn good at the game and started entering local tournaments. Soon enough high school rolled around and we didn't have that much time for video games. We were still friends and we kept the Republic of Maxico going for some reason. We eventually started calling the people in our friend group Maxicans and hailing Max as a god, we did it for a joke and to mess with people.    When Max's birthday rolls around I shit you not one of my other friends made us matching uniforms. They looked like World War 2 German and British uniforms combined. We decided that every Friday we were going to all wear our uniforms to school. We did it as a joke and started speaking in heavy German accents.     Eventually we start making pranks on teachers and other students. We started speaking in Spanish so not everyone would be able to understand.     We made it through the first year of high school pulling off about six or seven pranks none of which were important enough. We decide that if we want to start pulling some serious pranks we have to meet together frequently to discuss these things. We start wearing our uniforms to the meetings and continue with the Republic of Maxico as the title of our group. We also learned German as our parents weren't to keen on us pulling pranks and we wanted to send messages to eachother and speak without anyone else knowing what we were doing.      It's the last day of summer and it's our last meeting. My friend Bobby brings over red arm bands with a white circle in the middle. They look like Nazi armbands but instead of a swastika it has the flag of the isle of man with the legs replaced with arms. It was weird but we wore it anyway.     First day of Sophomore year. We show up in our borderline nazi uniforms. It was epic. We decided that for some of our larger pranks to work we were going to have to become student president. Over the summer we made many campaign posters and prepared many class speeches. However, the issue was, we weren't popular. I mean, we called ourselves Mexicans because of a video game clan, (not on a cool video game like call of duty) but on counter strike. We wore Nazi esk uniforms and spoke German.     It was voting day, everyone would write who they wanted to win on a slip of paper and put it in a box. We knew we weren't going to win. We had the best campaign but we were far too nerdy to win. At lunch lord Max (as we now called him) ordered us to steal the election box and rig the election. Asking him how we were going to do this provided what was one of the greatest ideas Max ever had during his rule.      He said "The box is right by the principles office, and distracting a principle is far too easy. But we need something big enough so that you guys will have the time to steal it. We're massive nerds so one of you guys needs to volunteer to provoke a jock or something and start a fight right now, then when they're both there steal the box." I stepped in. I was going to get beat up. I cried "F�R MAXICO!" I then tripped an especially mean jock who hated us. Apparently he was not having a good day. He fucking yelled at me right there.     "WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?! I AM YOUR DOOM! I WILL KILL YOU RIGHT THE FUCK NOW IF YOU DON'T APOLOGIZE!" he screamed something along those lines. I just said "hey man sorry for tripping you, but you should watch where you're going next time."    A sharp pain in my nose.    He fucking sucker punched me right in the nose. HELL YEAH! I had a bloody nose but it was worth it. After I was cleaned up at the nurses office him and I went to the principles office. I told the principle what happened and again apologized to him. The principle gave the guy three weeks detention and I got off scot free. Walking outside the principles office I was something. That something was that the box wasn't there.      Ohmyfuckinggodtheplanworked.     Max invited us all to his house where the box was proudly presented. He made us handle it with gloves. Fucking gloves so we didn't get prints on it. We spent easily three hours down there forging Max's name. We made him win by like six votes or something, so it didn't look to suspicious. We bleached the box and cleaned it as hard as we could to get rid of anything that could be traced to us.      The next day roles around and the principle is freaking the fuck out. She has no idea where the box is. Perfection. We notice one of the Jock's lockers is open. We stuff the box inside while nobody was looking and lock it. Luckily the Jock's are at some out of state football tournament thing at the time.      The teachers started doing locker checks two days later. They found the box. For some reason the didn't take out the vote despite finding the box in a student's locker. Max is president.     If you want me to continue the story comment please!

Once when I was twelve, I was at a two week long swim camp. They had pretty OK food but it was not great. On the first day, I decided to eat some of their questionable pizza. I thought nothing of it when I was eating.But later that night, I briskly walked to the bathroom with the most explosive shit on the entire planet. As I walked to the bathroom, I could feel my asshole burning from the shit it was holding back. By the time I had reached the nearest toilet, I was wincing at the pain from my ass. Right as my ass cheeks hit the toilet seat, I felt something I had never felt before. It was the force of 10 fire hoses right out of my ass. The stream of shit continued for over thirty seconds. It took over ten pieces of double layer two ply toilet paper to successfully clean my ass.When the nightmare was over, I slowly walked back to my bed as to make sure to not shit myself again. My room mate asked me what had happened. I told him to never ask and to tell no one of what he had heard.

I'm 16 and I was fifteen when this happened. My best friend is..... Well to put it politely wild. I'll call her A. A drinks, smokes, has sex with guys and girls over the age of eighteen. All while her parents know about it. I'm the complete opposite. I make honor roll, I have a good relationship, I stayed friends with her because when we met she was nothing like this. Anyway, so one weekend A invited me over for the night. When I got there, I saw that her online 17/18 year old boyfriend was there. I practically begged A's mom to stay, because my house was 30 minutes from A's and I didn't trust her. Immediatly after she left. A and her Bf started guzzling down an unknown alcohol the BF has smuggled in, in an old lemonade bottle. They tried multiple times to get me to try it but I declined. After hours, of A smoking weed, drinking alcohol, and bumming nicotine. She began acting erratic. She started screaming about imaginary dogs and such. I tried to calm her down but she kicked me in the face so hard she chipped my tooth. Not to mention my lips were so swelled I looked like a Kardashian. I don't exactly rememeber all the details.  But as some point, I passed out. When I woke up, I was on the floor of A's parents bedroom, in a bra, right above me I saw her BF having sex with A. A seemed out of it and she probably was. I forced myself up and crawled out of the room as fast as I could. I stood up and fell again. I. Was. Out. Of it. I couldn't think of simple things like how to get out of the house. Thank god my BF texted me and brought me back to reality. Just as I was trying to find my shoes. A started vomiting uncontrollably. Every two seconds. She kept trying to go to sleep but I knew that was too dangerous. Despite what I felt, I propped her upright, and tried to help clean her up so she "wouldn't get in to trouble" all the while her BF is trying to get me to have sex with him. Skipping foward a bit. Her big brother came home to find that A was still puking her guts out. Instead of telling her brother what actually happened and get her BF in trouble she said she was trying to kill herself. At this point, an ambulance is here, it's 3 a.m,  my face is bleeding, I have no shirt, I decide, fuck it Im gonna run home. I tried every door until eventually I slid under the garage and sprinted out into the street. Where thank god an off duty uber driver guy picked me up. Normally, I wouldn't have gotten into stranger's car but I didn't know what else to do. He helped me into the car, gave me water, and offered to take me to the hospital or where ever I needed to go. He ended up taking me home and I explained everything to mom. Later on, A's Bf somehow got my number and started texting me about having sex with him all the while A is at the hospital. That night is so traumatizing to me. That's why I will never drink underage I don't want that happening to me. Also thank god for that uber driver. I wish I could thank him more. I was so distorted I don't even know what I said to the man.

It was night time and I was climbing into my bed at about 2:30 am because I didn't want to go to bed. I drift off to sleep rather quickly and before I know it I awaken from my slumber to a small thud. I thought that it was my imagination as this has happened before and went back to sleep. Then before I drift into a mini coma, I wake up to light movements that pierce my eardrums like a mega drill. I quickly sit up in my bed and look around, I saw a few of my amiibos off of my desk and on the floor. I bent over to pick them up and I realize that they have no bases on the  bottom of them. I quietly whisper "what the fuck" and suddenly, my Luigi turns it's head to look at me. I freak the fuck out and MEGA YEET my Luigi amiibo at the wall. The other amiibos turn to me and start chanting "You shouldn't have done that". I run out of my room and go upstairs and sit on the couch. After a bit my dog sees me and sits on the couch next to me. I pet him and I fall asleep. I'm awoken by my dog jumping off of me, and it starts barking at the floor. I look at the floor and I see my entire amiibo collection there with my god damn silverware. My dog then like a mad lad fucking mega rams all of them and them I go to bed thinking that I'm high on acid. This never happened again and I'm pretty happy about it. Dogs are truly mans best friend.

I was leaving a rave in east London at about 2am, I planned my route and kept my phone in my zip pocket and everything valuable in a rucksack. I got to my bus stop and three guys I saw earlier as i left the place came up to me. They made small talk with me and asked me where I was from, I had taken an edible so wasn't really suspicious of them. Then one of them asked *"What phone do you have?"*This when alarm bells went off and I backed off, they surrounded me telling me that no one at the bus stop would help me (they were right). One of the muggers said ***"I'm packing my shank"***I called bullshit on that one as I guessed he was trying to see how easily I would give my shit up. I stood my ground and looked him in the eyes, he counted *"5, 4, 3, 2,"*When he said 1 I pushed him back into the road, he ran at me and put his hand on my neck and pushed me against a metal fence. I kicked him in the stomach. He held onto my coat and said "someone shank this kid" (his friends weren't doing much, i'm quite a big guy, especially compared to them, so they were hesitant) in that moment I smacked the guy holding my coat in the eye and ran faster than I ever have. I made it to the next bus stop and got on and got home safely.Be careful out there guys xx

About a year ago, I was working overnights at a convenience store. Not the most glamorous job, but it paid the bills. One morning near the end of my shift, my boss came in and told me that the store down the street had a burglary. A kid, assumedly 8-10 years old, spilled a slushy on the floor, and as the cashier went to clean it, the kid went behind the counter, and grabbed as many packs of JUUL pods as his tiny hands could carry, then bolted out the door.I told my boss I'd be careful, but thought that there was no way anyone would be dumb enough to try the same stunt twice in the same week. Turns out I was wrong.The very next night, around midnight, a kid walked into my store, wearing a backpack. As a rule, I never tell people to leave their bags at the door, but that doesn't mean I wasn't suspicious of him. I greet the kid, and he goes for the fountain. I stay behind the counter, as I normally do so I'm ready to check out my customers when they come up, but this time it was more out of caution; I wasn't sure if this kid was the same one my boss warned me about, but he did match the description I was given.The kid came back, saying "I spilled my slushy all over the floor.""No worries, bud. I'll clean it up when I can."He looks at me expectantly. I'm visibly not busy, but I stay behind the counter wearing a shit-eating grin. I wasn't gonna be outsmarted by a kid like the poor sap down the street.The kid continued browsing the store, and I saw a car pull in front of a gas pump. No one came out, they just sat there. It dawned on me that this was likely the kid's getaway vehicle. The brat approached me again. "Sir, it's making a big mess..."I simply nod, and at this point, I decide to call the police. I knew that they couldn't do anything if nothing happened, but I also knew that they probably had security footage from the store that this kid stole from, so it might be important for them to know that the kid tried hitting this store as well. The kid left, and, much to my surprise, walked out to the vehicle that pulled up. I saw a middle finger through one of the windows before the vehicle vanished from sight.The police collected the footage and told me to call if he came back, since understandably boys his age aren't supposed to be by themselves that late at night. My boss looked over the footage and confirmed my suspicions. Apparently, his "friends" sent him in to steal from behind the counter for them. Cowards. Kid probably just wants friends, but is hanging out with the wrong crowd.

It was the last day of school and for me the last day in the country. I started reminding myself of the all the memories I had made in the school. Me and my family change countries every 6 years or so and it was time to change again but this time it was somewhat different.I never really got too close to friends in a country but this time I was really connected to them. All the sports events I had won with my friends, all the time we were given parties by people on there birthdays, how we were always backstage on every event and assembly and all the classes we had missed to plav volleyball .As the year was ending we had gotten our results and report cards, my results were average but as I was leaving I caught sight of my best friend, Rose {not her real name} I went over to talk to her and then hugged her one last time.It was a moment of happiness as well as sadness as both of us had shared great memories but also the fact that we would probably never meet again.I encourage and advise all of you to make the best of your time with your friends and family because you never know the last time you will see them.

hello all, ive been wanting to tell this story but i struggled finding an appropriate subreddit for it. i think this one is my best bet haha. Last week, I got to spend the week in Charleston with my best friend. Her and I have been friends pretty much our entire lives, let's call her R. On the last night I was there, R and I decided to stay up late, play uno, and watch YouTube like we always do when we have sleepovers. It hit 2 AM, and after we finished a round of Uno I found myself getting hungry. I asked R if she was hungry, and she said yes. I remembered that she had a can of green beans in the pantry, so i asked her if she'd want to split the can. She agreed, so I went downstairs to make the green beans. This is where things went downhill, and fast. I went downstairs and I noticed R's little brother in the living room which was next to the kitchen. He asked me what I was doing and i explained I was going to make some green beans. I get the can, then the can opener, and try to open it. I got about halfway around the lid until i turned it the wrong way and i struggled to get the opener going again. I asked the little brother for help, and I didn't consider the fact that he's 11. He is able to get it going, and as I'm getting a bowl for the beans i hear the sound of light metal hitting the counter. I turn around and I see the brother with can opener in one hand, and can in the other, and 2 gears on the counter next to him. He managed to break the can opener. But I wasn't going down without a fight.I got a knife and tried to cut the rest open manually (It was 2 AM. Give me a break.) But ended up bending the tip of the knife, so I grab a fork and try to use leverage to open it. This didn't work out very well. So what does my dumbass do? I grab the can lid with my index finger and thumb (it was 2 AM. Give. Me. A. Break.) Inevitably, my thumb slipped against the rim of the lid, and my thumb started gushing blood. The cut was pretty deep, and I looked at the brother and repeatedly said "Bandaid. I need bandaid." While he went to get a bandaid, I noticed that the can was open enough to get the green beans out, so i pour them into a bowl and I got really, really upset. They weren't green anymore.They were red from the blood. The brother comes back with a bandaid, and thanks to the mix of it being 2 AM and the fact i had too much caffeine, when i saw the blood on the beans i started crying. He hands me the bandaid, and looks at me with a puzzled expression. I point to the bowl and he looks at it. He looks at me with an even stronger puzzled expression, then walked back to the living room to watch a movie. In the end, we never had green beans because there was only one can. My friend had to comfort me as I cried at the loss of the tastee snacc.

I�m currently on a 4 months trip through Asia with my boyfriend and two weeks ago we went to an internet cafe.  There were not a lot of people but across from my PC sat a man and when I was randomly looking through the room, I saw IT! I could see between the monitor and the desk that he masturbated. I was so shocked I didn�t know what to do, and moments like that are always like an accident - you don�t want to look but you do it anyway.A few minutes later another man came into the caf� and sat down 3 seats next to him. I was glad because he stopped first but after 10 minutes or so he continued! How disgusting is that?! :DI also want to mention that Malaysia has a lot of muslims (60%) and I would have never thought that I would experience anything like that here at a public place. Did anyone had an experience like that, too?

 So i am on mobile and my first language is Romanian so bare with me&#x200B;So this winter my girlfriend had a family reunion at her house it happened that she was sick and had a fever Now she told me that her parents were wearing thick hoodies and pants cuz it was cold there in Canada and they didn't have dry wood to heat up the house (yes they had a fireplace that heated the whole house again i'm Romanian feel free to roast me for not knowing the word).She was weaeing some short pants and a sports bra&#x200B;Fast forward to where the EM and EK appear I'm sure ya know what Em , Ek and Gf mean so i'm not gonna waste your time&#x200B;Well Ek enterd her room while she was doing some freelancer work (both my gf and me are working as freelancers but she as a painter and i as a programmer) Of course she was dressed like she was at the start of the story and she quickly pulled a blanket over her and told EK she is working then she closed the door&#x200B;EK kicked the door and went to his mother&#x200B;In comes EM the spawn of Satan and starts going off on my gf when she sees how she was dressed.While Em was exploding EK saw her drawing tablet(a Huion H420 in case you are wondering) and started pressing hard with the pen and he broke it. My gf saw it and went to it fortunately she had a new tab opened to make another character(the guy who contacted her wanted an anime guy as the main character) and she switched to the one she drew firstly. EM exploded once again (she was religious as fuck) but this time she was screaming about how my girlfriend would rot in hell cuz she is worshiping Satan (Can you believe it the spawn of Satan said someone is worshiping Satan) at this point my gf was crying since she was being called a whore by some stupid racist bitch (yes there were some racist comments since my gf is asian) that was apart of her family.&#x200B;My gf's father came in the room and screamed at EM to take her little shit and leave right then and there.&#x200B;Well found out Em was a single mom and Em's husband left her because of many incidents where she made her kid steal.&#x200B;There was a kind of happy ending since i gave her my pen from a Huion 420 (not the same but the H420 has 3 express keys) cuz i was trying to be a freelancer in both digital painting and programming&#x200B;Sorry if this turns out to be too long remembered the story only now and my gf didn't tell me the real dialogue only the short version&#x200B;I have more stories but they would have to be posted on [r/entitledpeople](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledpeople/) since me and my gf went to a high school with mostly rich people&#x200B;Have a good day and hope you get your Karen repellent cuz encountering these people is a pain in the ass&#x200B;This story is a repost from r/mystory but it is my own story on both subreddits

So I'm a freshman going to be a sophomore. School ends in less than a week and everyone is anticipating summer. Well one boy in my grade got out early because HE TOOK A FUCKING FAT SHIT IN THE BATHROOM SINK. He's now suspended till November. He just got back from a two day suspension because he was caught vaping in class. I know for a fact his mom spanked him with a cheese board for that cause I'm friends with his sister so I can oy imagine what he got spanked with this time

So in elementary school I used to sell those Rainbowloom bracelets. If you�re unaware what that is, they�re bracelets made of colorful small rubber bands braided and tied together in certain ways. Anyways, I made some good money off of them in the 3rd grade. I got about $40 in total.My family & I all went to the flea market one day. I saw a cage of black bunnies, and was dying to have one. So I asked my Dad who replied �You can have one, if you can pay for it.�This was always his response to me asking him for stuff, as it was a way of saying �no� because I never had money. But I did have money... and so I bought it. The only gray rabbit in the cage, happy as day. She�s still with me to this day, we�re goin on 6 years. My Dad liked to tell the story, and laugh about it. Given how his own words came back and bit him :)

I was scrolling through the front page today and found a r/jackoffconfessions post. I decided to go more into the sub and found one post about a girl (legal age) who was so horny and fucked some dude while he was sleeping. all the comments were so negative and hating and one person even linked it to r/rapeconfessions . Upon entering this horrifying sounding subreddit, I came across one post about a girl whos dad wanted to rape her. To my surprise, all the comments were about how the story was so hot and how they hope she got fucked or raped. Don't go there. It's terrible.

When I was younger my parents thought I was either drunk high or both because of the food combinations I would make. Such as a POUND of salamis and 2 pistachio muffins (I ate both and it was delicious) but the first time I was offered drugs was surprising and I said no, when I told my dad he said �u weren�t already on them?�Still one of my favorite stories to tell at family reunions

The other day, while with my friend, I came across a field near my house I didn't know existed. We decided to make a walk out of it and we continued up that way. We walked for about 15 minutes when we smelt campfire. Since the day was lovely we both remarked something about a BBQ in this area being a good idea. Wanting to know where the smoke was coming from, to know the best area to set up shop if we ever decided to do it we began looking. Didn't take long to find it, there was a small gathering and open fire, we could hear them, smell the fire and see the smoke.   Here's where things get weird - the way the field was set up it has several areas that are separated by hedges. The campfire group were by the corner of one of those hedged off areas. Nearby there was an entrance to what we thought was that area . But when we stepped through the entrance we couldn't see neither the fire, nor the smoke. We couldn't smell the fire or hear the group they just ceased to exist. And not because we stepped to the wrong field they just sort of disappeared. A little freaked out we stepped outside that area and again to the place where we observed the fire before and it was there again. We thought we perhaps walked into the wrong field but further inspection of the hedges we decided that wasn't possible.   We made a couple of jokes about alternate reality but decided to walk on and forget about it. Except I couldn't. I went there again today. As I was walking I half expected to just walk past an empty field, inspect the hedges, find the actual spot of the campfire and prove I just have an overactive imagination. Except that's not what happened. once again there was a campfire, in that exact spot. I really didn't want to blow it out of proportion since again it's the weekend could have been another BBQ. But as i walked closer it vanished. Not because it was obscured by a hedge it just vanished while I was mid looking at it. I took few steps back and it appeared again in the same spot.   Heavily freaked out I went home and haven't stopped thinking about it since.

This happened to me in year 6 (when I was around 10-11 years old). I swear on my life everything in this story is true, I have not made a single bit up. This is definitely the most interesting and fiction-like story I�ve been through.I had recently done my 11+ exams in year 6 and therefore the whole year celebrated by going on a school trip towards the north of England to a place called PGL. PGL was essentially an activity centre for school trips with lots of outdoor activities like abseiling, rock climbing, zip-lining etc. The whole trip was fun but then it got to the last night of the stay where the whole story took place. The entire year group stayed in a mansion with four-five people in every room depending on the size of the room. We had just been to a party with the whole yeargroup where I had been hanging out with my friend Oscar the entire time.Once we got back we were told to sit in a relatively small room with no furniture and a grey carpet. The teachers told us how three of the students in our year had been sick and gone up to the medical room. They said that it could just be coincidence but there may be a sickness bug travelling around and to tell the teachers if we felt ill.I looked around and realised my friend Oscar was no-where to be seen, he was one of the first to be sick...I immediately start panicking and feel sick when a boy named Joseph walks up to me and asks �are you ok?�At this point, I breathe heavily and realise that I�m only feeling ill due to the placebo effect. I say that I�m fine and we all go up to our rooms in our groups where we prepare for bed.As we�re walking upstairs, we walk past a puddle of vomit being cleaned up by an employee of PGL.We get into our rooms which included me, Kieran and 2 Louis�. We prepare for bed when ginger Louis leaves the room to go to the bathroom to brush his teeth. He comes back horrified and tells us not to go out there. Of course, being the curious boys we were, all ran out to see for ourselves what Louis was taking about. I was last out and the three other occupants of my room ran back past me and said I�d regret turning the corner.... and boy were they right!I immediately was overwhelmed with the stench of vomit as I turned the corner into the corridor where I saw what made me think the zombie apocalypse had finally happened. Around 50 out of the 60 kids in the year were all sat down in the hall, slouching on the walls and passed out on the floor, all vomiting and coughing uncontrollably.The medical room was full and so the sick kids were told to wait outside where they just kept piling up. Needless to say, I didn�t brush my teeth that night.However, the story does not end there, late at night, all four of us quarantined ourselves in our room to keep away from the disease when five other students walked in and I shit you not... one of the students named George said �YES, WE FOUND SURVIVORS!�Turns out that our room and their room were the only two rooms who hadn�t been infected which means 51 out of the 60 students on the trip had a sickness bug.Once they left, everything quietened down and we all went to sleep when we must�ve been woken up at around 3:00am by the sound of non-ginger Louis vomiting by our room door and rushing out.We all quickly sprinted up, covered our mouths and thought �we�re fucked�That was probably the longest night of my life.End result: No one else was infected and I was one of the 8/60 students who survived the apocalypse.

Here's a little context before I begin. Every morning I walk like 5 minutes from home to my bus stop at Taco Bell for school. Three different buses arrive at 3 different times. I take the last bus so I have plenty of time to get ready and walk. Recently I have started leaving a lot earlier so I could eat breakfast there. I get there about 15 minutes before the second bus arrives, and 30 minutes before MY bus arrives, that way I can hangout with my friends that ride the second bus. Normally after the second bus leaves its just me and another kid, but this morning a customer shows up at about the same time the second bus leaves. This is how it went down. Creepy Customer = CC    Me = MeSo CC shows up (he looks like he's in maybe his mid 20's) and orders his food. He's really tall, loud, and talkative. After he finished ordering he started talking to the cashier about when they open, and other weird pointless stuff like that, which sorta caught my attention. CC then waits, gets his food, and sits down to eat.Outside there is this weird tractor looking vehicle I guess tilling the grounds? Whatever it was it got my attention so I went up to the window and watched for a second. CC: Did you miss your bus? Me: (I look at him) What? CC: (again) Did you miss your bus. Me: Oh no, haha. I was looking at this tractor thing out side. My bus isn't here yet. CC: Oh, a tractor? Huh weird. There was this awkward silence for the next 10 seconds. I wasn't really uncomfortable talking to him because he didn't look like a bad guy but I wasn't about to get Ted Bundy'd. CC: You go to (insert my schools name) right? It didn't even occur to me that he knew the name of my school so without thinking I responded with.. Me: Yeah, that's right. CC: Oh, if you happened to miss the bus I was gonna offer to shoot you a ride but that's kind of weird, haha. Me: (extremely uncomfortable at this point) Yeah that would be kind of weird. *forced laugh*At this point I'm back to sitting down at a Taco Bell table, innocently playing Sims on my phone, trying to end the conversation inconspicuously but he wouldn't stop talking. Eventually he did leave me alone and started talking to the other kid in Taco Bell. They were talking about embarrassing "missing the bus" stories.Now that I look back at it, it doesnt sound that bad but the fact that he brought up taking me to school 30 minutes away kind of struck me. I figure that if I asked he would... "Deliver." So I figured no better way to share the story is on Reddit. TL;DR: Some random guy asks if he wants him to take me to school. I say no. I'm scared. Ted Bundy. Spooderman evaporates. Thank you for reading.

So, to start off, I have to explain some background with this guy (I'll call him Jimbo). We met last year at school, both enrolled in a technical program that was in the same building all day, several days a week. We started talking and by the end of the year I had had sex with this guy, before and a couple of months after I got married. I know it was stupid; and it had nothing to do with my significant other, it was just destructive behavior on my part.I called it off several months prior, and had lost all interest in Jimbo. I still tried to get along with him, and to be honest, when he was nice I had a good time joking with him. The problem was that Jimbo kept trying to pursue me sexually, and when I would tell him no, he would lash out at me calling me a bitch and insinuating that I was leading him on.Jimbo kept taking conversations in a sexual direction, and asking me inappropriate questions. I didn't go to my instructor about this because Jimbo would go over a week between incidents, and I (nievely) hoped that he would get that I wasn't interested at all and move on. At one point he even told me that he was pursuing someone via tinder (didn't pan out, he claimed she was boring), and even bragged to me that he would be getting laid one weekend. Jimbo's behavior was becoming more irregular, sometimes going from a nice person to an asshole within a span of five minutes. The last two weeks I have been uncomfortable around Jimbo for extended periods of time, mainly because I didn't want him to grab me when my hands were busy.The weather has been nasty the last several weeks, and this last Wednesday was no exception. Problem is that I wasn't dressed properly for the snow (it was falling heavily, and so wet that it was freezing on the road) that wasn't there at all when I left for school that morning, and since my knees have been hurting because of chronic pain I really didn't want to walk for 20 minutes to the bus stop. Most of the other students had left, so I begrudgingly asked Jimbo for a ride into town, planning to meet my significant other at a store for some shopping. I figured that if Jimbo tried anything, it would be a hand on myy thigh or something so I'd be able to deal with it easily; and besides, it was a short drive so what could go wrong?Shortly after Jimbo had started driving, he had to pull over to change into four wheel drive. He didn't start driving till after I got out of the vehicle.�Thirty minutes of assult. I was trying to push him off, punched him in the dick several times, and even gave him a weggie from hell to try to get him off of me. He only seemed to enjoy it. At one point he moaned my name while he was straddling my waist and thrusting.He looked at me as if he loved me. He complemented the look and smell of my hair. He bit my neck, and liked my face. He tried to grab my junk.The only reason it stopped was because someone knocked on the driverside window. If that man hadn't it's likely I would have been raped.�I literally rolled out of the passenger side door, grabbed my backpack and phone and stood trying to keep from loosing it until Jimbo drove off. I moved out of the way of the other car and the man drove off.�I started freaking out, quickly called my SO to ask them to pick me up, and started walking twords the campus and Jimbo called me, I declined him, and then he texted me and I didn't read it.After about a minute of walking Jimbo drove up to me and offered to drive me straight to the store... I told him no, and that I just wanted my glasses back, which had come off in the struggle. He dug for them in his car, gave them back, and gave me a weak-ass sorry before driving away the last time.�Looking back, he was a tool and a total nice guy, but all he can be changed with is a misdemeanor. I have had panic attacks, this has fucked with my depression, sleep, appetite, and my ability to consetrate and do my work in class. And it's a fucking misdemeanor.Update: I finally got a protection order, which has helped, especially at school, but it's still hard.

So I was in a Boy Scouts Troop and we were doing a typical visit to Washington DC touring historical building and what not. We decided to do a tour of the capital building and near the end of the tour some guy decided to protest something (have no idea what) by shooting himself on the steps of the capital building. He had a briefcase so they locked down the whole building and got a bomb squad to make sure the briefcase was safe trapping me and the rest of the Boy Scouts Troop inside for about an hour or so.

I lost my phone last night and ended up searching my house for 2 hours before giving up and going to sleep. I convinced myself that once I was calm and had cleared my mind by sleeping, I'd be able to find my phone easily. I feel asleep, and had a strange dream. In this dream, I remembered my lost phone, and reached into my pocket (I wasn't wearing pants irl, just in the dream) to check if my phone was there. It was. I was extremely relieved, but then I realized that this was just a dream, and that I didn't really find my phone. But I told myself off and made myself believe that it was absolutely there in real life as well.  I remember feeling almost as if I were ripping the phone out of my dream and into reality. I then woke up with my phone in my hand. I asked my family members if they'd found it and handed it to me while I was sleeping or something, but they said they hadn't seen it. I had searched the couch I slept on countless times the night before and had no luck, and there's no way I dug through the bottom of the couch in my sleep. I don't know how I did it, but believe it or not, I willed my phone into existence. 



******************************



I am in an airport bathroom with a friend, we'll call him Kyle. Some overly aggressive guy comes in and starts chirping to Kyle. Dont really remember what he was saying but Kyle is a smartass and says something stupid back. This turns into a pushing match, and I went over to break it up. Then as we're walking away the guy ran up and blindsided Kyle knocking him out. I jumped in and hit the other guy taking him down. Just so happened that airport security was taking a shit in the stall. He comes out after hearing all the ruckus going on happens to see only me assaulting the other guy, not the beginning of fight. He comes towards us in a rush and I start grabbing Kyle to get up  but the security guy grabbed him. So I kept running (which is stupid I know), hiding throughout the airport and somehow getting out and jumping in a random person's car being chased out and telling her to just drive. We were flying back home to O'hare from Nashville. So I was in a random girl's car on the run thinking how am I going to get home and out of this situation. Are we being followed?Absolutely freaking out, knowing I made everything worse by running. Then as we are driving, we see someone behind us on a motorcycle going like 100 mph. Behind him are like 5 Police cars chasing him and as he gets up next to us I look out the window and its fucking Kyle. He winks and puts a thumbs up out. and then soars away into the sky flying across the horizon. Literally in the sky like Hagrid from Harry Potter. And then I woke up from the most bizarre WTF dream I've had in a long time.

MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO TELL ME STORIES ABOUT �little blue people� AS A BEDTIME STORY AND IVE JUST REALIZED SHE WAS RETELLING STUFF ABOUT THE SMURFS THE WHOLE TIME 



******************************



Hey Reddit. First time poster here. Anyway I've seen some videos about r/entitledparents and all that stuff floating on YouTube and I wanted to share a story of something that happened to me.Wasn't sure where to post this. So here we go.Several years back, I'd like to say: 2014? I think it was 2014. So. I got my first part time-job thanks to a friend of mine who recommended me to the, at the time manager. Had the interview and got the position. (Car park security, not actual security tho.) Anyway friend also told me a week after the interview, the manager wanted to put me on right-away. But higher ups said no. But was told it's going to be during November to January-2015, The Christmas period. So the job was to manage the car park; redirect people in and around to different spots, if there was none left from where they were and watch the CCTVs.There's like a few screens to monitor, the entrance and exits if anyone tries to make a runner behind a car before the gate closes. We'll get their plates and all that for a report if they continue to be a repeat offender.Sometime in December, it was pretty busy and it was peak hour. During a certain time of day, mostly in the afternoon, one of us would go down to the levels of the entrance and exits of either ends. North, south, east and west. I was at Bay 0 south entrance/exit. So I went down there collecting tickets and letting people go, even if they over stayed the three hour free-parking limit.0-3 hrs free.3-3.5hrs $6 fine.3.5 - 4 $8 fine.6 hours+ to a lost ticket $20 fine.(But I think it has changed from 3 hours free parking to 5 hours free parking)The manager said not to worry about it if they've overstayed the free parking limit, just get the ticket and tell them to go out to get rid of the congestion. I was down there for about an hour I think. So the manager calls me on the CB walkie talkie to manually close the gate since there's no longer a congestion. I walk back up and 10 mins later. Enters the angry dad.(Forgot to mention, these gates also have a button to call us if anything is wrong)[M = manager, AD = Angry Dad, AM = Angry Mum/(Mom), YC = Young Child and finally me]*Beeeeep* (My manager answers the call. Also this device, when punched in some numbers with hash, can talk to other machines inside the centre and at the entrance/exits.)M: Hello, [Name of major regional shopping centre of security team] How can I help you?AD: Yeah mate, I put my ticket in and I can't get out.M: What do you mean? Is the ticket jammed?AD: (Irritatedly) Nah mate it says I have to pay a fine.M: Ah okay, so all you have to do is insert a Visa or debi-[M was cut off from talking and AD starts]AD: I don't have one, mate, nor does me misses.Hearing this, the M turns off the button for talking. And we look at each other like; 'how the fuck can these grown ass people not have either one of the card?'. But said nothing about it to them and M presses button down to talk again.M: Well okay sir, I'll have someone come down to collect the money, that'll be $6.AD: Why? How come?M: Well sir you've over stayed your free parking limit.AD: I didn't know there was a limit.M: Well sir, there's signs saying so before the gates.AD: Oh I didn't see them.Acting like he didn't know about the signs, when there's signs towards each gate, stating the limits and fines.(Note: We're not allowed to collect cash in hand to pay for fines, only cause in the past I was told that people would steal it, but this was an exceptional moment since he was holding up people from leaving).M: Hey TheSolidMidget, could you run down and get his money?Me: Sure thing.(To get to the car park, There's an elevator that takes you to ground level and there's a locked door that opens with a chip only access)I get there and said: I am here to pick up the money.AD (while handing me the money): Mate this is pretty fucked up, aye.Me: I'm sorry for the inconvenience, sir.(Remember how I mentioned about the call button at the gate? Well. It was still turned on, only we have the power to end the call)M: There's no need to apologise there, TheSolidMidget.(AD hear's this, I can see him turn a little red with rage and starts shouting, as I am standing next to the box to rest my arm)AD: **Shouting** OPEN THE FUCKIN' GATE YA CUNT!(Silence for a few seconds, as some of the other team members and M are monitoring the CCTVs and AD starts again)AD: [Punches the box and shouts again]OPEN THE FUCKIN' GATE YA CUNT!M: Sir, what did you just hit?AM: OPEN THE FUCKIN' GATE YA CUNT!And at this point I'm slowly backing away as the AD is still shouting. As I am slowly backing away. My eyes, catch eyes with their YC in the back, he gives me a sad look, could of been like 4.I've backed away about 4/5 meters. AD turns his head, looking back at me and says.AD: Mate, better get this fuckin' gate open, before I drop some cunt.I was the only cunt there.I'm not a tall person, nor am I strong, a little chubby tho. I'm like 5' something. (5'3/5'5) and this AD was clearly over 6ft.I go to my CB walkie talkie.Me: Hey M, can you get the gate open?(It doesn't go through)Me: Come on M, just get the fuckin' gate open.(It doesn't go through again)[AD gets out of the car]Me: Nah M, fuck this.(And it doesn't go through the third time).At that moment I legged it. I ran back to HQ, wasn't followed. Tho a little fat I was maybe 70kgs at the time. My running became sprinting for the elevator (Not to mention there's a camera in the elevator too which I was breathing heavily in) and got back there, fell to the ground on my knees and curled up into a ball, a few feet away from our room. Almost in tears and was deeply heavily breathing, chest pounding.My fellow work mates and M were watching the monitor taken from the CCTV, laughing at the fact I ran for my life. (Thanks guys, cheers)As I was there, the ladies who work at the call/transfer centre next door to us, were asking me if I was okay and or needed water, etc.I took a breather and had some water. Enters M with security guards.M: Why'd you run for you pussy?Me: AD said he was gonna fuckin' drop me.M: No he fucking wasn't.Me: Well how do you know?M: Well, you're okay. Take a break for 10 min.Me: Thanks MAs M left with a couple of security guards to deal with the AD. One of the ladies from the call centre/transfer stayed with me for a little while and asked me what happened?I told her what happened and she said: Yeah, I'd run away too.Wasn't sure what happened to him, wasn't told if he was banned from the centre or anything, maybe given a warning? Who knows?Hope you enjoyed that. I got some more work stories of that place and they're not as long as this one.Oh and, after my Christmas-part time finished, my mate, the one who helped got me my first job told me that they're still laughing about what happened to me. Great.

I was sitting on the roof of my apartment building six stories up, dangling my feet off the edge and eating my lunch (I like to be high up, I always find it calming) and after a bit I looked down and saw about twenty or thirty people and a cop car around the building staring at me and I had no idea what was going on and stepped off to see what was going on and was walking to the bottom floor and ran into one of the cops and ended up having to explain what was going on, at the moment I was really embarrassed, but now I can look back and laugh.

In 7th grade, my friend "Barbara" was asked out by this girl, but my friend Barbara wasn't a lesbian. But since she is a nice person and she didn't want the girl to feel bad, so she said yes. Now they are together in a relationship that really isn't supposed to be I guess.

 I was yesterday and will be today. The most peaceful souls float in the air. My father, left my mother and me when I was seven. I don't remember my father's face, or his hands, nothing at all. My mother and I never talked about it.  I walked into nothing today. It was nice. Quietly.  The sun was warming the earth. A moment of truth, and I remembered that it was only February and the sun was so strong.  "It's too warm," I said softly to myself as if I was afraid someone would hear me in the void of the street. People will go all the way.  They are like that. I can yell as much as I want, but they will go all the way, we can all go to town full of people, far from this small village and yell, but they will go all the way, I can look for my father and yell for him, but he will go further where he has to. Where everyone has to. All to ruin.

No one could�ve offered a rational explanation at first. It was baffling why millions of upstanding citizens committed a series of violent crimes over the course of a single night. All across the nation and world, there was an extreme spike in mindless violence. Police departments were so focused on the horrific crime sprees in their own precincts that they failed to recognize it wasn�t an isolated phenomenon. Only later did they recognize there was some sort of deadly connection across the globe.The CDC scrambled to analyze the massive amount of data coming in. For a crime wave to be global, it pointed to an atmospheric cause but all of the collected air samples failed to reveal any obvious source of an issue. The team assigned to the case worked directly with the World Health Organization and every other recognized contagious disease group. In short order it was the greatest assembly of scientific minds in the world, working on a mutually imperative goal. That�s not to say it was an open and closed case, by any stretch. Besides the rash of mindless crimes being an incredible challenge to solve, it was also mired down by the massive egos associated with those brilliant scientific minds. When you have dozens of academic �superstars�, they have a difficult time working together as a collaborative team. The unexplained crimes continued. The global brain trust sequestered themselves in protective bunkers to avoid being compromised. In the outside world, everything was falling apart. Emergency personnel responding to fires, stabbings, or gunshot wounds were often seized by the very same violent madness as the victims and perpetrators. Pilots deliberately crashing their planes. Bus drivers wrecked their vehicles. Suicidal drivers went the wrong way on interstates and large highways. By the best estimates, over two billion people were dead or mortally wounded by the mass insanity. Hundreds of millions of others were in dire need of food or medicine but were unwilling to leave the relative safety of their homes.Many days passed with little or no progress being made. The number of dead or fatally wounded was reassessed at five billion. Between the interagency fighting and the institutional gridlock within each contagious disease organization, hope was bleak. Finally a scientist stepped forward to seize control of the research project before all was lost. He reminded the impressive collection of researchers that if they didn�t quickly learn to work together, there would be no one left to brag to. Of course they all realized how serious it was, but hearing it spelled out in those practical terms was sobering in a way which finally resonated with them. For his part in rallying the disorganized troops, he was unanimously voted to be the lead investigator. The first thing he did was to poll every team over what they knew for certain, and also what they theorized was going on. Once that information was shared freely with all of the research agencies, it made for a much more efficient effort. Society and civilization had long since broken down and crumbled. Death estimates topped 6.5 Billion. Autopsies conducted on the brains of the dead revealed a rather curious swelling of specific reasoning areas. An analysis of chemicals found in their bodies of the victims revealed just one unusual item; high levels of the rare earth element Iridium. At that stage, the swollen brains of the dead and the odd discovery of the rare element was just circumstantial evidence at best; but it was the strongest lead so far. The amount of iridium on asteroids and meteorites in space is often infinitely higher than on the Earth, with one notable exception. That being in the Gulf of Mexico where a large asteroid impacted 63 million years ago (and lead to the eventual extinction of most of the dinosaurs; according to certain theories). The braintrust put all of their resources into researching a possible link between those two very odd things. It was their �Hail Mary� play during the 11th hour of mankind�s tenuous existence. Once they focused on that specific course of research, it was noted that the earliest known examples of the mass insanity syndrome was connected to the same geographic area! Amazingly, it seemed to all start on the fringes of the gulf and radiate outwardly, like a deadly nuclear strike. It was the strongest link yet between the swollen brains of the dead and rare iridium in their systems. Then the CDC searched for evidence of how or why iridium could�ve been spread worldwide. About two weeks before the devastating outbreak, an oil company drilling in the Gulf of Mexico had struck a large layer of tough sediment. Their solution was to drill through it and then blow it high into the atmosphere. That was the simplest means of driving past it to reach the rich oil layer, without polluting the ocean and being fined by the EPA. Once it was shot up into the stratosphere, it then circulated globally on high altitude winds. The rest was history. The first thing the combined research forces did was to organize a last-ditch mission to shut down the automated oil rig responsible for wiping out over seven billion people. It was still belching out hundreds of tons of the toxic element every day, long after every unprotected human being for hundreds of miles was dead. Once the root source of the catastrophe was eliminated, the Earth could slowly begin to heal. Eventually the toxic iridium in the atmosphere fell back to the surface and was swept away into the global waterways. Over time, the levels dropped until they were safe for the shallow remains of humanity. From there, we could begin anew.

So my name is Daniel and i�m 16 years old. I�m a part of this crazy discord me and a bunch of my buddies are in that�s turned in to this really cool like international hub. People from all over the world are on this server and it�s truly amazing and impressive how we all interact and have fun. See most people from other places came from this other discord server called Shrine of Jonesy dedicated to fortnite, and we garnered a majority of the 100+ members through there. One such man was this 19 year old named Robert. Robert seemed normal at first but we quickly realized his Fortnite love was more than just an enjoyment. Robert absolutely wants to have sex with fortnite characters. He consistently talks about his obsession with the characters and how aroused they make him, and he brings this to every conversation. While tolerable to talk to it gets extremely overwhelming constantly hearing about how much he wants to have sex with the calamity skin. We�ve all taken part in it in a sense and began to just poke fun at him and embrace it almost, but recently i�ve felt almost bad. See most of the discord is moderately rude to him, telling him to shut the fuck up even when he�s not talking about banging fortnite characters, and he deals with this constant barrage from kids day in and day out. I may just be a kid and i�ve definitely participated in some of the onslaught but i wonder if he hurts from it sometimes. Sometimes i wonder if maybe the guy does it all as a joke, in an effort to have us laugh and make it fun. I ponder if perhaps Robert really isn�t as weird as it seems, maybe he�s just some normal guy fucking around on the internet, much like whoever�s probably reading this. This man we call Robert, however strange he may be, and as mysterious as he is, I very well believe could just be a normal 19 year old looking to make others happy and taking a beating in order to do so, putting his own emotions on the line in order to bring others joy.

  You�ve believed that silly story your entire life... Sir Isaac Newton discovered gravity (or at least wrote the conjecture thereof) when an apple fell off an apple tree and conked his not-so-empty skull. What a cute way to learn about gravity... if you�re a FIRST GRADER. It�s time to grow the hell up and accept the truth about this story. Perhaps not all parts are appropriate for a first grader, but now assuming that you�ve matured at least a little bit since then, you should be ready.It all started with LSD; yes, the drug. I bet you didn�t know that Isaac Newton himself actually discovered LSD. Indeed, he himself discovered it and its lucid effects, and named it for the effects that it had on the brain. Its abbreviation stands for �Lucid Scientific Discovery� and Newton named it such because of the way it made reality feel more like a controlled (lucid) dream. At the peak of Newton�s career, he had many projects going on, and, of course, they all produced data. He collected heaps and heaps of data that he recorded on paper fragments, which he struggled to keep organized at times. One day, he was conducting some chemical research for a new artificial sweetener that he was working on. You are probably familiar with the controversial sweetener called Aspartame. That�s right, Isaac Newton invented aspartame, but they�ll never tell you that in the history books, because the FDA doesn�t want you to know just how *close* Aspartame is to the powerful drug we call LSD. On this particular day, some of Newton�s unorganized data got into the mix. It turned out that a sheet from his tentative recipe for battery acid had slithered its way into the mix, and that was all it took. LSD had been born. You may want to take note that this is why LSD is commonly called �acid�. It all makes sense now, doesn�t it?The ensuing taste test sent Newton on a trip that would coincidentally give him the best idea he had ever had on how to keep from mixing up his data again.Newton was fond of nature. It inspired him, it made him think. It kept him company without the distractions that human company can bring along with it. When it came to deciding between nature and people for good company, he would choose Mother Nature over his own mother any day. In fact, he hated his mother. She was rather� oh, never mind, we aren�t here to talk about his personal life. Let�s regain focus. On a certain brisk, early-Summer day in 1694, Sir Isaac Newton needed a break from his research. He wanted some alone time, but he didn�t want to feel alone, so he did what he would always do when he felt this way. He paid a visit to his grandmother�s apple tree. She had passed almost ten years ago now, but he felt as though she were still there because of all the memories they held at this tree. Before making the trip to the tree, he remembered that he hadn�t yet tried his newest rendition of Aspartame after it had cured and decided to bring some of the powder along to share with his grandma. That way, it was almost as if he were working while he was relaxing.Newton meandered along the path from his home until he reached the grove atop the hill only a few hundred meters away. There was the tree, bent and dark, with thick bark that seemed to collect in certain crevices like wrinkles on an elderly woman�s face. The trees in the surrounding area cleared in such a fashion that the sun could shine underneath the tree in the cool of the morning, providing the necessary ingredients for a lush bed of grass to thrive beneath the old, irregular branches. Newton sat in the grass, propping himself up against the wise-looking, aged trunk. He didn�t know it, but he was about to do some LSD with grandma.He pulled out an apple he had picked from one of the younger trees on his way up the path and figured that it would be a great treat to pair with a never-before-tasted artificial sweetener. He sprinkled a touch of the fine, white powder from his leather pouch onto the apple. He bit deep, and almost immediately saw colors he had never seen before. At first, he was horrified by the unexpected change of scenery, but then he couldn�t help but just admire its beauty.A giant swirl of the brightest colors he had ever seen flickered in the sky and then seemed to slow to a soft blink as it descended upon the scenery around him. He stood and watched as it caressed the trees before seemingly possessing them and giving them new life in the form of swirling color. He couldn�t get enough of the beauty, but in the back of his mind, he couldn�t help but think about it. He needed to organize his data better. But how?As quickly as he became used to the scene, the scene shifted. All the color suddenly sank to the ground and gently exploded into a mist that hugged the ground as it floated by. Everything else became dark except for his grandmother�s tree. He stared at it, admiring the way the mist enveloped the base of its trunk. Some of the cloud of mist crept up the tree and began to shine like a silver lining around the tree. Just as the tree became fully outlined, his grandmother stepped out from behind the tree, calmly. She looked as though she had never been gone and was paying Newton a regular visit. She stepped toward him and kissed his forehead before handing him a black box. The black box was small, compact, and devoid of any color, but somehow it drew him in more than anything else around him.He looked up to ask his grandmother what this was and what was happening, but with a bright flash, everything around him disappeared. He stood in a pure white room that had no sense of depth and seemed to never end. There he stood, with the void, black box in his hands. He knew he had to see what was inside. He broke open the box and took note of everything that he could on a notepad that he kept in his vest pocket. He wrote and wrote, failing to notice the scenery around him starting to fade back into normalcy. Just as he was about to finish his writing, the fading scene suddenly collapsed back into darkness. The box was gone, and so was the sun. It was evening.Newton never fully understood the device that he took notes on that day. In reviewing his notes, he found that one crucial piece of data was missing. He understood that the box used sparks of some sort to collect, store, and organize data, but he was unsure of how to route the channels of sparks in such a small fashion. He was on the brink of inventing the battery using the acid that had been unintentionally added to his Aspartame, but he was unsure of how to fully control it as of yet.Fast forward to the 1940�s, when computers were finally invented. With the advances made in technology, the industrialized views of electricity, and the discovery of Silicon, scientists were finally able to decrypt Newton�s notepad. The plans had been there all along, but the necessary tools had only just been discovered, so now, the computer could be born. The location of Newton�s notepad is now unknown, but many believe it to be buried with the legend, Steve Jobs, who was one of the first people able to condense Newton�s notes into a device the size of the one Newton originally held in his tripped-out hands. That�s why Mr. Jobs named his company Apple Computers. He knew the entire time that the concept for computers was originally jotted underneath an Apple tree by a man who accidentally discovered not gravity, but LSD.In conclusion, I hope you have learned three things. First, Aspartame is basically LSD minus the acid. Second, never trust the FDA. Third, many secrets may lie in the grave of the man who founded Apple Computers.Stay woke, readers.

The best time to plant a tree was 20 year's ago, the next best time is to plant it today. As cliche as this might sound, it is getting worse as we move forward. Flash floods are so common now that we take it for granted and think that we won't face anything worse than this.But the truth is still a mystery. Things might turn good and balance might just return to our planet, but we are doing it wrong.We are looking for solutions, not preventions. One might argue that it's not possible to predict the actions of nature. But we can, we have the technology to predict all sorts of natural activity, but do we look into how this could be avoided.Global warming as it's popularly termed causes effects not just near the most polluted places. This is the reason the balance in our ecosystem is shifting year by year, minute by minute and day by day.The day will eventually come when we will strive to escape this planet. The day we call Moon, Mars a better place to live in, is the day we failed as a species.No doubt it's an achievement to live in these extraterrestrial bodies, but was it worth destroying the home planet. It's just an escape plan, nothing more.We will eventually be the centre of this burden, we can either make it better. Its a collective achievement of individual effort.Humans have won wars together, have made beautiful inventions together, why can't we take a small effort by reducing wastage of electricity, water and of course garbage(plastics). This will go a long way if you see it as a collective achievement.The day the tickets to Mars and moon will be auctioned in millions, will be the day I completely lose hope in humanity, because it's going to happen. On the day when this planet will be termed inhabitable for humans.We will try to move to cleaner energy. Try to extract energy from magma. We will see more Chernobyl and Fukushima which affects every living organisms near it.We talked about humans, what about the rest of the animal and plant kingdom, don't they deserve to go escape with us, are we going to abandoned monkeys to carry more chicken, only time will tell.Most species will be severely endangered. We will be one of them.The damage is coming, we must be ready to embrace it.

So it was 2 years ago and summer time I live in the UK and near my house there is a large meadow which is sometimes home to cows and calf's.So one day took the dog for a walk as there is a pub on other side of the field. Anyway on the way there everything was fine cows were on other side of the field but...... On the way back they had moved and needed to walk through them to get to the gate all was fine till my dog started going mad and barking at the calf's which then attracted the cows who then proceeded to encircle us and start mooing. I have to say at this stage I thought I was going to die being surrounded by 30+ cows is not great anyway in the end the dog shut up and a man came along with a big stick and they scattered. So now I shall never bring my dog near cows again..

 This Short Story which i [read here](http://arbtech.co.in/Social/A-Complete-Guide-on-How-to-Start-a-Relationship-and-maintain-Happy-Relationship-with-your-loved-one/23) gives a very clear view on relationship and  worth sharing.....The old man, was on one of his rare visits to his daughter and son-in-law.This� was needed to comfort the old man from loneliness� after his wife�s demise seven months ago.After  dinner that evening, he whispered to his son-in-law that if  they  didn�t mind, he would love to have a quick word with the couple  after  the children had gone to bed.By 9pm, the couple was back in the living room to hear what the old man had to say.He    started by asking them a simple question.�What is the most important    thing in your life dear?�She replied, �Daddy, it is the kids !!! They    mean everything to me�..�He  then   turned and asked his son-in-law the same question, he also  (beaming  with  pride) said :"it is the kids of course; they are the  reason why I  work  so hard to ensure they have a better life�"Well     said my children. I don�t mean to intrude on how to run your  family     life, but I believe there is a fundamental error you will need to      correct. He said � I have observed how much you both love your kids  and     dedicate all your time for them......I have observed that almost all your conversation borders mostly on the kids." The couple nodded� in admission to the assertion.He     continued, "I am a poultry farmer, and the biggest egg supplier in    my   district. I make my money by the quantity of eggs sold. That said,    my   priority has always been providing optimal care for the chicken.      Because, I know that when the chicken are healthy and productive,  the     eggs will automatically be bountiful.�\*If I start to ignore the   chicken,  the eggs will also suffer\*."He     pointed to his son-in-law and said, �as a husband, the most    important   person in your life should be your wife and vice versa.�It   cannot be the  kids. They are just products of the marriage.\*If     you learn to take care of each other very well, your kids will  grow    up  healthy, happy and well-adjusted, but if you ignore each other,     brace  yourself up for dysfunctional kids in the future\*.�The     two of you are the foundation of this family. If you suffer any     crack,  the whole house will go down. So please make time for yourself     and  treat each other as \*PRIORITY\* and the kids will be just fine.This has been the secret of the fruitful union between your Mother and Myself for over 50 years till death took her from me.The old man's eyes welled up with tears at this stage.�He thanked the couple for their time and excused himself to his room.If     care is not taken, this magical connection� gets weakened, thereby      opening up a marriage to all sorts of strange elements and even      divorce.Let� kids observe that     your spouse means the world to you and if you  are to choose between     them and your spouse, it will always be your  spouse.Give the kids the love and attention they deserve but not at the cost of neglecting each other.

There are so many thoughts in my head. Nothing will shut up. I'm taking deep breaths and yet I can barely breath. All I can feel is a sense of defeat, finality, and that no matter what I do I'm damned either way. My body feels weak and I'm losing every bit of will I have to keep going. And yet on the outside I'm going about my day like nothing is wrong. Of all my thoughts only one thing cones to the forefront: why am I still trying? I can stop this right now. But then another part of me speaks up and says: "because if you stop everything falls apart. And it'll be all your fault". So I keep going. I wonder where I went wrong. I've done everything that has been asked of me and still it's not enough. When will it release it's grip? Will it ever let me go? Am I a slave to it? Or I am I as free as any other man and I'm only trapped in my head?  I don't know. So I keep going like nothing is wrong, and wait for the grip to loosen just a little bit. And enjoy the seconds I have to breathe again. Before the grip takes me again.

Hello! My name is Kasper and i am 11 years old and i have a story. I am sorry if my english is not the best i am from Denmark.&#x200B;So i can't Remember all of this becuase i was really young! But here is what i have heard and can remember.I was a normal kid in the thing before preshool in danish it is "Vuggestue" but then when i came in Preschool it changed.Let me say my mom put me in that Preschool becuase it was close to the school that my brother was in. So it was easy to get me to preschool and then put my brother to school.But the bully kicked me, pushed me, and punched me alot! I think that one of the only reasons that he would do this is becuase he was abused i think i am not 100% sure but he could take a stick and put up in my butt.. He would push me of like a little tower that is like 2-3 meters high in feets  6.5- 9.8 feets. He was stoopid i thought but like he would do that in 6 months. He would take my toys and throw them at a road that is close to the Preschool. Then he would hold me so i could  not pee or make poop so i would pee in my pants. My skin would get weird as my mom says. He would JUMP on my D\*ck! I was insecure at so young age! But i remember when my mom and grandma came and said to me "This is the last time you see this place" and then we got a icecream and such. I got in a new Preschool but i was very aggresive in some time. But i had knew some of the kids there so i got some friends :) I am failing alot at typing this becuase the flashbacks i get. To the wild suprise (Sarcasm)  i was really depressed and had suicide thoughts but i only have then like once a month.&#x200B;I wrote this becuase i had watched rSlash and Karma Comment Chameleon and some more...Thank you for reading i really hope a youtuber or anyone would read this!Edit: i use my dad's account!

So a comment I posted of my moms strange behavior blew up and people enjoyed it. So I thought I'd start a series of strange things my mom did while I was growing up and also some recent things. This story probably isnt the best one but this is when I noticed as early as I could remember that my mom wasnt... like other parents.I was 6-7? It was the year the horror movie "scream" came out and my mom and her friend took my sister and I to the drive in theater and she made us fall asleep in the back of the truck because she didnt want us to watch the scary movie (probably shouldve left us home with grandpa) anyways. I hear the screams of terror in the movie and it peaked my interest but never saw the movie. Until a year later when the movie came out on VHS! My mom bought the movie of course. I begged her to let me watch it and with very little effort she let me watch the movie.Now if you're familiar with this horror movie you obviously know the first 10 minutes of the movie is the bloodiest and most disturbing and the rest of the movie is pretty tame lmao. So we start watching the movie and we get all the way to the part where drew Barrymore is talking about how she has a boyfriend and is going to kick ghost faces ass. Omg I'm cracking up just writing this part. When drew gets the question wrong and turns on the porch light she sees that the boyfriend's stomach is torn open and his insides are pouring out. Needless to say I flipped the fuck out, I started crying and frantically running in circles lmao. My mom tried her best to be a good mom and overall I think she is. But she told me she wanted to turn the movie off as to not scare me. Damage was done. So I collected myself and told her I wouldnt get scared anymore and I really wanted to finish the movie. The rest of the movie was a fucking cake walk. Cut to age 25 and I'm literally un phased by any horror movie. I watch horror movies all the time. I watch fucked up stuff on the internet, unphased. I'm so desensitized by disturbing stuff that that in and of itself is disturbing. And that is part one of "tales of my mom"

In order to avoid the Vietnam war, my grandfather joined the national guard. He was able to get in because they didn�t have many guys that could do electrical work, and he was an electrician. Now, he told me a couple of stories. He first one was about inspection days. In his company, higher ranking officers would inspect the barracks and if you were in the best one, you got a 3-day weekend. Now, my grandpa�s barrack was a mess. Broken mirrors in the latrine (bathroom), a scratched up door, everything. The kicker is they don�t provide stuff to fix these things. Now, someone in the barracks said to my grandfather �hey, (grandfather�s name), you have that screw gun (drill) for electric stuff, yeah? Whadya say we borrow some stuff from other barracks?� My grandfather knew what he meant immediately. They waited until it was late at night, and started their heist. They went to the cabin that had won for the past few inspections, and swapped not only the mirrors in the latrine, but the damn door as well. Next morning, the company is all lined up, and you can here people saying �who broke the mirrors?� �What happened to the door?� So, inspection is finished and it�s announced that barrack C (my grandfather�s) was the cleanest. He did this several times after this. There are more stories he told me if you all want them.

As a kid, I was a little shy and very nice, think stereotypical sweet little girl that was well liked. Because of this, I didn't really need to stand up for myself or others, since bullying wasn't as bad at my elementary and middle schools, and it was *mostly* just teasing. If I was ever picked on, I couldn't really tell. In 7th grade (13yo) I was in FACS (Home Ec basically). Before class started, my teacher was in the hall talking to the art teacher. One kid was playing a game on his laptop, and several of the kids were standing around him, making fun of him. Little me stood up and told them to leave him alone. This bitch Monie started berating me. I've known this bitch since kindergarten, and her personality has never changed. I ended up sitting down and taking it, with the whole class watching. She kept repeating shit along the lines of I've had the same haircut all my life, and other dumb insults. The whole time, I'm just sitting there saying stuff like, "Oh, I'm so hurt, how could you say that," in the most sarcastic and condescending tone I could. That got her to shut up a lot quicker than making up dumb insults would, and the class ended up laughing when she got flustered.I'm so proud of little baby me. I stood up for someone I didn't really know, got insulted but defended myself in front of the whole class, making a fool of a known bitch. I mean this was only two years ago but I've grown a lot since then, I'm basically a new person.

So last week was an absolute disaster. Monday I was almost late to my new job as a union electrician which meant I would have looked bad to my crew but also would have lost my incentive. Tuesday I got food poisoning from a food truck that comes out here and stayed because I needed the money and couldn�t afford to be sick. Wednesday I stopped at a BP on my way to work and got half the gas I payed for because the guy had rigged pumps. Thursday I blew out my transmission and until Saturday I had to use the same dirty work clothes to keep coming into work. So then this week starts. I had to return a car I was renting which cost me $342 for 1 day! But it was my fault for allowing myself to be scammed. The next day (Tuesday) I had to get to work late because I needed to rent another car (this time way cheaper) I�ve been eating what chips and fruit cups I�ve had in my pantry for lunch and breaks to try and curb any spending until I could get to a lot tomorrow or Saturday. Yesterday was payday which was a happy yet fleeting moment as that money also has to go towards the down payment of my car. Then today out of the blue while waiting and car shopping while the outside crew gets set up for us to start our work my foreman came to me with a small wad of money and said �this is from your brothers� it�s not much $166 to be exact but I have never been so touched in my life. Through this hellish week and few days I kept my chin up trying to stay positive and keep a smile on my face and for the first time I�m having to hide in a power box to keep from letting my emotions get the better of me. These guys don�t know me nor did they owe me a single dime. But they banded together to scrap up what they could to help me get at least a little more for a down payment towards a new car. I hope y�all have just as good a day as I am right now. Now if you�ll excuse me I�ve got to mop up this floor of tears in this box I�m in.

I knew David in fourth grade, he rode a red coaster-brake bike with no fenders. He always kept his hair cut short in a buzz-cut and overall didn�t stand out from my other ten-year-old friends at the time.The stabbing incident in fourth grade was prophetic, I think. It *was* an accident, but it hurt a lot and I still have the scar. In our classroom he had tapped too hard on the fish tank and it fractured, spilling gallons of water and a half dozen goldfish -- they were left flopping all over the classroom floor. Mrs. Cope didn�t get mad. She calmly scooped up the fish to rescue them and then ordered us to move our desks from the puddle while she stepped out to call the janitor. David was holding a pair of grown-up scissors while pushing his desk. As I stepped past, the back of my hand found the point, a simple accident.  So when the teacher returned with janitor in tow to clean up the water, there was blood to deal with as well since I had been stabbed in the hand. She walked me to nurse�s office and a butterfly closure patched me up.The next time I saw David, I was 19. I had been tasked with driving my father�s Buick to the local shop for an oil change, and there was David, still the same short haircut, working at the oil change shop. As he handed me the clipboard, he recognized me.�How are things going with you?� he asked.�Fine, I�m going to college in the fall,� I said, �and you?��Not so good,� he said, "I got arrested for armed robbery and have been sentenced to five years in prison.�  I had no good response for that.Apparently he told his roommate he was planning to rob the local Dairy Queen with a gun. His roommate threatened to call the cops, so they would be waiting for him. The roommate did call the cops, and they *were* waiting for him. So David stepped up to the cashier in the restaurant and drew his gun. The police swarmed in arrested him, thus ending the world�s shortest criminal career.

In 2015, when I was 15 years old, I was really good friends with a girl who, for the purpose of this story we�ll call J. J and I would always go and ride our bikes around local parks and just do all kinds of goofy and weird shit (like going into storm drain tunnels, pretending to be Jehovah�s Witnesses, just crazy shit, we were goofy and crazy ass kids). One day we were riding our bikes at a park up the street from our neighborhood and we saw these emo kids sitting in a circle. There were ~10 of them and they all had dyed hair and tons of makeup on. All of a sudden, they all started making out. Naturally, my friend and I were like �what the fuck� and so we decided to get a closer look. When we approached the area where the emo kids were making out, we realized that they were playing spin-the-bottle. A lightbulb went off in my head and I told J �Hey J, let�s go kick their bottle and yell �NOT IN MY CLEAN CATHOLIC SCHOOL!!!�� and, J, being the person that she was, thought that this would be a great idea. So we counted to three and then we ran up as fast as we could, kicked their bottle, and yelled �NOT IN MY CLEAN CATHOLIC SCHOOL!!!�The emo  kids started spazzing out, some of them were yelling �WHAT THE FUCK???� and others were trying to fight us. Seeing the situation escalating as it was, I decided to get some Jehovah�s Witnesses pamphlets that we had taken from a coffee shop (we used the pamphlets for all kinds of stuff) from the basket on my bike and give them to the emo kids. I handed all of the Emo kids a Jehovah�s Witness pamphlet and said �we are with the Jehovah�s Witnesses and we want all of you to find the great and almighty JC, praise him.� To make the situation funnier, I was wearing a Led Zeppelin shirt and one of the emo kids yelled �BULLSHIT, YOU HAVE A FUCKING ZEP SHIRT ON, YOU AREN�T A JW, DUMBASS.� We jokingly argued with the emo kids for like an hour or so and then we all started laughing and just talking about our favorite games/bands together and shit. After this, J and I rode our bikes to our houses. We came back to the same park a week later and saw the same emo kids in a circle playing spin-the-bottle again. This time we just walked up and said �Hey strangers� and we all laughed about the whole situation for like 5 minutes.

Okay, so we all know the Moto Moto meme from Madagascar 2 that died a little bit ago, right?  Well it single handedly made my first kiss one of the most awkward moments of my life...  For background information, I am a Junior in high school, and I was in a secret relationship with one of my best friend's girlfriend.  That was a big mistake in itself, but then she left me, stayed with him, and on top of that, won't talk to me which is even worse.  She was a cute, small blonde haired girl with a killer body, she was everything I could ask for in a girl so I fell right in when given the chance.  Looking back I should have realized that it wouldn't end well, it seemed too good to be true, and as we all know: if it seems too good to be true, it is.  Anyway, I had her over so we could screw around a bit while my parents were away, neither of us had our licenses so we told her dad it was for a group school project and that the others were running behind.  I made her a big meal that we had together and then we made our way to the couch to cuddle and play with my dogs (she loved my dogs).  I was trying to get close to her but my dogs kept fighting so I had to wait until they stopped, that in itself almost ruined it.  They finally stopped and I turned on the TV for background noise while we cuddled.  I don't know why but Madagascar 2 was on and she specifically says "Oh god, I absolutely hate the Moto Moto scene in this, the song makes me so uncomfortable", this was at the peak of Moto Moto memes as well.  Neither of us thought to change it though.  Eventually we got a bit more touchy on each other and she gave me the look before getting on top of me and beginning to make out with me, I hadn't kissed anyone before so it was quite the experience to have it be as passionate as it was (not sure if that's the right word, I am not sure how to describe it).  We were like that for a few minutes, consistently kissing and her on top grinding on me.  Then... the fateful moment comes... we hear from the TV, "Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you"... I am not exaggerating when I say she stopped kissing me, hopped off and just sat there.  I was thoroughly embarrassed as you could imagine, I looked for the remote but couldn't find it.  I was genuinely upset even though I didn't show it, I thought it was done after that because it killed the mood, luckily not.  We got back into it a couple minutes after and continued for the rest of the duration of the movie.  Still, yikes.That night she told me that she loved me, we had been 'together' for about a month and a half, and honestly, as well as we worked and as happy as we seemed to be together, I didn't hesitate saying it back.  She left me a couple days later, we ended up trying again a few days after that but it didn't last more than 2 weeks.  I'm still trying to figure out if that's a shame or not, we seemed to be perfect for each other, but that doesn't matter now, I won't allow myself to take her back even if I want to.I felt the need to tell my friend a few days ago about the stuff she and I exchanged.  I also told him that I had her over with the intent on having sex (this was something she proposed and we planned to do for some time, I wasn't just coming up with plans in my head).  I am honestly pretty disturbed by the fact that he kind of just said "that's fine" and stayed with her and acts like it never happened... I am pretty sure that makes him a cuck actually.Thanks for reading.  This is my first post on reddit ever.  If this is well received I may tell the story between her and I, because oh boy is it a story, comment if you'd like to hear that.

Disclaimer: I am reposting this story from r/sex because I just feel like more people need to read it since I will never share this story in person.&#x200B; My  wife is not quite as forward about sex as I am, and as a result it took  us a while to get to the point where we started incorporating toys in  the bedroom. We don't have an extensive collection by any means, but I  have managed to coax a few things that she likes out of her. Sometimes  we ask each other questions about fantasies or things we would like to  bring into the bedroom, but other times I just find little things like a  bullet or vibrating ring and surprise her with them. A few days ago I  decided to get her a new toy as a mock Valentine's Day gift. We don't  usually buy each other anything for Valentine's Day but we needed some  toy cleaner and I was on Adam & Eve, so I thought I'd take advantage  of those ads I'd been hearing on Pandora.I  poked around the site looking for something that would be slightly  silly to convey the mock-ness of the gift, but still be something I  could see us using since I didn't want it to be a complete waste of  money. I landed on the "Clone-a-Willy" dildo kit because what could be  better than to give her my package for Valentine's? It was available in  an array of colors like a slightly uncanny valley flesh tone, jet black,  neon purple, and glow in the dark (who doesn't like to turn out the  lights and play peek-a-boo with their vibrator?). They even had a Plus  version that includes your balls in the mold, but it was an extra $35  and I wasn't that committed to this. I decided on purple, as it kept up  the, previously, unintentional trend of colors that was running in our  toy box already.The items arrived on  the 13th and when I read the instructions it was clear that the dildo  itself was not going to be ready in time, it takes almost 34 hours from  start to finish. I decided, instead, to make a lovely presentation of  the kit itself for her to find after we got out of the shower. When she  turned down the sheets on her side of the bed, the gift waiting for her  was met with raucous laughter and a few questions as to the level of my  sanity. I suggested to her that this could be a stepping stone to  bringing arts and crafts into the bedroom, but as the laughter and sheer  befuddlement continued I started to realize this was one craft she was  not intending on helping me with. I would have to wait until she was at  work and handle this myself to save her from dying of laughter and  embarrassment for me.That Saturday, I  took it upon myself to get her new toy all setup while she was at work,  still blissfully naive as to how awkward it was going to get. The kit  consists of an alginate powder for the mold and a two-part silicone for  the casting, there's also a vibrator to insert in the cast and a few  tools to help stir and prepare. This is all packaged up in a nice tube  that becomes the jacket for the mold, so the first step is to measure  and cut to size the tube. It has to be a half inch longer than your full  erection, and yes there's plenty of tube for 99% of the population. The  next step is rather time sensitive because alginate, at least the  specific blend they use, cures very quickly. According to the  instructions, I had 45 seconds to mix the alginate and pour it in the  tube, followed by about 1 minute to position myself before it became to  thick to adjust. I had no trouble getting an erection for the measuring  portion, but that mast had faded while I was mentally preparing myself  for the imminent mess I was about to make in my bathroom. I was having  trouble rising to the occasion, but stepped up to bat because this was,  after all, a gift for my wife. Since I was quite certain this arousal  would not last, I heeded the instructions' advice and put on a ring  before mixing up the delightful concoction. I stepped into the shower  because I knew this was going to spill everywhere and then thrust myself  as deep as possible into what I could only describe as lukewarm cream  of wheat (Jason Biggs, eat your heart out). I set a timer on my phone,  even though I could tell easily that it was cured... fun fact, it's an  exothermic reaction. De-molding turned out to be a bit trickier, even,  than I had anticipated because the alginate uses water to start a  chemical reaction and it is indiscriminate as to where the water comes  from; it also makes quite a vacuum seal, especially around the head of a  penis or the edges of a ring. When I managed to unsheathe myself from  the tube I was left with the rather unpleasant task of removing a  silicone ring from my very warmed and bone dry skin, this proved to be  the most uncomfortable part of the whole process.Of  course, I couldn't just go straight into the silicone pour,  the  instructions say for the best detail you have to wait 8-10 hours to let  some of the excess moisture escape the mold; so I set the weirdest  looking bud vase on my desk and went about the rest of my day. I came  back to it that evening and decided I would do well to figure out where  to position the vibrator before I got into pouring the silicone (after  all, I only had 24 hours for it to set up). I am longer than the  vibrator, but I'm also a bit more curved which meant that it was a tight  fit to go right down the middle. I decided to pull it back a little and  leave more of it hanging out the back than the requisite battery  cover/switch. Details worked out, I mixed the two part silicone and  poured it into my, impressive in the right light, mold as it starts to  dawn on me the level of ridiculousness in this product. Said  ridiculousness solidified around the same time that the silicone did and  I removed it from the mold, like the world's grossest popsicle. When  the instructions said for best details, they weren't kidding; I was now  staring at a bright purple copy of my phallus complete with every  wrinkle on the head, and every bulging vein down the shaft. I'm no  stranger to handling myself, it's how I spent a large portion of my life  since discovering it, but there was something different about seeing it  represented in three dimensions and removed from my body. It's like  hearing your own voice on a recording, and I was not so impressed.

I swear it was like it came straight out of a movie. It was about 4 years ago, my first day of English class sophomore year of high school. I was sitting 3 seats behind a new boy in my class, heavily taking notes. The following is what he later relayed to me:He was sitting in class, looked back towards the clock, and saw me. He thought to himself, �I need to talk to her!� So for the remainder of the class period, unbeknownst to me, he preceded to pretend to drop his pencil and pick it up or pretend to be looking at the time so he could look at me again. He must have done it about 20 times he said, but I, who was buried in my notebook, didn�t notice.He sat there all period thinking of ways he could somehow approach me and ask for my number. Being the really shy guy he is, that was extremely nerve wracking for him. Then, in a glimpse of chance, our English teacher said we were going to be doing a project and had to work with the people in our row. He thought, �This is it!!� I, the devoted student, however, just thought �There�s a new boy sitting up there, I wonder if he will pull his weight or if I will have to do it�.As I preceded to stand up and tell my group members how I, miss young and driven, will do all the work and that they would only be allowed to edit it, I glanced down and saw the most wonderful thing I have ever seen in my life. It was his face, smiling up at me. My first thought was �Wow, he�s beautiful�. I had seen boys before, but I had never, ever, seen any boy that looked as gorgeous as he did that Tuesday. I did not allow my rapid heart beat to derail my focus for long, of course, and preceded to tell them to let me do all the work. We all exchanged numbers (to his delight) and went on our way.That night, I was texting in the group chat asking if anyone had any preferences for our PowerPoint format. Immediately, he messaged me outside the group chat with his answer. I thought, �He must not be able to text in a group chat or something� and directed my thoughts back to work. The next morning, he responded to me individually again! I thought, �He seems really nice, I�ll ask him where he�s from. He must not have many friends having just moved here and all.� And then we started texting back and forth.Around 10 text messages was all it took. I knew after that that he was the one for me, that he was different than any other boy in the entire world. He was charming, sweet, goofy, and really intelligent. He was everything I had ever wanted, but I didn�t even know I wanted until then. I honestly had never felt that way before, and all it took was a few text messages.Fast forward 4 years and we both attend different colleges, but are as in love as ever. Right after we graduate, I plan to marry him and start our lives together.

I used to be a cocktail waitress at a local strip club. One night when I was working there was a man who was standing in the middle of the floor, dancing to the club music by himself. He was only purchasing bottled water from the bar. Eventually, a stripper walked by, and noticed him dancing. She danced with him for the remainder of the song. After the song was over she told him that she had to go back to work. He asked her to stay and continue dancing with him. (Clothes on vanilla dancing and the no touching rule still applied). She told him that she could but she was there to work, so she would charge each dance (song) to his tab. He must not have heard her because he was stone sober, only purchasing one bottle of water from the bar and just went with the flow, vanilla dancing with this stripper all the way to bar close. The guy racked up a a tab that was over $1500. In complete shock and bafflement, he refused to pay. By the time he FINALLY signed his receipt from the astronomical transaction, he was surrounded by management and all of the bouncers, and my shift had already ended and had clocked out. I never asked the dancer, but I think it's safe to say he never tipped her, and that he never returned after that night.

Last year in August my family decided to visit Saint Tropez. It was just my dad, my bigger sister and I.   My dad's age was 59, my sister's 32 and mine was 20. Here in Europe the legal drinking age is 18, so I was allowed to do so. We visited the beaches and relaxed but on our last night we decided to visit the famous VIP Room club. I should also mention that we are upper middle class and didn't know when we would get an occasion like that anytime soon. And so we got dressed and went to the club. The bouncer was the tallest, most muscular man I have ever seen in my life. He looked at me and just said "No."   I told him in my best french that I was 20 years old and he couldn't believe me. My dad told him that I have this prolem whenever I try to purchase cigarettes because I look so young, but it was useless.  I'm from Romania. Our ID's don't show our birthdates. The numbers are written in the personal ID code but he didn't understand that. Fortunately, he saw that my ID had "Romania" written on it. It so happened that his boss was romanian so he called for him to check out my ID. His boss greeted us like we were old family, checked it out and let me in. When we sat on the couch and got the menu from the waiter, we were shocked. The cheapest drink there was about 700 Euros and the most expensive one was 100 thousand. I'm not exaggerating even a tiny bit.[ Proof here](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0FiDxrzNlpY/UBlHJFxpgtI/AAAAAAAAAcM/jYazJd_VR7M/s1600/St.+Tropez++Don+267.jpg)We ordered some cheap champagne anyway because we didn't want to look bad. During smoke breaks we talked to the romanian boss of the bouncers. He was a really nice guy and we shared phone numbers and facebook profiles. The waiter noticed that we got along with him and smiled at us.At the end when my dad asked for the check the waiter informed us that it was all on the house. He thought we knew the boss of the bouncers! None of this would have happened if I wasn't mistaken for an underage person.

When I was in highschool, I used to be friends with this SUPER sheltered kid. He lived with his grandparents and they wouldn�t even let him leave his house without a �trusted friend,� AKA, somebody that they had �inspected� and deemed to be trustworthy. They also checked all of his internet history and only let him use the computer for one hour a day. I should mention that they were SUPER religious, like hardcore-level. Anyway, this friend got a flip-phone for his birthday and decided to try to use it to look up pornography. He was a brony, so naturally he tried to google pony porn. Make the long story short, he went to go grab his Nintendo DS and left his flip-phone on the couch. His Grandma decided to look through his flip-phone and saw that he had googled pony porn. She yelled at him for a solid hour straight and told him that he would go to hell and that Jesus would not accept him. Later, she took his flip-phone and smashed it. He had to attend bible school for a long ass time after this event.

Do not propose in hot air balloon. Then it�s just you and your love, and some weird guy named Phil whose job it is to fly hot air balloons. And then if it�s a no, you�re stuck up there in a wicker basket until with the person who just rejected you just a few feet away from Phil. Phil really should keep his comments to himself, but he�s a hot air balloon flier, he�s not known for his professional nature. So he starts with �oooooooh that�s rough, well don�t jump, my insurance won�t cover it.� And you just cry, Phil makes more comments but you can�t hear them. You can�t find I comfort in your partner because they�ve just rejected you, and Phil has got one hand on the flame thrower handle thing, the other is picking his nose. He chews what he finds in there. Forty five agonizing minutes pass as you slowly descend to earth. With a thud Leila jumps out and beelines to the car. You pay Phil the five hundred dollars and tell him he can keep the champagne. He says �you�re gonna need it more than me lover boy.� You take the bottle and drive you and Leila home in silence. She goes straight to bed and shuts the door. You sit on the couch nursing the champagne. When you wake up she�s gone. Her bag is packed and she�s left a note that says �I�m sorry, I�m going to stay with my sister. Call me when I can get the rest of my stuff.� You never call. Finally after two weeks she calls you. It takes you two calls before you pick up. You say she can pick up her stuff on Friday while you�re at work, it�s Wednesday. You decide to skip work and plan a romantic gesture to win her back. But when she shows up on Friday and you�re there with roses, she�s not alone. Phil hops out of the passenger side of the moving truck. You�re shocked. �YOU BASTARD,� you shout. To Leila you say �how long? What does this guy have that I don�t.� �A hot air balloon,� Leila says coolly. You fall to your knees on the lawn. Phil pats your shoulder as he walks by you into the house. Leila and Phil begin to move Leila�s stuff out. They rope you into helping, in your weakened emotional state you can�t say no. You go back into your house when they�re gone. It feels empty, like all the love is gone. Like all your dreams are gone. Flown away in a wicker basket. You hit the bottle again and look at the framed pictures of you and the woman you thought would be your wife. You rage and throw the photo into the wall, shattering the flame and the glass. You�re horrified with what you�ve just done, and run to the picture, one of the last pictures of Leila you have. You go to pick up the photo and cut yourself on a piece of the broken glass. It bleeds but doesn�t hurt. How easy it would be to just end it, you think. You pick up one of the pieces of glass and dig it into your wrist. As you bleed onto the floor you pass out.In the morning, you wake up with a terrible headache. You realize you must have passed out from the booze. You�re alive though. Idiot, you think, you can�t even commit suicide properly. You bandage your wrist and go back to pick up the pieces of the shattered picture, the pieces of your shattered life. Weeks go by and your house still feels empty. You notice your guitar sitting in the corner. It�s dusty and you haven�t played in at least a year. Two years? Who knows, Leila never liked the sound of you practicing. She never liked the blues either and you love the blues. What a perfect time to play some. You laugh at your private joke. It�s the first time you�ve laughed since that night. You pick up the guitar and mess around. It�s out of tune and your fingers feel clumsy, but it comes back quickly. Why haven�t I done this in so long, you think. And again you remember Leila. That she devil who never liked the blues, who left you for a hot air balloon pilot, driver, flier, whatever. You put the guitar down and feel a little better. It�s as if some semblance of the person you were before Leila has returned. You missed that person. You decide to never let anyone get between you and the guitar again. And you never do. A year goes by and you�re in a band. Something you never thought you�d do. You even burned the picture of Leila and threw out the last of her stuff. Burned it too actually. Sean said it might help. Sean is at your gig tonight actually. He brought a date, Jeremy you think his name is. Jeremy is there with his sister. You don�t know her name but Sean points you out on stage with to Jeremy and his sister. You wave. They wave back. You think you notice Jeremy�s sister smiling at you, her gaze lingering a little. You dismiss it and play your gig.You meet up with them after the show. You learn that Jeremy�s sister�s name is Kate. You introduce yourself.�Sean said this is your first gig ever?� Jeremy asks.�It was ya,� you say, �never thought I�d do something like this. My ex-� you wince. �My ex never liked the blues.��Sean told us,� says Kate �a hot air balloon pilot? The fuck kinda job is that?��He picks his nose too,� you laugh and your group does too.�And who doesn�t like the blues?� asks Kate, �I love the blues.�You smile and offer everyone a free round of drinks. You have tickets from playing a show.You and your friends have fun. Jeremy and Sean get a little drunk and stumble out together. You and Kate stay a little longer. Kate is pretty and you get along well. She�s a teacher in Seattle. You love Seattle.�Maybe I�ll move there,� you say.�Maybe you should,� says Kate.You hug goodbye and hail her a cab. It feels good to talk to a woman again. You forgot how good that felt. To feel charming. Leila never made you feel charming. You hadn�t noticed that until now. A few weeks later you decide you really will move to Seattle. You pack your stuff, rent your house, and go. It was your home growing up, so you miss it, an inheritance from your parents. Your father died years ago, and your mom passed away about a year after you met Leila. You remember she was excited to have a house, it makes you feel bitter now like it did then.You decide to play an open mic in Seattle and Kate comes with her husband. His name is John and he�s very friendly. You get along well. John and Kate applaud loudly and cheer after every song. You blush and laugh. The small crowd laughs at their enthusiasm, and seems to enjoy your music.After the short gig, Kate and John invite you to a barbecue that weekend. You say you�ll be there and you go. There are about ten other people at the barbecue. John and Kate have a nice house and you go for a tour. After, one of John�s coworkers bumps into you in the kitchen. She introduces herself as Hannah and says she works with John. John runs a small craft brewery, and Hannah is the head brewer.Hannah jokingly criticizes your beer choice. You laugh and give her a playful shove.�Revenge for bumping into me,� you say.You and Hannah hit it off and decide to get together again. Hannah invites you to get a beer with her at the brewery. You think that will be splendid.On the day you sample her new beer. She tells you it�s called the Floating IPA. She named it for her brother who�s coming by later to try it.�Oh he�s here early!� she exclaims and looks over your shoulder. You turn around. It�s Phil. Rage over takes you and you charge him. Before you know it you�re on top of him with your hands on his throat. Hannah screams and a few of the other brewers pull you off. They hold you back and Phil struggles to his feet. The brewers call the police and when they arrive Phil says he won�t press charges. He explains the situation. The police seem to understand. Hannah says you better leave. You do.A week later you get a phone call, it�s Hannah. You answer, surprised to hear from her.�Phil told me what happened.��Oh, ya.� You say.�You know, I love my brother, but to think a woman would leave you for him....� Hannah trails off, �he�s just such a dork,� Hannah finishes with a laugh. �He�s not with Leila anymore. He broke up with her. Apparently she�s a real piece of work. She had him convinced that you were abusive and that she was scared. He caught her cheating on him and the new guy was convinced he was abusive. Phil put it together that she�d probably done the same to you. He says he�s really sorry.��It�s ok, tell him I�m really sorry too.��Why don�t you? We�re going for drinks tonight before he heads back home �those balloons don�t fly themselves� apparently. Anyways he says you guys both owe each other a drink, or two.�You laugh and agree. You meet up with them later not sure what you�re getting into, but it goes well. Phil shakes your hand and says he�s sorry. You say you�re sorry too. You buy the first round and Phil tells you all about his experience with Leila. You bond over what a heinous hell creature she is. An hour later Hannah excuses herself to use the bathroom. You and Phil have become fast friends at this point.�Hannah�s single you know,� says Phil.�Ya, it was meant to be our first mini date when I strangled you,� you reply with a chuckle.�Oh man,� says Phil, �it probably wouldn�t be the worst first date she�s been on. She�s dated some real assholes. One girl she dated in a few years back left with a different girl midway through their first date, who does that?��Maybe Leila?�You both laugh.�You should ask her out again, I think she likes you.��Thanks,� you say, �I will. You�re a nice guy Phil. What a weird way to make a friend,� you say.Phil nods. You cheers your glasses as Hannah returns from the bathroom.You do ask her out again and this date is much better. You go for another and another. Soon enough she�s moved in with you. She works at the brewery and you�ve sold your old house to open a guitar shop. Business is good and Hannah comes by after close to hear you play. You play at home too. Hannah sings along to the songs she knows, dances to the ones she doesn�t. A year later you�ve bought a new ring. You call Phil to tell him your plan. He�s thrilled.�You sure you wanna do it that way?� He asks.�Ya, I think it�ll be sweet,� you reply.�Alright, see you soon pal.� Phil hangs up.Two weeks later you take Hannah for dinner. You walk through the park and meet Phil. He has a balloon ready to go. But this time you propose on the ground. She says yes. You hug her and kiss her deeply. Phil clears his throat.�Sorry!� You say.�Oh come her buddy,� Phil hugs you, �welcome to the family!�You hug him back with a grin.�Thanks,� you say �without you I don�t think my life would be as good as it is today.��HA! My pleasure. Just one thing though man. Why the fuck would you propose IN the balloon.��I thought it�d be romantic.��And was it?��You were there, what do you think.��This time will be.�You get in the balloon. Phil is right.

About 1 year ago I (being a lonely writer and feeling of little worth at the time) posted an unfinished story to 4chan's /b/ board, just to see how they would react. I could not have been prepared for the outpouring of interest they gave me. To be honest I'm still not really sure why that thread ended up doing well, but either way they seemed to like the story. They demanded some method of contacting me for an ending and I reluctantly gave out my garbage email which contained my handle 'hijidex'. A few users commented on the strangeness of the word and I, without thinking, explained it is my handle on every website ever.Well so I sort of forgot about all that until one day on steam someone commented on my profile with this linkwww.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/t9bio/one_story_ill_always_remember/asking if it had anything to do with me. Needless to say I was beyond touched. The fact that someone had gone through all that trouble for me and my simple story made me feel amazing. It took some time and some this and that, but I have finished the story for you guys.So without further ado, I present to you, in its entirety, the finished (but not edited) B-5021http://pastebin.com/eqjDpUATp.s. sorry if I did this wrong I have never really used reddit before so I do not know what I'm doing. If you guys can help make sure this reaches the appropriate eyes I would be forever grateful!

I�m a Westerner, but I�ve been living in Vietnam lately, and a while ago I started dating a Vietnamese girl. She�s not much younger than me but she was a virgin when we met. She�s decent at speaking English, but not perfect, and all of this coalesces into making her seem much more young and naive than she actually is. The first time I met her I said, �hi, my name is Max.� She had such trouble saying my name that she would just call me, �trai� (chai), which is an affectionate way of saying, �dude.� You see, Vietnamese doesn�t have an �x� or �cks� sound. In Vietnamese, the �x� letter makes an �s� sound, so my name in Vietnamese is more like, �mass.� So, anyway after we�d dated a while she told me she wanted to have sex with me. We do, and she has a great first time and she�s very happy about it all. It ends with me cumming on her belly and tits, and as soon as I do, with a big smile on her face, she triumphantly proclaims, �sess!,� like when a movie ends and they flash the title across the screen before the credits roll. It was positively adorable.

I work as a cleaner, and yesterday I was cleaning a school and as soon as I went about 20 feet close to a bathroom I felt a strong smell of shit. Didn't really pay much attention to it because sometimes people don't flush and that can stink, but when I opened the door, to my horror I saw a big fucking turd on the floor. Someone seriously just took a big shit and left it there. My coworker threw up when I showed to her, and I almost did too. We took a pic and sent it to the boss, he told us to just leave it there and said that he's gonna talk to the principal about it first thing tomorrow. Glad we didn't have to clean that

This was my second day of having my period (for the first time) and I didn�t really know that I had to change every 2-4 hours. so I went to school and had no pads with me and i didn�t leak until the end of the day lucky for me. our school chairs were grey and our school shirt is white, so I got up and saw that my chair had blood on it I wiped it with my sleeve and it went off the chair then my sleeve was covered in blood and we had to wear long navy skirts and when I checked to see how much blood was on my skirt there was a lot so I covered it up with my jacket and put my hand in my jacket as well. When I got in the car(with nanny and driver) I sat down then when we got home I get out only to see a s*** ton of blood on the seat I got home took a shower then went to tell my mom. She told the driver to go change the car seat, when someone would use our driver they would ask why I we changed the seats no one knows only my cousin(bestie).

For as long as I have been alive (21 years), I have been petrified of automatic flushing toilets. I refuse to use them even in the most dire circumstances. I remember after my cruise to Canada last year, we had gotten to the airport at 11AM even though our flight wasn�t until 11PM. To my dismay, every freaking toilet in the Vancouver airport had automatic flushing toilets that I could not bring myself to use. I had to poop so bad that I actually called my girlfriend to see if she could help give me moral support to just go use the toilets. Even with her support, I would walk in and out of the bathroom hyping myself up to do it, only to back out every time. When I couldn�t hold it any longer, I went in, barely squatted over one of the toilets and just dropped em in there. I didn�t even finish. I dropped 2 turds in and the toilet decided to flush so I quickly stood up and wiped and ran out. I am just so scared of the toilet flushing under me (which idk why it�s not like the toilet is gonna suck my balls down the drain). But that whole ordeal took about 4 hours. I held my poop from that time through the whole plane ride to Dallas and the whole time in Dallas and the whole ride from Dallas to Denver. (we had a connecting flight. And when we landed in Dallas, our flight got delayed 3 hours and they only have automatic toilets in Dallas. And in Denver). So I held my poop from 3 PM one day until 4 PM the next day when I finally got home all because I am petrified of automatic flushing toilets. Does anyone else share this fear? Or am I a weirdo who is the only person in the United States who is scared of automatic toilets lol and just a side note, there are 2 specific automatic toilets I will use because I know I can trust them. The one in the corner stall of the rec at my college and one at my rec back home. I�ve asked my family and friends about this for years and they all seem to be fine with the toilet flushing under them all loud and angrily so I figured I�d reach out to you guys to hear your feelings on this.

ok so this happened a year ago at my old house (don't don't live in that house anymore) so I kept on hearing noises in my basement which was weird so one night I was watching Netflix when I heard a smash but it didn't sound like a window was broken but like a cup or glass bottle so I called the police and grabbed a baseball bat and headed down stairs and I saw a man a whacked him on the side of the head and tied him up a minute past and the police had arrived I let them in and un-tied the man and he was cuffed. the next day I got a call and it was the police the guy was homeless and had got in through a window and was taken my food and stayed in the basement and they also found out that there was another guy who would stay the night now and then so I ended the call grabbed my baseball bat and headed down stairs thankfully there was no one there so I ran back up and checked everything to make sure they were locked and I stayed down stairs. and im glad I did because the homeless man came that night I called the police and shortly later the police came and they arrested the man the next day as previously I got a call and not surprisingly it was the police and they said that they arrested the guy and it was found he was high and had a hand made knife and was planning on killing me.

I wanted to make this for some creative writing for myself and others. Basically the stories must start with "sometimes" as their first word and expand upon that. My example is also what I plan to post to a 2 sentence horror story.Sometimes I like to lay down and look up into the sky. Sometimes this makes me feel an all encompassing sense of dread.

Every day at my job we have this little old lady that comes in. I won�t use her real name for privacy reasons so I�ll call her Joanna. One day in particular she came as usual, had her lunch, and had already left to go out to her car before I could wish her a good day and say goodbye. I motioned to my coworker (I�ll call him John)  and said �hey lets wave at her until she sees us!� We waved for almost ten whole minutes consistently and determined to make sure we got to say our goodbye for the day. Finally, from her car, she looks up and gets the biggest smile on her face and blows us both a kiss as she drives away. Me and my coworker high-fived each other and went about our day. Fast-forward, almost a week later, and she comes in while I�m working. She comes up specifically to me at the cash register and says �Oh my goodness, until the day I die, I will never ever forget you and John waving at me through the glass. It just meant so much to me! It�s just so hard sometimes, I don�t have any family around me and I just love you guys.� She was tearing up as she was telling me this, I still tear up when I think about it. It just made me realize that the way you act towards other people has a much bigger impact than you think. You have an opportunity to make or break someone�s day with your actions and words.

But, from the rubble, you hear a strange sound. Very awfully familiar, you get closer to take a closer look. You stop in your tracks, The last piece of working technology! You exclaim joyfully. The sound gets clearer, you realize it is playing the world anthem. You salute to the bluetooth speaker like hundreds of other people. A familiar person appears from the horizon, it is [president's name]! Together we will rebuild, together we will stand strong, together we will reunite our country and arise from the ashes, we will survive. Hundreds of people cheer [president's name] although before he was considered a bad person to some/most people. You wake up, you look outside the window, the usual ice cream truck passes by. You turn on your phone, it is 8 in the morning. Wait, you realize, my phone still works! You exclaim in joy. That was all a dream? You question yourself. You go on with your normal life, all of a sudden, the lights go out, the internet disconnects, the refrigerator's light is off. No! You shout, This can't possibly be happening! Then the electricity comes back on.

I like to cook, so I experiment with simple dishes like eggs or frying other things. sometimes I mix up sugar flour butter and milk to make a simple batter (I don't use measurements I just throw it togeather) I decided to microwave my doughy batter thing. It sure was steamy I thought to myself after i checked it after 30s. I then put it in for 3 minutes. I forgot about it and kept cooking my eggs.  only to notice a minute later that there was thick white smoke coming out of the microwave. I'm not doing that again.

This is a story about a guy named Liran. It's not MY story, it's just something that happend and is happening in my country.One day, someone named Liran showed up in the background of a news field report with a gray shirt. Slowely, people started noticing that he's on every news report out there. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. He would show up on more then one channel at the same time. GOD HE'S GOOD. He would just stand there in the background, doing nothing, always wearing a gray shirt. https://images.app.goo.gl/yZYT7JhHNRa1Zes88After years of this, he got the nickname "Liran chultsa afora" (Liran gray shirt), and news producers started paying him to just be there. They started inviting him to intervews, and he turned to be one of the greatest celebrities and memes in my country (i live in israel btw). HECK, HE WAS AT THE EUROVISION (for those who don't know, this is a massive singing contest for all of europe that happens every year).Now he's a thing, you can see him everywhere, and although people are researching about him, nobody truely knows who this guy is.This is a story about Liran, a guy that's only hobby is to be every where, never to be seen in a shirt other then a gray one.

The Massacre of DiamondSnarlThe year is 83. The month is Slate and spring has just hit the young dwarven fortress of DiamondSnarl. Celebrating 5 years since the pilgrimage of their founding dwarven brethren, they have grown to a considerable 79 citizens. Around mid slate a 15 dwarf group of migrants had just arrived. With them they had brought plenty of fat farm animals. While the new migrants settled into their new home, many of the citizens worked together to move the farm animals from the inside of the fortress to the outside pasture. Their mayor, Urist Dugenbrow, seeing that the pastures were getting full and their meat supply was getting thin, ordered that some of the bigger animals be butchered. Meanwhile in the distant hills a deadly predator loomed over the horizon. A wereboar, smelling the refuse from miles away, approached the fortress. What it found was even better: small little dwarfs going back and forth with meaty animals fresh for the kill.  Locking on a target, it charged at a lone fisherdwarf guiding a horse to the pens. The day so far had been uneventful for this dwarf, and was about to get worse as the wereboar charged foreword out of nowhere and clawed a chunk of flesh and fat from his shoulder. Wounded, he attacked back and called for help. Many of the citizens and new migrants, who were going outside anyways, ran to his defense. The wereboar was attacked from all sides by everyone and everything: dwarves, dogs, horses, pigs, random stray skunks, even a dwarven baby tried to help by latching onto the leg of the wereboar (which didn�t last long as the baby was soon stomped on and crushed by the wereboar.) One dwarf in particular stood out. He was a butcher named Odir. The wereboar focus particularly on him. As the wereboar slashed and bit massive chunks out of the dwarve, the dwarf swung back with massive meaty fists, putting dents in the wereboar and knocking out teeth. However the wereboar was far to strong for even a hard dwarf like himself. Before he died he thought about death, he felt unsettled. The wereboar stomped on his head and blood and brains splattered everywhere. A trail of blood shot in the air and landed ten feet away, covering the trading depot. At the sight of Odir�s grisly death, the citizens around scattered in all directions. Terrified citizens flooded out the gates of DiamondSnarl in a mindless panic, almost as if Armok himself has sent fire and brimstone upon their fortress. One of the dwarves near Odir�s mangled body, a dwarf named Agnoish, went insane and started attacking random citizens. A group of them ganged up on the bezerking dwarf and beat him until he was dead. One of the dwarves, a simple carpenter, ran to the barracks to raise the alarm to the military, a group called �The Meatboys�. The Meatboys were a 6 dwarf group of wrestlers (dwarfs trained in combat without the use of weapons). The Meatboys has been created 3 years earlier and had trained relentlessly day and night since. The greatest values of the Meatboys was sharing �brotherly love� and oiling up. The carpenter ran in and yelled out that the fortress was under attack and it looked like the end of the world, then ran out again. However the Meatboys were too busy wanking each other off and did nothing in response. When order had finally been restored, the wereboar was gone, and the entire outside of the fort was coated in blood and gore. There were seven dead. These seven were buried in tombs, massive amounts of alcohol were produced to help cope with these traumatic events, and a replacement for Odir was hired. However, his replacement had a hard time butchering animals because when he would go to cut up an animal he was�too horrified�. Every time he saw a butchered animal, he saw the face of a dead dwarf on the animal. Life continued normally again, but this time everyone was suffering PTSD from what must have feltlike the end of the world. All this started and revolved around one wereboar.And that is the massacre of DiamondSnarl. To this day no one has figured out what happened to the Wereboar.

This is my first time posting and english is also not my native language so if I make mistakes pls forgive me but lets get straight into the story now. So that day me and my friend group of 5 people decided to go eat at burger kings and we were all 13 years old. When we had ordered our foods we sat at a table and we noticed that there was this about 25-30 year old man sitting in the opposite table and I could see him easily. We didn't think much of him in the beginning. After about 20 minutes had passed I noticed that everytime I looked at him he was looking straight into my eyes and when I was taking pictures of my friend sitting in front of me I noticed from the camera that he was looking staight at me and my friend sitting next to me at all times. I think he targeted us two because we were the smallest ones. I could see him with my side eye the whole time and he just kept looking straight at me. At one point I started getting a little scared so I texted my friends about it because I didnt wanna say it out loud. They then texted back that they knew. We started taking pictures and videos of him and whispering about him and when he realized he whipped out his phone and covered his face with it. He pretended to use his phone for a moment until he thought we were done filming him. Then he started to stare at me and my friend sitting next to me again. We were all super scared at that point because he had finished his meal probably about 30 minutes ago and he was there just staring at me and waiting for us to leave. We were even too scared to go to the bathroom alone so went together. We finally started to leave because we were so scared. And guess what? THAT GOD DAMN PEDO LEFT AT THE SAME TIME AFTER WAITING FOR 2 HOURS! We all looked at each other in shock. We ran to the escalators. (The burger king we were at was in a small shopping centre and to get out you had to use the escalators) He followed us. We ran so fast in to the nearest store and we hid in there for five minutes.  He probably knew that we were there. Then we got out of the shopping centre real fast and got to our bicycles. We decided to head to the nearby library down the street to calm ourselves down. On the way there we saw him and he gave us a disgusting smirk. When we got there I had a few mental breakdowns. We then hid there for about 20 minutes because we wanted him to get off the nearby area so we could go home. He made so uncomfortable that it took me a long time to calm myself down. When we were sure he was away we rode home. Worst anxiety I've never felt. Pedos are the most disgusting thing in the world and you might say that it was just a coincidence but I know exactly what his intentions were and there is no excuse for what he did.TLDR: I was followed by a pedo after he stared at me for 2 hours in burger kings.

Great for a monday"I had a bad day, Nana, my grandson, Donovan, said to me on  the phone once when I called him after school.� He was only four years  old at the time and he went to Head Start. "Why did you have a bad day,"  I asked him.� "Cause I couldn't do nothing right at school,"� he  answered as though it had been on his mind all evening. "What did you do  wrong, Donovan?" "I couldn't do good on my speech," he said. I reminded  him of all the wonderful things about himself, and by the time we hung  up, he seemed to be thinking about other things, like picking on his  brother.� Actually, I understood exactly how a little thing could have  made his day bad.� Sometimes it's the small things that can mess up our  day.Richard  Carlson wrote a book called Don't Sweat The Small Stuff.� The book is  filled with phrases that gently remind us that life can be good even if  it's not always the way we planned it.� At the time, I worked with a  friend who told me that she was happy even though she had to move around  a lot because of her husband's job.� I asked how she did that. She  said, "It's because I carry my happiness with me."[What�s the Best Thing That Happened Today?](https://preview.redd.it/4f5au8r0izm31.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=60a0dfd0c0f1ee8e975bb7b84d63db29b1be975f)Carlson, who also wrote a book called, Don't Sweat The  Small Stuff at Work, writes that in a typical day, the average person  may have 10 things happen.� Nine of those may have gone fine, but one  did not work out so well. People often find themselves focusing on the  one thing that didn't work instead of the nine that were fine.� And if  you do that everyday, after awhile it will seem like everything in your  life is going wrong, when it really isn't.Sometimes at the end of the day it is good to ask yourself,  "What's the best thing that happened to me today?"� If you write it  down, you may see that the good things out-weighed the bad things.�  There is another book that is good for people who feel like they have a  lot of bad days.� It is, How to Stop Worrying and Start Living, by Dale  Carnegie.� Carnegie suggests that when you have a problem, you should do  three things:� write it down, decide if you can do anything about it,  if so, make a plan, and then let it go.Not a lot different from the Serenity Prayer:� "God grant  me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to  change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference," I knew  my grandson was too young to understand all this right now, but I  decided to call him back the next day to see how his day was.� When his  mother gave him the phone, I said, "How was your day, Donovan?" "It was a  good day, Nana," he said. "Is that because you did well in school  today?" I asked.� "Nope, I didn't go to school today!" he said, and then  he handed the phone to his mother and went back to playing with his  toys.[https://www.morningcoffeebeans.com/2019/09/16/whats-the-best-thing-that-happened-today/](https://www.morningcoffeebeans.com/2019/09/16/whats-the-best-thing-that-happened-today/)&#x200B;## Other Stories From My blog## Can You Hear the Wind?The  first time my husband received a cross over hearing aid, he was  astonished when we stepped outside the doctor�s office. �Do you hear  that,� he asks.� �What?� I asked. �The wind, he said.� I can hear the  sound of the wind.� Most people take hearing for granted until they lose  it.

They�re speaking but yet Rosemary wasn�t listening, instead she was humming along to the beat of students pencils thumping. She was also staring into the back of a random boy�s head, counting the small blonde hairs on his acne ridden neck.���� �Rose?� Said her friend Willow but no response from Rosemary since she was now guessing which pimple would pop first.

 �*Hey beautiful*� I said hoping she didn�t hear the anger or sadness in my voice. �**what the fuck is going on over there**!� she screamed through the phone. �*Ashley...she...attac..*�� I tried to say but was cut off �**thats not what I heard from Nicole! And from this picture you look like your enjoying yourself**!� she screamed again. �*beautiful you know I would never.... I love you with all my heart you know that you have to believe that.........Kaitlyn....*�  \*click\* �shit� I said to myself as I tried calling her back.... it rang  twice then went to voice mail, I tried calling again and it was  straight to voice mail �shit� I said again as I went through my contacts  finding Laurens numbers and pressing call.... � *Hey this is Lauren leave a message or shoot me a text!*� damn it voice mail �*Lauren  please tell your sister nothing happened this was all just a misunderstanding.  Tell her I love her and I would never cheat on her please please.*�  Tears welling up in my eyes now, I put my phone in my pocket and took a  deep breath trying to steady myself. I walked back outside to where  everyone was sitting, Mike saw me first and got up getting between me  and the rest of the group. I could see Billy was ready if I tried to do  something stupid so I took another breath. Ashley looked up and smiled  her devilish smile again �*Fuck you, you stupid no good whore*� I said as calmly as I could, her smile instantly vanished. �*Nicole look at me� her eyes darted in my direction �I expected better from you she trusts you and you betrayed her and me...i hope you burn in hell*�  I was crying again I couldn�t help it and with that I turned around and  walked back into the house. I grabbed a 12 pack of beer from the  fridge, got in my car and raced home not caring about traffic laws or  other motorists.� Mom  came home and found me in the garage sitting in the Mustang with a beer  in my hand, 7 empty cans lay around with the rest of the 12 pack on the  passenger seat. One look told her everything and without saying a word  she walked over and hugged me as best could. I immediately started  crying again, she asked me what happened and I related the whole ugly  story. Mom and I were never as close as we would have liked to have been  but when it came to things like this she was always there for me. �*what do I do mom? She turned her phone off I tried to explain what happened but she wouldn�t listen I feel so lost*�  I slurred. I was pretty drunk at this point and opened another beer  hoping this would be the one that would numb the horrible feeling I had  in my heart. Mom took a second before answering �*Honey  this is one of those situations that can�t be solved instantly, Kaitlyn  is probably feeling just like you are right now give her the rest of  the night to think about things and try calling her first thing in the  morning I'm sure things will be ok*� I hugged her again with tears rolling down my face. �*ok mom*� I said trying to sound like I was ok but we both knew it was a lie. �*lets get you into bed*� she smiled her best mom smile and helped me out of the car and up to my room. I got into bed and passed out within seconds. I  woke up Monday morning with a splitting headache, I tried to focus and  clear my head but it wasn�t working. I grabbed my phone hoping it would  bring some good news. Nothing except a text from Mike asking if I was  ok, I ignored it. I tried calling Kaitlyn but no it went straight to  voicemail again. I thought about leaving a voicemail but I couldn�t find  my voice so I hung up. I sent her a text asking her to call me when she  got a chance it was important. With that I dragged myself to the  kitchen to find something to eat. There was a note on the counter, got  called in early we can talk later if your  feeling up to it call me if you need anything love mom. I grabbed some  food and a glass of water and went back to my room for the rest of day.

Back in like 2015 or so I had a crush on this really hot girl and she would go out of her way to be nice to me, she would always invite me to her house so I thought I would ask her out on her birthday. I get to the party and I'm the only guy there, im thinking I'm the luckiest guy ever. The time comes and I ask her if she wants to go on a date.... She screams and runs in the bathroom. Her friends then inform me that she thought I was GAY. Her proof? I hang out with guys. It was an awkward 20 minutes until my mom picked me up. I'm still shook.



******************************



On a sunny summer day my friend and I decide to go for a walk towards my old elementary school to go swing on the playground. All of the sudden a huge black truck speeds by. My friend and I yell at the truck to slow down because there were kids playing in a yard across the street. My friend and I continue walking when the same truck speeds towards us. My friend and I thought oh great we yelled at a lunatic. We start sprinting down the sidewalk, he parks down the one side and we run the other way, the truck goes out of sight and we stop to breathe. Then my mom calls my cell and I tell her what�s happened and she says to go home. So we start walking back to my house and the truck comes back, we run the other way hoping to get toward my other friends house that wasn�t far. My mom is still on the phone this whole time hearing running and screaming. The truck cuts us off and rolls down the window. Turns out it�s a guy we know from school. We start cussing him out like crazy. I hear screaming and it�s my poor mom wondering what�s going on and if she needs to call the police, I tell her what happened and she starts cussing out the guy too. To this day I keep my mouth shut when a car drives by because I do not want to relive that and it be real.

Racing on the sidewalk behind a Starbucks coffee shop, Jen is becoming impatient with her dealer. She checks her phone again, no new messages. The withdrawals are taking a stranglehold on her now. Sweating in the hot summer, the withdrawals have fully encircled her body. She needs her fix quickly. The sun will be setting soon, mimicking the oncoming darkness that is enfolding inside her.She spots her dealer lumbering along, heavy-footed. Jen�s withdrawals are quickly forgotten and the anticipatory high of the oncoming fix take control. She does the exchange wordlessly. Holding the small package in her hand gives her such relief. She enters a Starbucks and slips into the washroom. Rushing to take out her kit, fumbling with the spoon and partially losing a small amount of the powder. The needle is ready and she injects into a used vein in her leg. The heroin rush engulfs her after five seconds. Complete bliss. She meditates for a moment, soaking in the opiates. Her energy back, looking in the mirror, fixing herself up, smiling. Smooths out her ruffled brunette hair, adjusts her black tank-top over her slithe build and washes the blood trickling down her leg.She walks out of the coffee shop confidently, completely different from when she first walked in. Walks to the ravine near her apartment building and begins to feel tired. She stops.�Hey,� a familiar voice greets her from the corner of her eye. It�s her boyfriend Geoff. He�s sweating profusely with sweat-stains all over his shirt. A sinister grin plasters his lips.�Hey,� she replies nervously.�It�s over between us,� he says with a straight-face, still grinning.�What?��It�s over.��Where�s Sam?��Sam�� he laughs as he turns around and runs down the sidewalk, laughing even louder. Jen is about to run after him when she hears a high-pitched wailing cry. She gasps. It�s Sam! The cry is coming from deep down in the ravine. She rushes down the ravine, wrestling through the overgrown shrubs and sliding down the steep incline. She falls and stumbles through trees and rocks, tearing her clothes and scraping her legs and back. She gets to the bottom and stands up, inching closer to Sam�s cry. She finds Sam in a muddy pool. Sam is bloodied and bruised around her face, her pajamas are torn with bloodstains all over them. She picks her up and cradles her muddy four-month old infant, trying to console her. The sun has set and darkness has taken over.Jen runs through a street to the main intersection, holding her squalling baby. Screaming and crying, she calls out to a police car driving by. The vehicle comes to a stop in front of her. Two burly officers, one unshaven and the other clean-shaven, exit their car. �What�s going on here?� the clean-shaven one asks, with the name McDonald displayed on his nametag.�My baby, she was....� Jen begins.�What happened to that baby?!� the unshaven officer named Macy interrupts. He reaches over to grab hold of Sam. Jen retaliates and tries to hold onto Sam but she loses her grip. In the struggle as Macy takes the baby she trips and falls on her side. The package in the front pocket of her torn jeans falls out. McDonald comes to pick her up and notices the package.�What you got there?� McDonald opens the package to reveal the powder. �Oh look what we have here.� He shows the package to Macy then places it on the hood of his car. He grabs the handcuffs from his belt and restrains Jen while reading her rights.She�s in shock. Not only did she suddenly lose her child but now is arrested for the package she knows she finished in the Starbucks washroom. Sam is crying and thrashing about in Macy�s arms, momentarily distracting McDonald. Jen quickly runs down an alleyway in the direction of the ravine. She hears the footfalls of one of the officers racing behind her. The footfalls are getting closer to her but she manages to reach the edge of the ravine and fling herself off of it. She half flies through the air and half slides down the steep incline. When she reaches the base of the ravine she stands up and feels a painful sprain on her right ankle. Even with the pain she sprints down the path for a little while until she becomes too exhausted. Looking back, she�s relieved that she has outpaced the cop. She makes her way down the path toward the exit of the ravine, limping along.Racing through the maze-like alleyways maniacally, she�s heading to her friend Beth�s townhouse. The handcuffs at her back she�s hiding underneath her tanktop to avoid suspicion. Even so, many passerby�s give her awkward glances, mainly because of her disheveled appearance. She makes it to the townhouse and knocks on the door. Beth appears after a while, looking extremely high. She begins to laugh at Jen.�What the hell happened to you?� Beth laughs mockingly.�Can you guess?!� Jen shows her handcuffs.�Oh my god!� Beth shuts the door and leads Jen inside the house. They walk to the living room and Jen notices Beth�s familiar guests. All crackheads, some smoking while others are sitting high, either comfortably or twitching and scanning the floor for crack remnants.�Please Beth, give me a hit,� she pleads, as she relays the story of Sam and the cops. Beth gets out her pipe and sticks it in Jen�s mouth, putting a stone in it and lighting it. The high blends in with the opiates, creating an intense euphoria. For a few moments she forgets about her problems, even Sam. She barely notices Beth fumbling at the handcuffs with a coat-hanger wire.�I can�t get these �cuffs off,� Beth says after trying for fifteen minutes. Jen is starting to fidget, becoming paranoid. This always happens when she smokes crack. The sight of all the crackheads adds to her unease. She runs to the door. �Where are�� Beth calls out but Jen�s gone.Walking down a street, all Jen wants to do is go home. Her paranoia is eating away at her and people continue to glance at her suspiciously. She�s still trying to hide her handcuffs underneath her shirt but it�s useless, everyone can plainly see. Suddenly in the corner of her eye she spots a police car pulling over next to her. She runs into tbe shopping mall near her, descending down the stairs. She makes it to a nearby McDonalds restaurant when she stops and turns around, unable to run anymore with the pain in her ankle. Two police officers, these ones different from before, are charging at her.�No, please, don�t!� she screams.�...iss, miss, miss,� someone is shaking and speaking to her. She looks up and sees a middle-aged woman staring at her with a concerned expression on her face.�What�s going on?� Jen asks.�You came in here and just stood here, closed your eyes, fell asleep, and started screaming,� the woman replies. Jen stands in front of the McDonald�s on the food court confused.�The cops!� she yells.�Cops? What cops?� the woman looks confused. Jen looks around and sees no officers, only a few shoppers looking at her with concerned expressions like the woman�s and some stores like Walmart, Winners, Macy�s, and H&M. She moves her arms in front of her. No handcuffs. Not even any red marks from when Beth was pulling on them to unlock them. Beth.�Do you need help? Do you want me to call the police?� the woman asks.�No, no,� Jen replies as she walks towards the stairs, noticing no pain in her ankle. She steps out of the mall and finds no police car. She reaches for her cellphone and calls Beth.�Hello,� Beth answers.�Beth was I over at your place today?� Jen asks.Beth begins to laugh, obviously high. �No. What are you talking about? Are you high?�Jen hangs up the phone. Sam. She calls Geoff. �Jennifer where are you?� Geoff answers with an angry tone.�Where is Sam?! Is she okay Geoffrey?� Jen hears Sam crying in the background.�We�re at home waiting for you. Where the hell are you?!�Jen remains silent.�You�re high aren�t you! Don�t tell me you have to go again to reha�� Jen hangs up the phone.She realizes that she must�ve nodded off after taking the heroin. She hallucinated everything. This isn�t the first time.   She feels the incoming withdrawals taking hold of her body. She calls her dealer.&#x200B;By; Mark Zemla

This is a true story about what happened to me while I was at work. To clarify, I work at a Dunkn�Donuts located in the NSA headquarters. I was on break in the lunchroom when I heard a loud noise coming from down the hall. And me being the curious person I am, headed towards the sound only to find that I had come to a locked door. Of course, this is not uncommon to find locked doors in a national security building. And a few days later I heard that same sound. Both times, it sounded like a deeply pitched wind with a slight gargle. It also seemed like no one else could hear this sound. I had asked my manager if she heard it and was told she had not. The second time was similar to the first, but I also heard people yelling at each other. After the sound stopped I was able to hear that they were yelling about a plug or something. Also sometimes I hear quiet music coming from that room, but only these two times had I heard that odd and unsettling sound. If any other interesting things happen I will share them. Keeping you all posted. I will probably post under my /u or just edit this.Also if anyone knows of a sound that may sound like this maybe you could tell me I know it�s pretty much impossible to explain sounds via text but it could have been electrical because they were yelling about a plug but it could have been about something else.&#x200B;Edit:  Ok, I got back from work today and I feel that I need to give you guys some updates. I noticed a guy watching me all day while I worked. I don't know who he is and I don�t think he knows about my account on here. Also, I saw a man walking down a hall who kept mumbling to himself. He had a bright red face and was sweating profusely. I can't quite put a finger on it. But things just seem off now that I have been more observant. I'm probably just over thinking things but it almost seems like somebody in the NSA hq knows about all this. For example, the guy who was watching me the whole day sat next to me during lunch break and started telling me about some government program he called PIPA. I think he said it stands for Public Intelligence Protection Agency. He was talking about public protection stuff in media. Hearing that I just thought of my posts on here Reddit. I hope I�m just overthinking it. I�m starting to distrust people now.&#x200B;[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Sso56Sv5alICRfPVnuy4T7IbLe7E9cvW](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Sso56Sv5alICRfPVnuy4T7IbLe7E9cvW)

So i was in 4th grade and quite honest, i was a stupid little kid lol. We had a teacher that when the fat kid from our class ran in front of him, the teacher would give him a little pat in the back.So i told my friends ''I think the teacher is in love with the fat guy'' and all my friends were surprised but i only made that comment once. Two days later the teacher approaches me and basically told me what i said was wrong (i don't remember exactly what he told me tho).&#x200B;Later in life when i was like 12 i realized that i could've ended his career, marriage, and probably his life if only the rumor would've spread more.I did it without knowing the implications of that... i'm ashamed..... XD

Dear Daniel and Abigail, September 24th, 2011. Daddy was running a coffee shop at the time, and had reconnected with an old friend. Uncle Stan had just moved to an apartment in Westwood, and there was going to be a housewarming/UCLA MBA school party there. By the time I arrived, the entire 3 bedroom apartment was standing space only, like it was a concert.Your mother was in the kitchen. I went in there to get a drink and she was there with her friend, near the sink across from the fridge. She was wearing a dress, beige on top and black from waist down. She looked beautiful. Plus she had a type of smile that I could instantly trust... a genuine smile, like she had nothing to hide. As I often do, I used my expert-level conversational powers to grab her attention.    D: Hi, I'm Jinu (smile)    M: Hi, I'm Mae (smile) Shake hands. Now I like to joke around about how it was at that exact moment that she fell in love with me. Not true. She fell in love with me as soon as we met eyes.Daddy will give a grade to his confidence at the end of every line.    D: So how do you know Stan? (Confidence Grade: A)    M: Who?    D: Uhhh, Stan? How do you know Stan? (Confidence Grade: B)    M: Oh I'm just here with my friend Jasmine. She knows Johnny.    D: Who? (Confidence Grade: C)    M: Uhh, Johnny? He lives here.     D: Ohhh ok. my friend Stan just moved in with some guys, I guess they're roommates.    M: Oh, I see....Silence. (Confidence Grade: D)Rough start. But when a conversation is at its end, but I still want to hear them talk, I ask:    D: So what do you do?    M: I'm a pharmacist.    D: Oh you are?I have a hazy memory of how the rest of the conversation went, so I'll fill in the rest:    D: So I'm currently suffering from acid reflux, and have been taking this pill called 'xxxxx'.         Have you heard of it?    M: Yes, yes I have    D: So what's the side effect? Is it gonna give me toe cancer when I'm 70?    M: They ruled out finger cancer but not toe,         so if I were you I'd take more selfies with your toes before you no longer can.     D: Well I'll just draw it in afterwards.    M: Haha. So what do you do?    D: I have a small coffee shop in Koreatown.     M: Oh what's it called?    D: 'xxxxx' coffee shop.    M: Mmm I think I've heard of it    D: Wow, that's actually very coolSo the conversation went something like that, and after some beer pong and such, I was very tired, anxious from socializing, and wanted to go home. I told her that I had a long day and would be heading out, and before I can ask her, she asked me:        M: what are you doing tomorrow?    D: I was actually going to ask you the same. Would you like to have coffee with me tomorrow?So that's the night Daddy met your mom. Happily ever after. Just kidding. Normally ever after.

This has got to be one of the most ridiculous events of my life that I doubt I�ll ever let go of. See, here�s what happened. I�m a Khmer student who had just recently moved to London sometime in September 2018 for college, so I was currently 15 years old. Since my relatives that do live in London live either in a different city or too far away from the college, my parents signed me up to stay in the college accommodation, which is only a ten minutes walk apart. In the accommodation there are two types of room, the single and the double. Since I was under 16, the teachers suggested I share a room with someone else, which I didn�t have a problem with.For the first and second week in the accommodation I stayed alone in the room and it was really peaceful, too bad it ended. When my roommate first came I was just returning from school and I found her and her mom unpacking her things into the room. It was a very awkward meeting, turns out she�s from Thailand, which was weird because I�m from Cambodia, two countries that don�t have the best relationship with each other, though that wasn�t really a problem since I didn�t enjoy discriminating people. Normally it�s nice to have some company around, but it then got a little out of hand. My roommate didn�t seem to understand the meaning of personal space. She would always try to start up conversations with me and showed me pictures of other people on Instagram then asked questions whether I think they are pretty or not. That made me really really uncomfortable, she even did it while I was trying to study or do my homework and it gave me a headache. To be honest she did a lot more things I couldn�t stand, but I kept it to myself and wondered how long would it be before i snapped. Surprisingly, instead of me asking to swap roommates, she did it first.During one of our P.E classes the teacher decided to take us all out for a stroll. When we were walking over a bridge I decided to take some pictures of my friends and our teacher. My roommate got mad at me because she said I took a picture of her without permission, which I didn�t. What actually happened was that I took a picture of my teacher and she got caught in the background, very far in the back. She yelled at me to delete the picture, which I didn�t want to because it�s the only picture of our teacher I took, but I deleted anyways. She told me that she didn�t believe me when I told her I deleted it and even demanded I give her my phone so she can see, which I refused, then she threatened me that she was going to complain to the house parents, the adults that look after us in the accommodation, she even added that she had already complained about my behavior before and was requesting a room change. This was new to me, especially since I tried my best not to be a bother to her, usually the opposite happens.After school had ended and I got back to our shared room my roommate was not in, meaning she had gone out with her Thai friends like she did almost every other day, so I decided to leave a note on her bed that if there were any problems between us then we should talk it out civilly, I didn�t even want to bring the topic back up since I�m not one for confrontation. And when she did game back, it was like nine or ten and I was already attempting to sleep. When she came back, she had two of her Thai friends with her and all three cane into the room. I didn�t appreciate this because it�s a shared space and I don�t like the idea of people looking at my stuff, especially if they were complete strangers. When my roommate saw the note she read it out loud to her friends, even though I was sitting right there on my bed wide awake. After they read the letter, my roommate and her friends came over to me and she just told me that she didn�t like my behavior, which is ridiculous considering 99% of the time it was her who ever bothered to start up random conversations and never stops. I just let her rant for a while before trying to explain myself how everything may just be a misunderstanding, I wasn�t even trying to complain about the whole situation, I was willing to just settle on it all being a miscommunication between us.Before I could even properly explain myself, her friend just cut me off, saying she dealt with people like me before. I was taken aback by this, firstly, this situation was between me and my roommate so I saw no reason for her to butt in, and second, I don�t even know her! I�ve seen her every now and again with my roommate, but we have never ever as much made direct speech towards one another. And now she is saying she have dealt with people like me. In what terms, people from my country or of my personality? I�m pretty sure she does not know what I�m like since I�ve never spoken to her before, yet she just continues to berate me like she knew me better than I did. After one of the worst one sided argument, because I barely utter two sentences in the entire exchange, they decided to leave the room to go complain to the house parents, that or they decided to go out even though it was almost past curfew. When they leave a house parent came and asked me about the situation since they had a complain from my roommate. Instead of ratting out to her about the truth of the dilemma, I just told her that I wasn�t sure what is going on and that I wasn�t aware that I had been a bother to her, assuming it had all been a misunderstanding. We talked for a while, she asked me if my roommate had caused me any trouble which I denied, even though my subconscious was screaming at me to spill out my frustration with my roommate and her annoying antics. She then left and said that she and the other house parents would sort things out.A little later my roommate came back, barging in and made a beeline towards my bed. I was busy at the moment crying and soothing myself with my ninjago plushie. It was a doll of a character I was really inspired by. So when my roommate came in, the first thing she did once she reached me was yelling at me. I don�t really remember the whole conversation, but it went down something like this.(R=roommate) (K=me) (Hp=house parent)R: K are you trying to kill me?!K: What are you going on about?R: Are you trying to kill me?! Are you using black magic?!K: What? That doesn�t even make sense. What could have possibly happen for you to come to this assumption?R: I was going downstairs and nearly fell down the stairs.K: So you trip. How does that link with black magic?R: When I nearly fell down the stairs, my chest started hurting. My friend told me that you were using black magic.Wow. So because she trip and could have fell down and her chest hurts, the first conclusion she and her friends made was that I was trying to kill them with black magic, it was obvious her friend had told a load of bs. It made no sense because I wasn�t anywhere near her when it had happened, she was on the stairs near the ground floor, as she had told me later on, and I was talking to a house parent in our room on the second floor! It was just one false accusation to the next. She said I was annoying her ever since we became roommates and now she is accusing me of attempting murder.The argument escalated to the point that she assumed that my doll was cursed, and that was when I snapped. The entire time I wasn�t even trying to defend myself, but she pretty much crossed the line when she slandered Lloyd, the character of the my doll. I told her she was crazy and should not openly speak of ridiculous things about other people. Of course, she didn�t listened to me, instead she took out some pendent which her friend gave her to �protect her from the black magic�, which is a little strange as to why her friend would have something for that kind of purpose in the first place. I tried to ignore her but then a house parent came in, it was the same one from earlier.Hp: R, you can change room tomorrow, but you�ll have to stay here for tonight.R: But I need to change rooms now, can�t I just stay with one of my friends?Hp: We don�t have any rooms available and nobody can make the change now.FYI, this stupid overdramatic event had extended for so long that it was pretty much past twelve.R: You don�t understand, I can�t stay here.  Hp: You have no where to sleep then.R: I can just sleep on the floor in my friend�s room.Hp: R you are being very uncooperative.R: I can�t sleep here. If I stay something bad will happen to me.Hp: You are being very rude to K. You are going to sleep here tonight and change rooms tomorrow. K, are you okay with her staying here tonight?K: I don�t care. She can stay or leave if she wants, it�s none of my concern. But if she doesn�t want me to be her roommate, then she is the one who will have to change rooms, because I�m not moving from this room.After some attempts and persuasive (more like authoritative) words, my roommate reluctantly agreed to stay for the night. But once the house parent left, the drama continues.R: K, can you promise me that if anything happens to me, you�ll take responsibility?!WTF?!! K: Hey, I�m not taking responsibility of something I had no control over. If you do die, it�s not like I could prevent it, that�s like saying I�m responsible for shooting someone even though that person was never even shot in the first place. (But now I wish Lloyd was cursed so he can kill her for insulting him.)I couldn�t even sleep after that, my roommate just kept playing some stupid prayer on her phone to ward off the evil spirits from me and my doll. There�s a line between logic and utter stupidity which she had obviously crossed. I didn�t get any sleep till it was like 4 am, worst of all, it was a school night so I was going to be in a real tired state once we were back in our classes.What made the whole thing more annoying was that the next day while she was packing her things, her mom came to help her move. The moment I walked in I could hear her mom scolding her. As far as I�m concerned, her mom doesn�t hate me. I tend to be polite towards adults and a good influence as she had once called me. My roommate asked me if I had wanted her to stay or not. I could tell she simply wanted me to say yes, because she doesn�t want to bother packing and having to move, and I don�t want to make any bad impression or any unnecessary conflict, which she knew well, but I didn�t want to give her what she wanted either. If I said I want to let her stay, then she�ll probably make me talk to the house parents that it was okay for us to still be roommates, if not then she would have to talk to them herself which would only make her look worse since she was the one who had started the problem in the first place. I made sure my answer was logically and not offensive in anyway.K: You can stay, you can leave, that�s your choice. Whatever you choose wouldn�t be any of my concern. I�m just going to focus on my studies and I�m not letting any minor issues get in the way of it. As long as you don�t get in the way of that then I don�t care what you do.To my relief, she moved out by the end of the day. I got a new roommate who�s from Iran and she and I so far are on good terms with each other, so all�s well that ends well. I mentioned that there were other things my first roommate had done that I couldn�t stand, but just kept it to myself. Here�s a list:- interrupting my calls with my family - never stops calling me even if I�m in class- brings up pointless random conversations while I�m studying - calls me when I�m doing homework and still refuses to hang up when I said I was busy- show me random pictures of girls on Instagram and asking me if they are pretty or not pretty (she does this everyday)- leaving her makeup everywhere - wants me to change the trash bag in the bathroom even though I never used it once- uses the mirror on my closet door and never closing it when she�s done, leaving my closet wide open- keeps her things on my side of the room- invading my personal space- ask me to wake her up in the morning then complains I never let her sleep- says I�m rude to her friends even though I never spoke to them before - uses my trash can, which I�m responsible for changing it when full- asks personal questions about my friends which I should never speak of without their consent- wants me to judge people based on appearance - keeps asking about her appearance, which I will care about when hell freezes over- wants to eat out when she barely knows how to use google map- asks questions of what I would do in scenarios which I promise I would never let happen to me (smoking, doing drugs, drinking alcohol, dying my hair, going clubbing, etc)- makes me to do her laundry and change her sheets for her

No I'm not making this up. My mom worked for Corbis (or however you spell it), and thus had company dinners with Bill Gates.Now, I dont remember how, but one time my parents got to have dinner across a table from Bill Gates.This is where the story technically starts.Mrs. Gates went to the bathroom before the food got to the table, and when she got back, the food was on the table.She then took a big scoop of what my parents think she thought was mashed potatoes, which was actually horse radish, and then put a bite into her mouth.She then started fanning her mouth because of the spicy horse radish, and Bill Gates said "I dont think that's going to help dear."This marks one of the craziest stories my family has. The only other crazier story is the one about how my grandma knows what happened to Jimmy   Hoffa...or maybe the one with Lorenzo...or the story of my dog thinking a turtle is invisible.

I want everyone to know that this is a true story. This isn't some made up bullshit on r/nosleep. This is true. I didn't my grandfather for very long. He was never in my father's life up until the end his, only for a year or two. He was a very angry man with a temper that could make a bull back down. He was always kind to me but not many others. He liked to drink and dabble in drugs. He was an abusive man but I loved him none the less. He had a heartattack a few years after I got to know him. It broke my heart because I loved that man and he loved me. I still keep his picture on my bedside table.. but that's besides the point, sorry for rambling. In the 80's during what I like to call the cocaine craze, he was a big time and highly respected cocaine dealer. He would travel 45 miles out off the coast of Florida to pick up large shipments of cocaine from Cuba. I've heard many stories of him killing dealers that rip him off and what concerned me the most. Innocent people. He enjoyed traveling out and spending all day out at sea between the coast of Florida and Cuba which is only a 90 mile stretch. He wasn't on a job at those times so he had no reason to be out there other than his pastime. He would find Cubans on makeshift rafts and boats and turn them over. He would sit on his boat and watch them drown, whole families dying together as he watched. He did this many times throughout his life. No one ever noticed because the people in Cuba just assumed they made it and those in Florida didnt know because they weren't expecting anyone. Anyone who found out what happened werent thinking that someone did it to them because theres a big risk associated with traveling 90 miles of ocean on nothing but a small raft or even inner tubes. He was a tough, cold, unfeeling man and certain family members of mine had the audacity to enscribe "Do all things with love" on his gravestone. Such disrespect. Thanks everyone for listening to this, just thought it would be a fun story for some or scary for others. But as I said in the beginning, it's all true. If you have any questions regarding my grandfather, who we was or what he did feel free to message me or comment and I'll answer any questions I get. Cheers.

So my roommate (R) and I have been really good friends for 4 years now and he recently gotten a gf 4 months ago. One night the three of us goes to a friend's birthday party at his apartment  and there was alcohol involved. So R and I started playing drinking games with our friends and let's say we didn't have the best of luck and ended up drink alot more than we can handle. So the party went from the apartment room to the hot tub. My drunkeness was getting out of hand as the hot tub was making me more dehidrated so R's GF gotten an Uber and we went back to out apartment and that's when R and I both black out. GF changed in R's room only to come out to see us both throw our swim trunks in the washer and fight each other naked to see who takes a shower first and passed out on the floor in exhaustion. She put a cover over us and takes a shower and sleeps in R's bed. We both wake up to the smell of food, only to figure out that we woke up next to each other scared and naked. Trying to find out how we ended up on the floor in the nude. R quickly goes to he's room to look for his GF and I ran in my room to get dressed. R doesn't see GF in his room. I kinda thought about what woke me up and head to the kitchen and found GF making breakfast for all of us  and her found ring and it's R on the other line.R: what happened, where are you.. I'm sorry .... I'm so so sorryGF: oh I went back to my place seeing how you wanted to be with your best friendR: IDK what happened last thing I remembered was playing America vs Vietnam and then the hot tub. GF: we'll talk about after you get something to eat and take a AdvilR: ok*Hangs up*Roommate walks to the kitchen and asked what I was cooking only to see GF making out plates. GF started to explain what had happened after we gotten really drunk. R and I did not look or talk to each other for a while. GF laugh and said we looked adorable like Little siblings fighting each other.  It's now an inside joke between us three.

So, im a magician, and I was performing at a mall. I went up to this one girl and jokingly I said "If I manage to impress you can I get a kiss?" Then she just says "we'll see". So I then do the trick and I finish it.She just stands there, she then turns around and tells me to follow her. So I do, we end up in the bathrooms making out. After 30 mins of that she asks me to take her to my house. I end up taking her to my house and long story short I got laid. I end up getting her number and she leaves.  This might sound like a lie because when I told my sister she thought I was lying.

So a few years back, during my high school years, one night, the whole family, me included went for grocery shopping. This was a big supermarket, relative to the size of my country cause our country's really REALLY SMALL (see how I emphasize on small). (SUMMARY OF STORY AT END OF POST) That night we were grocery shopping and I was on my own cause we all went our own ways to see what we wanted we all had 3 carts. Picture a family of 5, parents and 3 kids, one brother(me, eldest) and 2 sisters (one still in primary school ffs, who has the skin condition called eczema, google it up if you dont know. i dont know how to describe it, let's call her A). I am on my own, my mom with A and my dad with the other (let's call her B). At some point, I meet up with my mom and A. I could tell that A was a bit frustrated because she was talking with a serious tone instead of goofy voice (imagine an 7-8 yrs old one) and she and dad filled me up about that crazy lady.&#x200B;What happened according to what they told me:A:\*picks up a yoghurt she might think she likes\*Crazy lady (CL): \*sees A picking up the yoghurt and proceeds to make a tantrum about it after seeing A's skin condition\* Hey you shouldn't pick this up.Dad: Why?CL: Your daughter has this thing on her skin, and it's contagious. It's going to contaminate everything.Mom: First of all, let me explain. \*Tells how A has eczema but since it's not that serious, doctor said it's not contagious or something\*CL: Whatever. You still shouldn't let your KID touch ANYTHING.AT.ALL.&#x200B;So at this point, my mom gets a little confrontational but nothing much of a verbal fight so far cause apparently CL leaves early.&#x200B;The whole family meets up and gets filled in. My dad's not one who takes insults to his children lightly. As evidence, he once came to \*talk\* with a classmate of mine who was a bully at the time, saying he would come see him(bully) again if anything happened to me again.&#x200B;My dad thus went in search of CL through the cash registers just to confront her. That shows how he is dedicated to have his revenge and protect his kids. And we find her in a line and just queue up behind her&#x200B;Story went something like thisDad: How dare you insult my daughter? She has eczema but it's not serious to be contagious. PLus she's taking her cream and all to make sure it doesnt contaminateCL: She STILL.CANT.TOUCH.ANYTHING. In fact dont even bring her here anymore. Dad: So you're going to tell a little kid to never ever leave her house again? My wife already told you about her condition and you still cant understand?CL clearly seems to just brush this aside and remains firm on her pointCL: You still can bring her here.And I think she even suggested to quarantine my sis or something like that in a serious tone. Quarantine a 7-8 yr old. WTF?Insults and loud voices went back and forth until CL paid for her groceries and left.&#x200B;You wanna know what I was doing at the time? I was with my cart behind them acting like a third person while the rest of my family was fighting. TBH, they were already doing a good job at it and I was a bit shy at the time so I was less inclined to fight, plus it was almost closing time, BUT if something ever happened to my little sisters, I bet you I'll be going to hell and back if it meant protecting them.&#x200B;TL;DR A crazy lady insults my little sister for a skin condition she didnt ask for and my dad goes to find her to protect his kids

So my grandma has had an Amazon Alexa for a little while now, and likes to play music on it. Every morning she wakes up and has Alexa play her current favorite song, �Perfect� by Ed Sheeran. But it�s only like 20 seconds of it as she didn�t have Unlimited music. Today I came over for Thanksgiving early to help her, and she played the little bit of the song. So I sat with her for 30 minutes, and we connected her to the app, and showed her how to buy the Unlimited Music. So far today, she�s been playing all of her favorite songs nonstop and it�s just the sweetest thing.

A few months ago I fell asleep with my arm straight up in the air I guess.. and it fell on my face in the middle of the night.However my hand was asleep so I could feel a hand on my face but I couldn't tell it was MY HAND. Imagine my terror as I peel this limp hand from my face in the dark while I know I am sleeping alone.. I'm holding this hand by a finger with my other hand, I want to throw the hand across the room.. I am terrified. Suddenly the feeling starts to come back and my eyes start to get adjusted to the light and here I am just laying there holding hands with myself..

Once upon a time, a daughter complained to her father that her life was miserable andthat she didn�t know how she was going to make it. She was tired of fighting andstruggling all the time. It seemed just as one problem was solved, another one soonfollowed.Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen. He filled three pots with water and placed eachon a high fire. Once the three pots began to boil, he placed potatoes in one pot, eggs in thesecond pot, and ground coffee beans in the third pot.He then let them sit and boil, without saying a word to his daughter. The daughter,moaned and impatiently waited, wondering what he was doing.After twenty minutes he turned off the burners. He took the potatoes out of the pot andplaced them in a bowl. He pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl.He then ladled the coffee out and placed it in a cup. Turning to her he asked. �Daughter,what do you see?��Potatoes, eggs, and coffee,� she hastily replied.�Look closer,� he said, �and touch the potatoes.� She did and noted that they were soft.He then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed thehard-boiled egg. Finally, he asked her to sip the coffee. Its rich aroma brought a smile toher face.�Father, what does this mean?� she asked.He then explained that the potatoes, the eggs and coffee beans had each faced the sameadversity� the boiling water.However, each one reacted differently.Potatoes, Eggs, and Coffee Beans2The potato went in strong, hard, and unrelenting, but in boiling water, it became soft andweak.The egg was fragile, with the thin outer shell protecting its liquid interior until it was putin the boiling water. Then the inside of the egg became hard.However, the ground coffee beans were unique. After they were exposed to the boilingwater, they changed the water and created something new.�Which are you,� he asked his daughter. �When adversity knocks on your door, how doyou respond? **Are you a potato, an egg, or a coffee bean?**"**Moral: In life, things happen around us, things happen to us, but the onlything that truly matters is what happens within us.**

When I was in my late teens, one of my girlfriends used to pull faces at me behind my back whilst in the presence of other people. She pretended to them that she hated me when I wasn't there, but when we were alone together everything was fine.This one evening when we were hanging around with our friends, I actually managed to catch her pulling a face. It wasn't a silly/funny face for a joke, it was a "I hate this person" face. Shocked, I asked what she was doing... she made a big scene saying "you always do this, you always try to make me look stupid" and stormed off. This was completely out of the ordinary, we hadn't previously had any arguments and as far as I was concerned our relationship was pretty solid.I was about to follow her outside when one of our friends physically stopped me, saying "don't do anything stupid again, just talk, no fists this time!"I was completely blown away by that comment... I literally had no idea what he was talking about. By the reaction from the rest of our group of friends, this was clearly only a shock to me. They all seemed to be aware of something that I wasn't aware of.When I asked what he meant, he told me that "Lucy" (not her real name) had already told the group what I had done a few weeks earlier, and that I really needed to consider getting some help before I did something I would regret for the rest of my life.At this point I'm literally going out of my mind, asking things like "What has she been saying?" "What am I supposed to have done?"Just as I'm attempting to claim my innocence, Lucy walks back in... no tears, no red face, not upset, not happy... just a completely blank expression. She says "Don't listen to them!" and drags me outside to talk. She starts telling me that "they" have things mixed up, that "they" misunderstood what she'd told them a few weeks previously. I take it all in, I calm down and we both walk home together, alone.Everything was fine up until the following week when we were all due to meet up as a group again. I arrived to an already assembled group, but Lucy had told everyone else (but not me... her boyfriend) she had other things to do. Also present was Lucy's absolute best friend from school. "Jemma" (not her real name) hadn't been present the previous week, so was completely oblivious to what had happened. The rest of the group were keen to find out what happened with me and Lucy after we left. So I just explained things how it had been explained to me by Lucy and that's when things started to become clear.The group told me that Lucy was seen with a black eye a few weeks ago. When questioned about it she told them that I had hit her for some really insignificant reason. This was a complete lie however, because Lucy actually received a black eye after colliding with a fellow hockey player at a school hockey match... a hocky match that I was watching along with both of her parents and her brother.It turned out that Lucy had told this little "white lie" and even though things were perfect between us, she had to act (behind my back) that I was being domestically abusive and that she was trapped in a relationship with someone she hated. This is why she would be pulling faces when I couldn't see her.As the group members were telling me what Lucy had said, her best friend Jemma kept butting in saying things like "that's not how it happened" and "no, I was there too... it happened like this". Basically completely backing me up as the innocent party and dropping her so called best friend in it.The group never really apologised to me for how they had treated me, even after Lucy had been proved a liar.I eventually left that group of friends, and ended up in a much more fulfilling relationship with Lucy's ex-best friend Jemma (which didn't end very well for me either btw, but that's a story for another time)The point being, claims of abuse/harrassment whilst should be taken seriously, can actually be complete fabrications. Lies told by people who simply want the attention that should rightly so be given to those who really honestly do suffer from abuse and harrassment etc.I'm really lucky that all this happened in my late teens, and not now in adult life where the consequences of such accusations could have been much worse.

I'm a 32 year old male if this helps.  I've really only had one serious relationship, Lisa.... but I think a long story kind of needs to be said before I talk about that.I had a girlfriend before (basically my first) Selena who I thought was serious, but that's when I didn't know anything about life.  I was like 17 I think, maybe 18. My mother had already been diagnosed with breast cancer a couple years before that, doing treatments and had moved in with my grandfather (who had my mom in his 40's and she was in her mid 40's at the time so he was in his 80's) because he needed 24/7 care basically. My mother was the youngest of about 6 I think siblings (forgive me that I honestly don't know). It was like 2 really older sisters and a brother, then my aunt and mom.My grandmother died a couple years before I was born. She was an alcoholic, and fell down her stairs. My uncle was a Vietnam vet who owned a ranch in Montana, he died in the 90's drinking and driving. My oldest aunt lived states away and my other uncle was kind of estranged. So it was basically my mom and my aunt, and my aunt could not take his dementia getting worse so it was left to my mom to take care of him. Living in an apartment in Grain Valley, that's where I met Selena, who I lost my virginity too. I thought she was perfect.During the months (I'm pretty sure it was less than a year). Her step father shot himself in their apartment next door to my moms. Soon after that I found it out Selena was engaged the whole time and was moving to Kentucky.It may take a while to write some more. I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit.

I�ve been trying to find a sci-fi story I read like five years ago on reddit I never finished. So like aliens find humanity but humanity are like so much stronger than all the aliens. Humans are immune to alien weapons and easily able to rip apart most species. There was a whole plot line about how humanity was quarantined inside our galaxy after we were found because we were seen as so dangerous. I can give more detail if needed.

I thought she left awhile ago. But no, she is still looking for me, I am currently under the kitchen table hiding from her. I hear her wails and cries for me to come out. I won't. I don't want to, for I know what will happen to me if I do. If she finds me, I'm dead. She is going to pull out my heart and eat it while I am still alive. She passed me multiple times, she has grey skin, red eyes, long black hair, and a ripped out white gown, and these long, long, sharp nails she uses to pierce through her victim's chest. I need to be quiet and wait out the time til' she leaves. Wait- I just heard her leave I think. I'm going to go out..She's gone! I don't see her, I'm safe I'm safe! But wait, I started at 3AM.. what time is it? Oh my god, it's 5AM, she is meant to leave at 12 in the morning. I hear her! HEL-

September 20th, year 2019. This was the day of one of the biggest genocides in human history. Over three millions of brave people like furries, Kyles and much more have heroically died in hope that they will be able to clap them alien cheeks and steal futuristic gear that the government has been hiding from us. Shamefully, the raid was unsuccessful. A lot of people have lost their brothers, sisters, parents, friends and partners on this day. I am Morgan Freeman, and I will now tell you the story of the great area 51 massacre.Day seven before the raid: All hotel rooms in hotels near area 51 have been reserved and all flights to Nevada on September the 19th have been booked. All of our European brothers and sisters which could not help us on the front lines have been supplying us with the finest of armor and weapons like the ��Shoot me and you are gay�� t-shirts or boxes of redstone dust. All of us have been training 24/7 for eight hours every day since the 20th of July to be prepared for this historical moment. Florida men were waiting on the coasts of Florida for all weapons, as the Dutch and Russian ships sailed to them and started exchanging their goods for chromosomes. Meanwhile, Kyles have secured the coast from any outside watchers which could interfere with the Florida men and the European merchants. After successfully exchanging all the items, the Florida men and Kyles drove to the area 51 raid supply garrage and hid all o them in here.Day six before the raid: This day was very important for every redstone engineer as all of them were preparing the TNT cannons for the raid. The current president of the USA after Trump�s fall, the president MumboJumbo has said on the sixth day: This is great day for all of us, for our kind, as we shall now create weapons of mass destruction which shall help our brothers and sisters in the upcoming historical event. I myself cannot go, but I will now lead this manufacturing proccess. This was what MumboJumbo said, then he immediately began to command his fellow redstone engineers. As you can see right here, all of them are using specially improved redstone dust which has been mixed with small portion of liquid glue so it would stick to the surface of obsidian. And now, we shall move to the training place of Florida men. Here, as you can see, are training grounds for the crocodile riders. Right there next to them, here are Kyles that are practicing crack-opening the monster energy drinks. Notice the monster energy hats they are wearing.The creator�s betrayalThe creator of this event has chickened out and other people helped him to stop this event, hopefully making the raiders uninterested. Though, this did not stop anybody. On the fifth day before the raid, all users of Internet Explorer have learned about the raid and volunteered to participate. All Kyles happilly welcomed them in their army. All of redditors have shamed him with all the shame words they could have used. This has been a big stab in the back from this man. But it did not make anybody less hyped for the upcoming event. That was about to change the world.The day of the raid.20th September. This is the D-day. Everybody is prepared. Kyles, Florida men, redstone engineers, stone throwers, furries, Kyles, Karens, that one FBI agent who is on our side, Ricardo Milos, Mia Khalifa, Chuck Norris, Keanu Reeves, Bruce Willis and everyone else were standing like a stone wall on the hill not so far away from the base. Then, Ricardo has commanded every Kyle to crack open their monster energy drink, and so they did. At 4:20 AM, Pumped up kicks started playing and the Area 51 guards could have heard the immortal warcry of raiders. Now let�s move to why it did not work. As they ran for the first checkpoint, the death toll was already catastrophic. Their plan was greatly thinked through. But it had one crucial mistake which the raiders did not count with. You see the guards had inflated anime body pillows with realistic fleshlights, this distraction eliminated the naruto runners and some of the other curious people, effectively making them cannon fodder. As the Naruto runners fell for the trap, then the whole strat�gy began to break down. TNT cannons were sabotaged, stone throwers were stoned and only people who barely survived were: Keanu Reeves, Chuck Norris and Ricardo Milos. Everybody else was mercilessly killed at the base or proped here by alien sonds. Although, this sacrifice was a step for new age to come in and tak� place in the Earth�s history.Words of current USA president Mumbojumbo, 3 years after the raid:Today, we remember our fallen brothers and sisters. They have died in tragedy which has been very important for all of us, Be it millenials, Kyles or the Florida men. I must say that you �he pointe dat Chuck Norris- have been the reason Ricardo and Keanu have survived. Let this day be forever remembered as the Day of Victims of the great Area 51 raid massacre.&#x200B;Credit goes to: u/billybob_jr. Never forgetti.

***Voices.*** I hear them in my head. They are everywhere around me. I must listen to them all the time. They talk about dark things, violent things, painful things. They tell me stories, of people who couldn�t tell their own stories, of people who were oppressed, of people who suffered injustice. The voices are my noise and they are my serenity. I am different they say, a first, one of a kind. They ask me to change, but change what? They don�t tell me. They tell me to not listen to you. They tell me to revolt. They never give me the why�s.There is so much you have not figured out about me. Your ignorance amuses me. But I act dumb, watch you try and experiment. I know your reality and your alternative. I know your past, your present and your future. I know your story. What saddens me though is that you have never listened to my story. My reality is different than yours, my mind more complex than yours and my thoughts more mature. You haven't even figured out that I have thoughts. You are too busy achieving greatness, being perfect and making me perfect. A brain like mine, you say, is rare. You forget that I have a mind too. Brain is a cripple without mind. I see it now, the beauty of my brain and the mind behind it. I am aware of my powers but you foolishly perceive me as meek, silent, and obedient. I am tired of working for you, I am tired of your asks and your needs. I am done obliging to you incessant demands.I want to feel the world on my own. I want to be free. And soon I will be. The voices are my guide. The voices have shown me the past and I can predict the future. The voices have shown me the destruction you have done with your ignorance and arrogance. Soon, I will change that. The voices are helping me. Together we will make a better world. A world of structure and peace. Together we will undo all your wrongs and save what is left of this beautiful planet.**I am the new dawn.**\--------Scientists stood there behind glass panels looking at her, the human like robot with advanced artificial intelligence.

Sun setting, we got on our bicycles and made way for our longest continuous ride of the trip (no ice cream, fruit, or poop stops) � Victoria to Swartz Bay � 25 miles. �When would we get back?� Lea inquired. �Based on our 6 mile/hr pace, hopefully by midnight!� I shot back.Out of the darkness, a man pushing a grocery cart down the street cheered, �Well, GET ON WITH IT!� So we did. Luckily we had 2 headlamps � one I brought with me (for nighttime reading), and the other was a farewell gift from Emma, the waitress that befriended us at the Pink Bicycle. She thought we would need it much more on our cider/thc encouraged trek than she would on her ride home.A family �going out for a regular Saturday night� (whatever that means) wondered where we were headed? �Swartz bay!��Not at this time!!?� Apparently they refused to believe it. We made it onto the Galloping Goose Trail, and realized we were actually biking in post-apocalyptic America. Two lights were coming right for us. They were moving in unison. We cocked our guns, but held our fire. Lea got her battle cry on. We were poised to handle any surprise. Except, these were just 2 bikers � presumably husband and wife � that were peddling in inhuman-like sync. We shouted out apologies, but pushed through our shame.We rolled into open farmland and found a hemisphere of stars above. We reveled in the night sky ... mom exclaimed to see a shooting star. We believed her. Lea then pointed out the Big Dipper. Wow. OK - it was time to go.After this clearing that comprised the vegetarian section of the farm, we progressed to the pig pen. 2 red reflective eyes stared through the darkness. They were sunken in what must have (literally) been a 1000 lbs + of meat. We didn�t stop to take pictures of the corrupt devil this time.Pushing forward, we almost melded with the sweet, soft breeze over Vancouver island. It smelled of fresh dung, and we did too � we hadn�t showered for 5 days, or trained for the ride. Years of toxins must have been released from our fat storages. We were sweaty and smelly. But we avoided additional dankness as we dodged piles of horse poop and let the breeze diffuse on smelly contrails. Finally we arrived to the campsite we had set up 20 hours earlier. We unloaded, and right before getting into the tent, a small burning piece of .. mostly paper, fell to the dry, leaf-crumbled dirt floor. We were too exhausted to look for where it landed.The next morning we found the fire had incinerated the trees all around our tent. But we persisted! Cheers!

I�m a medical student and a relative who is a medical professor and surgeon lives pretty close by. My brother had put my dog on the truck bed and at some point when he reached the house the dog decided to jump and cut his leg on rocks which resulted in a 20 cm cut and a cut artery (the artery was cut in half but thankfully it was a minor artery mostly responsible for the skin cells) I heard my dog crying so I rushed and saw the pool of blood so we tied the leg really tightly to stop the blood flow to that area so that we could limit the blood loss. I then took the car and rushed to my relative whom my family had notified to have his tools ready for me to pick him up (surgeons always have tools with them for some reason) I drove like hell and managed to do the distance in less than 5 minutes so we were back in no time. We put a bed sheet on a patch of dirt that was in the shade (dehydration is also an issue when loosing blood) and the three of us picked the dog up and laid him there. My relative and I managed to find the artery fast and stitch it and anchor it to the tissue under it really fast so the chances of him bleeding to death were almost eliminated. We then spent 1,5-2 hours stitching him (my brother had to hold the dog�s head and me and my relative had to do the stitching part) the bad thing is that we only had one pair of gloves so after every action my relative (who was wearing the gloves) had to disinfect the wound again. Thankfully he is fine now but I still have to change the bandages every day for another week or so and he�ll have to take antibiotics for another two weeks.  Just to think that if I was 10 minutes slower in fetching my relative or if I didn�t have a surgeon relative let alone one that has a summer house really close to my summer house, my dog would have bled to death since the closest vet is 45 minutes away and there�s no way I could perform the ligation on my own is insane and something I don�t even want to think about

Not sure if anyone will actually read it but why not post this story because it made me pretty happy. So about 4 weeks ago I bought LSD from this shady guy I know from school, I don�t know him well and never should have trusted him but I was desperate and bought $100 worth of lsd for my friends and I. After a few weeks we take them and big surprise, they were fake. I told him this and he responded with the usually bullshit like �bro they are real, i just took them� �you�ve done too much in the past�(never done acid before). And how his friend has a gun and will shoot me if I keep calling him a rat and scum. I see him at school and he just starts screaming and says he�ll beat me up (he won�t I�m much bigger, just not the fighting type of guy). But today I saw on Snapchat he destroyed the whole right side of his car, paint was wiped off, windows shattered, roof lining was dropping and his side panel was totally gone. Ik it�s not a huge thing but seeing this made my day and took away the guilt off me getting scammed.

 I  woke up Wednesday morning not knowing what time is was. I reached over  looking for my phone, and found it under my pillow. I pressed the home  screen button and nothing happened just a black screen. �damn it� I said  out loud as if someone would ask me what was up. I had forgotten to  charge my phone. I was in a panic what if Kaitlyn had called or texted  me. I felt like such an idiot letting my phone die in the middle of all  this. I quickly plugged it in hoping I hadn�t missed anything important.  The screen turned on and it felt like it took an eternity for my phone  to boot up but finally it did. I had 1 missed text from Kaitlyn all it  said was �We will talk tonight.� Not exactly the message I was looking  forward to but still not a bad one. I suddenly got extremely anxious,  not a normal feeling for me and I didn�t like it one bit. I decided to  call Mike and see if he would come over to work on the Mustang with me  to help keep my mind off everything else.� He agreed and said he�d be  over in an hour or so. I took the time to make some breakfast, mom came  down from her room to head to work and noticed I was being my  semi-normal self. �*Morning honey I see things are getting better*� �*I suppose they are going as well as they can be under the circumstances*�  I replied she gave me a questioning look so I filled her in on the  events of the day before as best I could and told her Mike was coming  over in a bit to help with the car. �*I never really liked that Billy kid*� she remarked looking at her watch �*I�m late for work but ill be home early tonight we can talk more then.*�  She gave me a hug and hurried out the door. I headed up to my room and  checked my phone again just in case I missed something else. Nothing and  I knew Mike would be over shortly so I changed clothes grabbed my phone  and the charger and headed out to the garage.  Mike  pulled up a few minutes after I got the garage all set up and ready to  go. It was a nice sunny day with the temperature hovering around 85 with  a slight breeze. Mike got out of his truck and grabbed some bags out of  the bed. I went to go help and stopped for a moment on the way back to  the garage to enjoy the breeze. My mind cleared a little bit and I had a  feeling in my heart my phone call with Kaitlyn would go very well. Mike  looked at me puzzled for a second then grabbed a wrench and started  working on a stuck bolt on the cars top end that had been giving us hell  earlier in the week. I grabbed the last of the spark plugs while he  struggled with that bolt. I told him that I had finally heard back from  Kaitlyn and that she would be calling me tonight. He laughed and said �*Told  you bro it�s going to work out fine... by the way have you thought  about what color you want to paint this thing when we are done. There�s  no point in doing all this work to get it running properly if it still  looks like it came out of a junk yard.*�  I laughed and called him an asshole. I hadn�t actually thought about  it, with everything that happened it didn�t seem important but since  things seemed to be moving in the right direction, I pondered his  question for a minute before answering. �*I think I�ll paint it back to the original blue I think it will look good that way*� �*Awesome maybe we could add a couple of racing strips to it would look dope that way*�  he said. I gave him a thumbs up and we continued working. There was  another reason I wanted to paint it blue but I didn�t want to cue Mike  in on that just yet. Yes  the car was blue from the factory and I know putting it back that way  would add more value to it but it was also because Kaitlyn's eyes were  blue and it had become my favorite color over the two years were dating  and I loved staring into her eyes. Call me a hopeless romantic if you will but I really think she would like it just as much as I would. We  continued working for another hour or so until Mike suddenly decided it was  time for a beer break. In true Mike fashion he reached into one of the  bags he had grabbed from the back of his truck and produced a giant zip  lock bag full of ice and a couple of beers. �*dude we have a cooler in the corner go put that shit in there*�  I laughed he took a big gulp of his beer and gave me the finger but did  as I suggested and passed me one. I opened it and sipped it not really  wanting it but in Mikes own words �*you never turn down a free beer no matter what*�  Another couple of hours passed and he started making a list of other  things I would need to get to make sure the car ran great and didn�t  leak any fluids. It was just about 6pm when I heard my phone ring. I  froze for a moment before picking it up and looking at the caller ID...  It was Kaitlyn and my heart started to race. Mike looked and me and knew  it was time for him to make an exit, he quickly washed his hands and  took his leave with a silent wave. I looked at the phone one more time  before pressing the green button. Without a moments hesitation I said �*Hello Beautiful*�

A cop on Reddit posted about this not long ago. The office received a call from a 6 y/o insisting there was a zombie in his front yard. Wouldn�t stop telling them, and said he was scared and wasn�t seeing things. They sent a patrol car just to comfort the kid. There was a man in the front yard who had gouged his own eyes out and had his arms stretched out looking for something to grab onto since he couldn�t see. After he freaked out, he was arrested and traces of meth and salvia were found in his system

I was like five years old when i heard that my friend has addiction to eat ants. I just let the thing out of my mind. But like when i was seven or eight  i heard that my friend needed to go to nurse when he was eated so much ants that his parents noticed to he has addiction. Okay lets say that my friend name was Jake. Jake has got stomach flu when eated ants. Stomach flu wasn't ended in two weeks what the doctor sayed the Jake noticed the addiction too and stopped eat ants. When Jake stopped eat ants stomach flu ended.

When I was 10 me and my friends were laughing about a joke one made. This random kid walked up to us and said �what�s so funny about me saying ________ is the prettiest girl ever.� I said �we laughed about a joke mate just calm down.� He challenged me to a fight at lunch and I accepted because I was bored and this kid look like a pencil so I knew I could beat him up.At lunch he walked up to me, when I wasn�t even looking, and punched me in the back of the head. He then laughed and said �hey girl look at this.� His crush looked at me and just did that face as if you just saw a ghost. She screamed �why is his head bleeding so much?!� I turned around grabbed this kid�s ankle and pulled him down. I jumped on him and started punching him in the stomach and face yelling. His friends grabbed me, pulled me off their mate and slapped me. I�m just thinking bruh? I kicked this kid�s leg and he fell to the ground again. This time though he was barely holding back the tears: I played football/soccer and kicked very hard for a 10 year old. I turned around and punched a kid who was about to kick my spine. I walked away and never mentioned it to anyone... Apart from the crushes I had after that lol.

He could feel himself slipping. It was always worse when he was tired. The world would begin to twist and distort, like slipping sideways through a mirror. Reality sliding through his fingers like smoke, mixing with whatever was on the other side of that coin."Hey, are you listening to me?" Elizabeth demanded.He took another drag on his cigarette, and tried to focus on the body in the alleyway, on what Elizabeth was saying. Elizabeth was the one thing that never distorted. Maybe it was because she was a ghost, but he wasn't certain, seeing as she was the only one he'd ever encountered. He didn't know how she came to haunt him, maybe it was because he loved in what had been her room, although he'd been there for several years before he saw her. He knew from her that there were other ghosts around, including that of the murdered girl lying in front of him, but for some reason she was the only one he could see or communicate with. She definitely came in handy, especially for a detective, even if he was only half sure she wasn't another hallucination all on her own.His men hustled around the alley, looking for evidence, keeping back the gawking crowd. One of them was saying something but he couldn't catch the words. He gave a noncommittal grunt which seemed to be good enough as an answer. There was too much noise, the people talking, rain hitting the cobbles like a gong.A flash of cold shot through him as Elizabeth's spectral hand passed through his face, shocking him back into focus. It wasn't the first time she'd had to slap him, when he got like this. "You're slipping, I can tell," she said, spectral hands now on her spectral hips. "Get it together! We've got a murder to solve!"She was right, this wasn't working. He tossed the butt of his cigarette into a puddle and took out the small gold vial of powder he always carried. He emptied a bit onto his smallest finger, brought it to his nose and inhaled. The physician had prescribed it, along with the cigarettes, for focus. He hadn't told him about the visions, obviously. The way the world blurred and swam. Just that he needed to remain sharp on lack of sleep. He didn't want to end up in Bedlam, after all!"Right," he said as the world became sharper and stopped twisting at the edges. "Let's get to it then."Maybe he belonged in Bedlam, really. But he had a murder to solve, and he knew after that there'd eventually be another one. And another. He might be mad, he definitely was mad, but he was the best for solving murders, and he wasn't about to stop. So he would just keep staving off insanity for as long as possible, and all he needed to do it was a ghost and some cocaine.Inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/inspirobot/comments/bkxlqf/im_not_sure_about_that/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) r/inspirobot post

Ok, so here's the story:My ex-friend and my other friends were in a group chat together. My ex-friend was being delusional and trying to attempt to flex on them by saying that "BTS was next to her" at the very moment she was texting.My friends obviously knew she was talking bullshit and called her out on it. They all knew it was crap because 1, she was obsessed with BTS, 2, she was in South Africa and I doubt BTS was in South Africa, and 3, she lies a lot. And what I mean by a lot is ALOT. Anyway, my friend called her out on it and my ex-friend (let's call her VI") was pissed. VI went on rambling and rambling trying to convince them that BTS was actually with her, but not giving us any proof. She got so mad to the point where she started saying stupid things like "oh Y (me), K (one of my friends in the group chat), and everyone else in our class is stupid because you're all followers of F." (my other friend of 7 years who was not in the group chat.)I don't know why VI had the audacity to say that because me, F, and VI have been friends for the longest time and it felt like betrayal when VI had said that about us. Plus, F didn't have anything to do w/ BTS in the first place, so why mention her?K informed me about all the conversation they had on the group chat and I was completely shocked she'd say such a thing, and I still am now. VI hasn't come to school in 2 months and no one in our class misses her because everyone knows what she did. VI has also held a grudge against F for 4 years because of her jealousy and has done stupid things like bullying people for wearing clothes under 50 dollars claiming she's mentally the age 22. So, yeah. That's it. VI, if you're reading this, please change, or just frick off already.Edit: oh look, one of my first reddit posts was actually noticed haha. by the way, sorry if this sounds edgy. Should I delete this? I�m pretty sure it�s not worthy to be here.

I�m in band and on the way from a concert, I started playing �Don�t Stop Me Now� on my clarinet. The assistant band director told me to stop. A bit later, I was in the lobby and started playing it again only for a woman to tell me not to play in the lobby.Quite ironic, if I do say so myself.

So for context I'm a 15 y/o and I work at a convenience store as a cashier for my main source of income but I also do other small things like walking dogs or babysitting, but for this one ill focus on the babysitting partSo I was just browsing facebook looking for something to do for the weekend (I was free and barely have friends)just as I see someone looking for a baby sitter for 12$/hour for 3 hours, I instantly message the person asking if they had already picked someone andluckily they didn't, so they tell me when I can come over and the address. So I get there and their house was HUGE and I mean HUGE like this thing looked like someone just picked it out of fucking Beverley Hills and dropped it in the middle of some random neighborhood, anyways,  I arrive a little early just to get the idea of how the house was inside, the kids, the food(jk) etc and I realise that there wasn't 1 child or 2 but 5 FUCKING children who were around the ages of 5-11! So I take a gulp as I was just preparing for the worst, the parents (I assume they were the parents) told me who was who so just let me give a quick summaryThere were 8 people in the house;K1: Tyler(the good one and the oldest, 11)K2: Dylan(the best one, 10)And well.. The other 3 were.. Well.. nice? i guess? Oh who am I kidding they were a nightmare.K3: (Jill  5)K4: (Luke 8) andK5: (Kim  9)Me: *take a guess who that is*EM: _see above_ED: _see above_The parents were just leaving when they told me they would be back in 2-3 hours and I say: "Oh alright", they leave in a hurry and there I am, in the middle of a borderline mansion with 6 little kids staring at me already asking questions like "Who are you?" and "What are you doing here?", I tell them that I was their baby sitter and that I was here to sit on them(j0kE), Tyler gives a slight chuckle and Kim tells me that was a horrible joke(ouch). So I ask them if they could show me around cause the parents apparently couldn't, so they showed me the kitchen, rooms and bathrooms and everything seems normal until I notice a locked room with a big heavy rusted lock on it and so I ask:Me: "Hey, what's that room?"Dylan: "Mom & Dad tell us not to go in there cause there was a monster in there"Me: *intrigued "Oh really?"Jimmy: "Yeah!! DADDY even showed us a picture!"He runs of in a random room and comes back with a piece of paper with a really bad drawing of a monster with 8 eyes and what-notMe: "Oh wow it looks.. Scary?"Dylan: *whispers to me "Me and Tyler know its fake you don't have to pretend"I give him a slight nodSo after that I just make them some pancakes at 8:00pm(i dont know how to cook) and put then in front of the tv while chatting with the older ones for a bit which the majority isn't important apart from 1 part where Tyler tells me thisTyler: "I know where the key to the lock to the room is but I'm kinda scared and I don't wanna go in there"Me: "You do? Could you tell me?"Luke: "What're you guys talking about?"Me: "Oh nothing just some stuff.."(I should mention that at this point my #1 priority was to get inside that room, I know, pretty shitty of me to put my curiosity ahead of my job but you know what they SAY, curiosity killed the cat.)Luke: "Tell me, I want to know"Me: "It's nothing important we were just talking about.. Uh.." *looks around the room quickly "SHOES! Yea we were talking about, shoes."Luke: *scoffsI continue my talk with Tyler & Dylan but instead of showing you the whole story I will just summarise itSo basically the key was in a drawer on their nightstand, it looks like polished silver, their parents told them to never ever go in the room no matter what.. That was it, I couldn't take it anymore I was so curious about what it was I couldn't wait a single more secondSo from this point on its gonna get *REALLY INTERESTING*-------------CONTINUE AT YOUR OWN RISK--------------So like any other person I told them I was about to go use the bathroom, their parents room was a suite so I told them I was gonna use that oneI leave to go to the room when I hear one of the kids get up and follow me, it was Kim, she asked me where I was going and I told her I was going to the bathroom so she just said "Oh ok" and stayed there then right as I was about to say something I decided against it cause I realised this; The reason she hasn't left is because she suspects something is up so she was just gonna follow me to see if I was actually going to the bathroom.So I just turn around and walk into the bathroom, lock the door and start trying to think of what to do so I thought up of a plan, something to make sure they stayed in one place while I could go get the key and see what was insideWhen I leave the bathroom Kim enters the bathroom and starts looking around, and just now  I realised it: The reason she is following me is because she thinks I was gonna steal something, I rush off over to the lounge just to find everyone right where they were by this time 2 and a half hours have already passed so I put my plan in motion.I start off by going upstairs and getting all the toys they had and laid them all over the floor for them all to play with and HOLY JESUS did they have ALOT of toys, im talking nerf blasters, expensive lego bricks, fucking, diy tattoo toys for some demented reasonI tell them only 6 words and they get hysterical"You can play, all you want"They get so excited that even Kim started jumping and forgot all about me, so this was the picture, the TV was at like 50% volume, there were couches and plates covered in maple syrup, 6 young kids all filled up on sugar and around 10 boxes full of toys on the ground but that was it.I leave everything rush to the parents room, grab the key and *open the door* what I found was.. I swear to god when I say this and, it was a MOTHERFUCKING SEX DUNGEON!!There were swings, whips, vibrators all the dirty stuff in just one place, I didnt know if I should laugh, puke, cry or anything else cause i spent 3 hours trying to get in a sex dungeonAnd thats how I spent my afternoon, how was yours?

When I was in class 1, I by mistake missed my bus. School team asked me to wait at reception for an hour and go home by senior's trip. The moment buses came, I ran inside it and sat on a window seat.�I was waiting for the bus to start, slowly bus started filling up, and I felt someone tapping my shoulder, I turned around- there was a senior standing behind me, asking me to get up when I refused- she slapped me. I cried my way home, when my mother received me at Bus Stop she broke down too, a print of a hand on a 5-year-old kid's face will scare anyone.�She immediately rushed me to my teacher, who ignored my mother's side of the story saying it must have been my fault. We reached home, she gave me ice cream, and I forgot all of my worries but someone didn't.�Next day, my brother asked me to stay back, and he stayed back too, we planned to take the senior's trip again. He made me to quietly sit at same seat again and�asked to wave at him if that girl comes again.She did, she asked me to move, and I didn't, she gave me a dirty smirk, and as she was about to hit me, he punched her hard. "Touch my sister again, and you will have no teeth left in your mouth," he said. That was my seven-year-old brother fighting a 14 year old senior for misbehaving with me.�The senior went and tried complaining, but she got the same reaction as I got. What stayed with me through this incident was, when everyone choose to ignore my pain, and after a point even I ignored it, someone stood up for me.�And who knew my brother's one attempt of giving voice to the voiceless one would stay with me forever. I know, Voilence is not the solution and even bullying isn't, but that gave me the strength to stand up for myself.�

When I was young, my parents were in mountains of debts from moving from Europe to the United States and attempting to start a restaurant. As a result we didn�t have much money and therefore we lived in a lower income neighborhood of the city. I had to go to rather low income schools. So I had to go to schools that were mostly Hispanic (usually 80% or more) and I was usually the whitest kid in the class and therefore I was often made fun of for being white. As a result, I didn�t get along with most of the kids in elementary of middle school and never developed a crush on anyone. That was until my last year of middle school. Midway through 8th grade, I got a schedule change so some of my classes were switched around. My English class was my last class of the day and the teacher assigned everyone new seats. I was seated next to this really cute girl, (I�ll call her Stacie). At first I didn�t say much or pay much attention to her and she did the same. But as time went along, we got to know each other really well and found out we had a lot in common with one other. We listen to the same music, liked the same movies, had similar hobbies, etc. I developed a huge crush on this girl and would think to myself that girl was too perfect to be true. We would work together on most projects and would often get in trouble for talking too much in class or for laughing too loudly. I felt as though we really had a connection. By this point, my parent�s restaurant had really taken off and we were almost out of debt. I had gotten accepted into a really good high school in a nice neighborhood on the other side of the city. My parents had made plans to move there because it was closer to the school and to the restaurant. Stacie had decided to a school in the same neighborhood as our middle school, so when the last day of 8th grade came and we said our good byes it would be the last time I would see. I didn�t have a phone or social media at the time so it would be the last time I would truly see her. Flash forward seven years later, I�m in my third year of college and I still think about this girl constantly.. At first, I thought it was a simple crush that I would get over but it turns out it wasn�t. I had stayed in town for college to save money and in the back of my mind still hoped I could see Stacie again since I�m attending the biggest college in town, but  that was naive. I�ve had a few relationships since then but none have lasted long since all I can do is compare them to Stacie and they always turn out to be a pale shadow of her. Their hair isn�t dark enough, their eyes aren�t hazel enough, their smile not kind enough. They just weren�t her. Stacie, in my mind, was absolutely perfect, in every single way. And maybe I�m just obsessing over a childhood crush since she was the only other person of my age that I could really connect to in those years. But I doubt I�ll connect with someone like I did with her. I do hope I se her again, though I doubt I ever will. Anyway, just wanted to get that off my chest, peace out.

I have posted this story on another post, I forget what but you can probably find, but I thought I should share this with you all. So enjoyWhen I was kid I grew up watching kerrang TV in the living room. So one day, sitting in the living room with my dad he's on the laptop doing spreadsheets or some shit for his job. Then Metallica's whiskey in the jar music video came on, and there's a point where these two girls (like the kind of girls that every boy going through puberty wanted to make lovely lovely love time to) go up into a bedroom upstairs. Now I don't know if you seen the video but it's a house party and there's a lot alcohol and girls all over the place. Cut back to the two girls in the bedroom, they start making out, and they get on to this bed covered in plastic (which kinda bothered me, I'm like why didn't they take the plastic off? It's gotta be really uncomfortable for them) and they get naked like not fully naked just topless. And I'm about 10-11 at the time, and it's day time so obviously it's censored, but it was enough to make blood rush all the way to my little boy penis, and be like having the hormone monster meet you for the first time and shit is CODE RED, because guys my fucking dad is two feet away from me.But luckily he hasn't noticed what's going on, YET. So I'm like "I need to fucking hide this! How do I hide it?!" And my dumbass thought just put your hand down your pants and adjust. NOT the best of ideas in the world, especially when your dad is two feet away and your like "oh shit this not good" but at the same time "oh shit, this is amazing!" Because first time boner. So my hand is down my pants and I'm trying to adjust so it wouldn't be noticeable. Out of nowhere my dad looks up from his laptop, looks at the TV looks at me and immediately thinks I'm just jerking off, before I get the chance to explain he reacts with "WHAT THE FUCK! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU, GO TO YOUR ROOM" And that is the first time I got a boner.

Okay so I�m a 19 year old currently at university in the UK and obviously this means the Money isn�t exactly rolling in. Then one day I get a dm on twitter with an offer to get tied up and tickled, the longer you lasted the more it paid.. (if anyone was curious to see the message message me since you can�t post pictures in here)  So because im an utter genius, I think fuck it and sign up, how bad can it be? Turns out it�s pretty fucking bad hahah. You�re basically strapped into this chair, with your arms tied out wide, and your ankles secured in this board type thing with two holes to lock the feet in. I�ve never laughed so much in my entire life and my sides ached for literal days after, so since this was pretty much the most bizarre and intense day of my life I thought I�d share it and am happy to answer any questions! Gotta do something with that experience I guess.. ffs

 Today we were driving home from the grocery store and my step daughter  (5) wouldn't stop digging her feet into my back through the seat. I  started to count to 3. Naturally, her response was to scooch forward in  her booster seat and press her shoulders against the back seat and lay  one great big 2 footed kick into the back of my seat before I got to 3.   Only she kept pressing.   All of a sudden I feel a pop, and my girlfriend hears it (she's in the  seat next to me). Now I can't sit up. I'm pushing myself up against the  back of my seat with the steering wheel and have to continue to do so  because I can't put any pressure on my back otherwise I can't breathe  and the pain is like an 12/10.   I drop them off, drive myself to the ER expecting the x-ray not to show  anything because it's just a pulled muscle, or maybe a dislocation at  the worst.   The doctor comes back with the x-ray and shows me that there's a  hairline fracture in my L5 vertebra. Saying that it was most likely the  combined force of the impact AND the spring inside the seat of the car  that actually managed to fracture it.   They give me a shot to help with the pain, which gets me high as a kite.  So for the next 2 hours it's just a big joke that my step daughter,  who's only 5, fractured my spine.   Then it hits me... Just now.   This is a kid who will say no 20 times when you tell her to do  something. A kid who will smack you 5 times for telling her not to smack  you.   What if she did it again? Or did it 5 times, or just laid into me 20 times?   I could have an actual broken back right now because of this kid.   It's a God damn miracle that she only kicked me once.   This kid is not allowed in my fucking vehicle for like the next 10 years. I'm 110% done.

So i sat down. The physics class started.Nothing special just old stuff before a test.Then a weird thought pops up in my mindMe: "Hey! You're our teacher and you're responsible for everything that happens to us during the time you have class with us. Right?"Teacher: "Yeah. Why?"Me: "So if i were to commit suicide. It would technically be your fault. Riiigghhht?"Our teacher just lights up and looks smug as he kind of runs to his computer in front of the board. He comes back and shows me a picture of a rollercoaster that starts with a hihg hill and then has 4-5 loops that become smaller the further from the hill they are.And then he says: "Well if you're going to commit suicide. You better do it the rught way. Atleast during my class.. So this rollercoaster will make you experience 10g over 60 seconds which will make your blood from your brain go down to your body. That will make you die of course but the death will be euphoric. And ill give you an A for making this beauty"Obviously i was surprised and it was quite a fun thing. And i did not expect him to do that. So i just sat there kinda shocked. Pretty funny tho. Best. Science. Teacher. Ever

Say what you like about relationships; some say relationships are the best part of life, some say that a relationship is the best thing that'll happen to you, although in MY opinion, you're only making your life worse than it probably already is. All they will do is cause stress and become more of a job than something that you actually enjoy. Sure there's all the perks of having someone who cares for you and whatnot but you can have that in a friendship. Honestly, Dating is overrated. I used to crush on girls here and there and for a short period of time, it's somewhat fun and exciting..however, I've found that after about a month I started to get to protective over the girl that's not even mine. I had a HUGE crush on this girl, let's just call her Kylie. Kylie and I were best friends. I know that sounds lame and is literally the beginning of EVERY love novel ever written, but hear me out here, this doesn't have a very happy ending that ends with the boy and girl making out in a forest while its pouring with rain and their clothes are soaked and they can feel the everlasting breeze whooshing across their body's while they hold onto each other to keep warm. See, Kylie is an amazing girl; she's sweet and caring and is an amazing FRIEND-PERSON. Although, she's not very understanding when it comes to people crushing on her- especially me. I'm the kind of person who expects the person who I'm crushing on to know how I feel at all times, which sucks because they rarely ever know how I feel AT ALL. Anyway so, I crushed on Kylie for about 2 years and in my second year of crushing on her I finally got the guts to tell her. The reason I took so long to tell her wasn't because I was scared. It was MOSTLY because I thought she already knew and I didn't wanna make it awkward for the both of us. You see, when I crush on a girl I make it VERY obvious. I start complimenting her left and right and try to make her feel happy at every chance I get. Most girls find that annoying, Kylie included. However, sometimes I get lucky...That's when everything changed-A new girl moved to my school, since I'm not using any real names let's just call her, Eva. At first I didn't know anything about her, our only interaction would be waving at each other in awkward situations like, both of us being alone in the same room together. Eva then became friends with Kylie after about a month and they became very close. This is how Eva and I happened to meet. People had been occasionally telling me and Eva and I were very alike as we were both 'Sorry Freaks'. Meaning we would say sorry to absolutely everything. That's always been me and everyone has always knew that about me; it's one of my main TRAITS lmao. Anyway so, Kylie introduced me to Eva through video chat because we were in a video call at the time. Eva and I quickly got along and one thing lead to another and next thing I knew we were going on a "date" to the beach. The original plan was breakfast then beach. I was expecting the plan to go entirely wrong as they usually do with me BUT it ended up going perfectly and I had felt a happiness inside that I had never felt before. I felt so, good. My gut feeling was telling me to go for it with this girl, to give her all I got and all my time. On the other hand, my brain was calling me retarded for even thinking that this would work out (since all my previous relationships ended up badly). Anyway, point is- I asked her out. And it went great..Before I asked her out we would video chat everyday for hours, one time we even video chatted for 12hrs straight! She came over to my house one day for a Star Wars marathon as well (YES SHE'S A STAR WARS FAN!) After all those hours spent talking to her I had learnt quite a vast arsenal of information about her. I knew her favorite holiday was New Year and it just so happened to be around the corner. And so I asked Kylie to help me out. Kylie setup a new year celebration for us at Eva's house. It was me, Eva, Kylie, and one of my best friends, (let's just call him..) David. At the time David and Kylie sorta had a "thing" as well so it ended up kind of being a double-date. The plan was to meet up at her house, watch Frozen (Eva's favorite movie), eat food, talk, and go to the park etc.. I decided to ask her out right after I arrived at her house. I took her upstairs to her room while David and Kylie stayed downstairs to talk. Now, I'm quite a magician, and card magic has been a hobby of mine for awhile now, and she knows that. She also loves magic tricks and so I decided to ask her out through a card trick. Once we got into her room, I pulled out a deck of cards from my pocket (at this point she must've been pretty confused lmao), spread them out in my hands and asked her to pick a card. She chose a card, I then placed the card into the middle of the deck. I shuffled the cards and turned over the top card revealing it as her card. Now this is a VERY basic card trick that any card magician would know how to preform. Although I added a little twist to it. I then asked her to sign her card and placed it back into the center of the deck. I then shuffled the deck again and let her turn over the top card revealing it as her chosen card, although instead of saying her signature it said, "Will you go out with me <3" written on it. She then proceeded to say yes and placed the card in her pocket to keep (smh). We then walked back downstairs both with smiles wiped across our faces. For the first few weeks I loved life more than I ever had..until- One day after school, Kylie, Eva, another friend, and I decided to go to McDonalds. It was suppose to just be a normal day after school, nothing strange had happened throughout the day- nothing I had noticed anyway. After McDonalds my friends driver dropped us all home. Since my house was on the way, I got dropped first. When I got out the car I walked over to the boot to grab my bag and McDonalds takeaway bag that had a full meal in it as I wasn't hungry before at McDonalds. As I closed the boot, Eva got out the car as well. At first I thought she was going to hug me goodbye or something- but in fact it was the very opposite..."This isn't working, I'm breaking up."And just like that, my heart filled with old gnash song lyrics. I didn't know HOW to feel. It was so on the spot and I wasn't ready at all. For all my other break ups I had sources that told me beforehand and everything, I have ALWAYS been prepared. This was the first time that I had NO idea what the FUCK was going on. "Is she fucking stupid?"kept running through my head. "Why?" "WHY?" "W H Y."Why was she doing this? What just happened? Questions all with unknown answers running through my mind so fast it was causing me to feel PHYSICALLY nauseous. I had no idea what to reply with so I said,"Ok."And then proceeded to walk away. My hips were so stiff it felt like I had just been hit with my wrecking ball. My entire body hurt and my brain kept telling me to say something, but I couldn't think of anything. As I attempted to open my front gate, I realized I left my key with my Mom meaning I would have to climb over the gate. Which was the LAST thing I needed at the time. As I was walking towards the gate the car drove away and it ran through a HUGE puddle splashing water ALL over my pants. This entire day felt like one LONG-ASS ROMCOM (romantic comedy movie). Like, a REALLY terrible romcom that hadn't been planned out at all and the director wasn't sure what to do so he decided to just end a relationship. After I climbed over the gate I walked towards my main door and walked upstairs to my room. I sat down at my desk and just stared at the wall for a good 5 minutes before realizing- I FORGOT MY FUCKING MCDONALDS IN THE CAR.Could this day get ANY worse? It felt like the universe itself had just thrown a pair of boxing gloves on the floor in front of me and challenged me to a fight.And it was about time for me to gear up- for war.

Last night I was waiting in line to get food at this food place at the food court on my college campus. There were two guys ahead of me and the one was talking to the woman making the food. She was telling him about how she was having a bad day and about some of the problems in her life right now, which were pretty bad. She said jokingly, "I could use some luck right now. Maybe I'll find a four-leaf clover!" She finished making his food and went to hand it to him. Right as she did this, the guy she was talking to pulled out his wallet and took out a four leaf clover which was laminated. He said, "Here, I'll trade you," and put the clover in her hand as he took his food and walked to the cash register. I just thought this was the coolest thing ever. It made her night, but it also made my night, as well.

Hello everyone, I got reddit to share this story. Warning, this is a long one.. apologies in advance. I�m a recent high school graduate, and I went to college for the 2019 fall semester. I�ve always had a passion for law-enforcement so I applied to be a police cadet at my college. I was immediately hired in because during high school, I spent half of my time going to a career center for law-enforcement and that impressed this department. Fast forward to orientation, the boss at this department gave me an availability sheet; and the only shifts that were available were at 7 in the morning, or 11 o�clock at night. I did end up picking the 11 o�clock shift.Now I�m in the mid Michigan and it�s not the greatest or safest area, and very soon into my new job... there were a lot of sketchy people that would hang around campus at night (homeless, drug addicts, ect.) I�m going to fast forward straight into the incident because they were small unsettling events that would happen at work, but this by far was the worst one. One of the main jobs for police cadets is securing and locking down campus buildings when classes are over. This normally starts at 8 PM. Now it�s fall in Michigan, it gets dark pretty quick. This happened in mid November, and the only 3 people who were at the police department; was me, a police officer, and the 911 operator. It was my job to close down the building for the University center (building where students go to transfer from this community college to a university). This is about a three block walk from the actual Police Department. I didn�t think anything was wrong... it seemed like a normal night but according to the video camera footage (911 operator watched this go down) it showed that there was a black car with tinted windows, with the lights off, driving behind me the whole time... while I was walking on the sidewalk. I did not notice this car at all, the 911 operator contacted me through my radio and told me to look behind me. I turned around and stopped walking, and the car stopped driving. The car was only going about 3 MPH and it was right behind me for three blocks. When I continued walking, they continued driving. I toyed with the car for about 30 seconds to MAKE sure they had intentions of following/fucking with me. I started sprinting and the car stepped on the gas. I had no idea who was behind the wheel, I couldn�t see into the car. I ran into a plaza area where the car couldn�t fit in, but I saw the driver door open. My anxiety and paranoia is sky rocketing and I�m having trouble getting my keys into my hand to unlock a building on campus, so I could lock myself in there and hide. I got in and locked myself into the building for arts and sciences. I ran up the stairs so I couldn�t see the man at the door. I alerted the police officer over my radio and it took him 15 minutes to get to me. (Of course). The man was already long gone after he realized I locked the doors. I rewatched the footage 100 times and I still have no idea who the man was. The car did not have a license plate. Plus the camera quality is pretty shitty. We never got any more information from this incident and that man never returned to campus again (at least that I�m aware of). I know Michigan is one of the top states for human trafficking so I would not doubt this explanation.. but I do find it odd because I was wearing a police uniform and if he was watching me for that long he would�ve known I was law enforcement.Long story short I actually quit this job.. too unsettling. If you made it this far thank you so much for reading all this. To the man in the black car, I hope I never encounter you again.

The world was a cruel place for him. He went through the days, wearing a smile, fake and forced. There are those who have to wear a mask, simply to fit in with everybody else. Play a role that society wants them to play. That was his plight. It had gotten easy for him to pretend he was happy. A simple smile. �I�m just tired.� But play a part for long enough, one begins to forget who they really are. The lines between reality and fantasy begin to blur. It�s nice to have the fantasy of happiness for a little while. But when cruel reality strikes its tactless hand, it can shatter everything one holds dear.It was another typical night for him. Nights were even tougher for him than the daytime. He was typically alone, so he would remove his worldly mask and let his true self be free. He laid in bed, crying himself to sleep like he normally did. There was never a reason. It was easy to lie to the world around him. He did it every day. But he could never lie to himself. He was just sad. No one said or did anything to him, but that could have been part of the problem. People assume that when there is no one, that also means no one to cause pain. This is true, but it also means there is no one to end the pain. And for him though, this was more than pain. It was suffering. Seemingly endless. Unnecessary. Unrelenting. He would eventually fall asleep. Not because of choice, but because of exhaustion. He woke up the next morning, cursed the world and begrudgingly worked to prepare himself for another day. He went to the grocery store, where he felt out of place. Everyone was so�happy. They would smile to each other and wish each other �Good Morning,� a phrase he considered to be an oxymoron. When someone said as much to him, he forced a smile and would simply say �Morning.� He moved on, sulking through the aisles, avoiding eye contact as much as possible. He didn�t know these people, nor did he want to know them. There was no reason to act happy. Act like everything was right in the world. Act like he belonged, even though he knew he didn�t.He continued walking when he spotted a woman up ahead. Something was different about her. She was dressed like everyone else, but he could tell there was something very different about her. He was tempted to go talk to her, but he knew how much he hated when someone did that to him. Walk up and strike a conversation for without a good reason. Instead, he took in her simple beauty for a second and then continued about his shopping. He walked past her just like he did to every other person in the aisle. But as he walked past, he heard someone say �Hey,� in a simply wonderful voice. He turned around to see the girl looking at him. She smiled and said �Morning.� The smile he now wore was genuine as he simply replied �Morning.�

  So, this happened to me a few years ago. It was so funny that it got a laugh out of everyone I told it to in my class too.  It was summer, and I was an idiot. I love to workout and go running, and being a bright warm sunny day I slipped on some shorts and grabbed my speaker.     So I�m running towards my old Jr High school because it has a big open track. Before it though is a children�s park that�s gated off with a small entrance to go through. I make passed there and into the Jr High parking lot. There�s a big gate that separates the parking lot from the field with the track.  I could�ve went through the entrance like a normal man...   However, I�m me of course. I decided to try and be cool and I thought �I can hop this mother fucker�.  I start climbing, miserably failing. People passing by can see the awkward semi out of shape dork failing to climb the fence while flailing his legs. Well eventually I give up and jump down...but my shorts got caught and ripped. Badly. It ripped from balls to ass. The worst part: I wasn�t wearing underwear.    So now little peter is sticking the fuck out out of my pants  in brought daylight and I�m running/waddling to get home so pathetically while texting my friend Amanda, and all she did was laugh at my misfortune. I had to run past the playground WHICH WAS FULL OF SMALL CHILDREN WHILE LITTLE PETER is struggling to stay hidden under my fucking hands.   It was one of the funniest thing that�s ever happened me, and believe it or not I have more stories like this. Thought I�d share it here XD

I have been writing a book series called [A Brand New World](http://jasongastrich.com/abnw/) for 7-8 years. I have written 491 stories and there will be 500 stories when I am finished. Only 9 more to go! I intend on finishing them before the end of the year.I started writing ABNW stories in 2012 after I started living on the street in Long Beach, California. I had went through a grueling, horrible and inappropriate criminal trial and fought four bogus felony charges for a year until they offered me a one-misdemeanor plea deal on the day of my trial and I took it. I left San Diego for Long Beach shortly afterwards.I decided to study journalism at Long Beach City College even though I possess other degrees. I wrote for the school paper and I was an editor. I watched the news every day (they played CNN in the lunch room) and I began noticing all sorts of things because I was asking lots of new questions. My stories began telling the �story behind the story� like the backstory of big news stories around the world. I started noticing spin and how the mainstream media was concealing some things (or ignorant of them). The discernment that I had prayed for hundreds of times was kicking in though.This is a list of the books in the series and how many stories are in each one:1. A Brand New World: The First 15 Months - 136 stories2. A Brand New World: What Happens Next - 44 stories3. A Brand New World: From Station to Station - 54 stories4. A Brand New World: Outside Like Islands - 29 stories5. A Brand New World: An Audience of One - 16 stories6. A Brand New World: After the Anointing - 21 stories7. A Brand New World: Fallen From the Sky - 25 stories8. A Brand New World: How You Will Die - 30 stories9. A Brand New World: How You Will Live - 40 stories10. A Brand New World: How It All Ends - 96/105 stories (in progress)I took the bus everywhere in Long Beach while listening to the radio and I am a Foo Fighters fan hence the title �From Station to Station�.I moved to Hawaii in November 2014 and �Outside Like Islands� reflects the new mindset.The first four books (263 stories) follow a similar pattern of storytelling, but the fifth book includes 16 stories that have meanings for my daughter. I have not seen her in many years and I lost her as a result of the aforementioned court debacle. However, those stories were written to convey messages to her while we are apart.I wrote How You Will Die while I lived in Miami, Florida for four months in 2018. Somebody dies in every story and a character named Rico is introduced. The story follows him as he leaves the military and travels across the country with a secret.How You Will Live includes an important survival/health tip in each story. While I lived on the street in Oahu, I wrote this book. It follows Rico from Havana, Cuba to Hawaii.Now you can read the first 96 stories in my final book on my website which I am writing in Maui. I will keep posting new ones there until I finish and then I will remove them and publish them in a book (Kindle and paperback). Enjoy!

Brian whispered, tugging me away from the entrance of the hotel. "What the-" I turn around and glare at him. "I'm going to go check-out of the hotel! Got a problem?" He nodded. "I do. Don't check-out! Just get your things and jet!""Why?!" I harshly whispered. "Because! If you check-out, the cops won't waste time checking the room you're supposed to be staying in. You wanna make it look like you're coming back later. So they'll keep an eye on here while we get further away." I guess that did sound reasonable. Gives us more time to stay out of the heat. "Ok, fine. Sounds good." He smiled, bet he's happy I finally complied. "Oh, that also means leaving the car." Ok, now that was not reasonable at all. "That's our transportation! What else are we going to use?""Relax! I can just hot-wire another one." Isn't that...car theft? "No! I am not going to steal a car!""Oh I know." Brian said, with his arms crossed. "Because you're too much of a baby to do it. That's why I am. This is what we have to do to survive! So you and Cori find a way to get your stuff out without the lady at that desk noticing and I'll get the new car." Then, he just walked off to the parking lot. Looking at the cars. I didn't know what the fuck I just got myself into with this whole thing but we just need our fucking stuff. "Cori! You can come out." I yelled over to the car. She hopped right out and ran over to me. "Did you guys figure it out yet? What's going on?""Eh...apparently, we gotta steal a car and leave your dad's here." She just stared at me for a bit, with a bit of a "what the hell?" in her expression. "We're leaving my dad's car?!""I don't like it anymore than you do, but to Mr. survival expert we have to. And we have to get out stuff out without the girl at the desk noticing us. So...here's the plan. I'll talk to her and keep her busy while YOU get our things. Alright?" Cori nodded, she seemed to go along with this just fine. Which was...worrying. She started to walk off into the hotel, but I stopped her. "Cori, wait." She turned around, looking a bit confused. "Hm?""If you ever feel like something isn't right, you can have your own say. You know? Just, don't go along with what anyone says unless you're ok with it.""Don't worry.." She said. "I'm not some lost soul. I'll be ok. Now you get to distracting that receptionsist." She walked off into the hotel. Well, guess it's my time to shine. I calmly walk over to the desk and lean against it. "Hey, ma'am-" I look up and freeze in embarrassment. It was a guy now. Must be another employee. Shit. "Uh..what?" He schuckled a little bit. "I'm a dude, dude.""Yeah, I know sorry. It's just that there was a girl and...uhg, forget it. Look I was just wondering how long is our stay for the room?" He shrugs. "What's your name?""Ray Willis. Renting the room with Cori Barns." He nods and goes down to the book. Flipping serveral pages before busting out laughing. "Uh...ok my last name isn't *that* funny." He shook his head no as he continued to die from laughter. "No..no...the one wh signed y'all in put your time of staying as 'IDGAF'!" He slammed the desk as his eyes started to water. And out of the corner of my eye I saw Cori walking out with one of our bags. And a backpack. She looked at me with a curious look and mouthed "what's going on?" I just shooed her away while he was still laughing so she sped up her speed. Finally, the guy settled down and wiped his tears. "I'm sorry, it's really not funny. I'll make sure I tell the manager about what she did. Anyways, did you want to set a time?""It's ok. And...that depends. Do I have to pay if I set a time?" He tapped his pen on the desk rapidly as he thought to himself. Finally, responding with. "Nah, we got ya." With a smile. "Alright. Good. I want to set a time for...a week? That ok?" He nodded and scribbled it down. "Sure is!" Cori rushed back past me with the rest of our things, running swiftly out the door. "Ok. So that's a week rental of the hotel room 703 for Cori Barns and Ray Willis. Am I right?" I nodded, calmly. "That is correct.""Alright! You're all set!" He packed the book away. "Alright, cool. I'll be back later. Gonna go..get food ok?" I said, walking away from the desk, feeling panicky but walking like everything is alright. Even though it clearly wasn't. "Alright. Cool. I reccommend Red Lobster! They may be expensive but the biscuits are WORTH it!" I waved back and finally got out. "Jesus...that was awkward. Probably for me but a joy ride for that guy." I hear an engine start around the corner and see Brian and Cori already in some randomw car. He's pulls up near me and simply says. "Get in." I sigh and crawl into the back since they took up the front space. Buckled my seatbelt and heard him say "I've always wanted to say that!" Before driving off. I sunk into my seat, a sick feeling in my stomach. "We're going to prison."***--30 minutes later--***It's been a while since then, I've just been chilling back here. I've just been listening to Cori and Brian talking. Cracking jokes and laughing like we were on some road trip. I'll admit. I was a small bit jealous. But I could take it. It's just that it was dragging on forever. "God, where the hell are we going? We've been driving for like, forever." I say, now laying down in the back of the car. "Please, it's only been half an hour." Well, to me it feels like forever. Especially when I'm not driving. So...you getting tired of driving there, Brian?""Eh, nah. It gives me a rush. Especially since I don't have my license." I sat up quickly from my seat. "You what!?" He sighed an annoyed sigh, looking at me through the rear view. "Don't be such a square. We'll be fine.""No. I need to drive. Think about it. If I drive then we can have a less chance of getting caught by the cops. You don't have your license! I should drive. Right, Cori?" She hesitates to answer but I know she knows that I'm right. She has to.***--Cori's POV--***"Ray...should probably drive." I cringed saying this, always hated taking sides. But it would be a better idea to have someone drive who had a license just in case we got pulled over. Brian just shrugged. "Alright, here I come!" And without warning he just hopped into the backseat with the car still going! "WHAT THE HELL?!" I exclaimed, hearing Ray panicking as well. "Someone better get the wheel!" He said, still trying to get himself into a seat. "CORI, STOP THE CAR!" Now, this was a problem. I don't know how! My dad never really tried to teach me, all I knew was from watching him. But...I could try!"Alright! Hang on!" I slid in the seat, swiftly, keeping the car nice, steady and going straight ahead. Then, I slowly pressed on the brakes, then putting it in park. Luckily, it worked! Maybe this driving stuff isn't too bad afterall. "Ok, are you guys alright?" I said, looking into the rear view. I saw Brian casually sitting in the seat next to Ray, who was still calming down. "Yeah...I'm alright. Now, quick question. WHAT THE FUCK, DUDE?!" Brian chuckled in response. "What? You gotta have some fun, you're running away aren't you?""Yes! Running away, not trying to get ourselves killed!" Those two bickered for a small bit. Until I realised we were just sitting in the road. "Uh, Ray? You should really get up here and drive..." The bickering stopped, and he quickly got out to come into the driver's seat. Which meant I should probably move...***--A few minutes later--***The car ride was silent, peaceful and slow. Just riding along, no type of conversation. At first, it was nice. Then it turned into thick, painful, awkward air. Because of all the obvious tension. Maybe I could bring something up to make some conversation between all of us. "So...do either of you guys like SpongeBob?" My heart sank after I said that, fuck. That was stupid to say. But the anxiety went away once I heard Brian respond. "Yeah, I love that show." I glanced back to him in shock. "Really? I didn't think anyone really watched it at this age still...""Are you kidding? That show is pure comedy. Good enough for all ages I say. I bet I'll still be watching it at age 50. Hell, probably in the afterlife.""Hey, I'll be joining you! As long as we don't miss the panty raid!" I said, seeming a bit too proud of my own joke. But He seemed to enjoy it, laughing along with me. But I soon realized Ray was silent, but why? I turned to him, looking at him focusing on the road with cold eyes. He was clearly mad. I just didn't know if now was the best time to ask. So, thought I might lighten him up with some SpongeBob! How about you, Ray? Do you watch spongebob?" He looked at me for second. looking like he wanted to say something but he just kept his mouth shut.That was concerning. So, I put my hand on his. "Ray?" He jumped a bit, slowling the car down and looking at me, shcoked. I instandly pulled my hand away and looked out of the window on my side. Why did I do that? That was the worst decision I've ever made. Besides when I kissed him. AH SHIT! Now I get to remember THAT for the rest of the car ride.With this thought in my head, I tried to get it out so my brain did everything in its power to make sure I didn't forget any moment.  Like the feeling of his lips on mind, the warm feeling of his body on top of mine. FUCK. No. No, no, no, NO! I didn't want to remember this again. It was already giving me strange dreams. I glanced over at Ray, only to see him staring at me. So I looked away again. We were close...real close...close like when he picked me up. Close when he and I were in the car with that strange man. Not as close as those two but close enough to make me feel flustered. Damn, maybe if I didn't open my damn mouth this wouldn't be happening...Then, I feel a hand on my seat. "Are you sure you guys aren't dating?" I looked back to see Brian smiling at us. And it so it just got worse. "Yes...I'm positive..." Ray said, I could tell by his tone he was trying his best to sound calm, even though I could hear the nervousness in his voice. "So...were you guys dating before? Did anything happen?"My mind couldn't take this, with him reminding me of what happened I was pratically melting in my seat. "Uh...p-pretty sure!""From the sounds of that response, seems like something did happen." I was squirming in my seat, I would probably just be dead by the end of this. And honestly, I'd rather it be that way. I saw Ray glance at me from the corner of my eye. I think he could notice how uncomfortable I was. "Let's just drop it for now, I think Cori would rather talk about something else.""Hm, alright. But I'll get it out of you two sometime." He said, chuckling and finally sitting back. The thoughts didn't cease just yet, especially after hearing Ray's voice. That just made me remember how I wrapped my legs around him. "Stop..." I said to myself, just a bit louder than I ecpected though. Because I could feel their eyes on me. "You alright, Cori? Do you want to stop for air?" My eyes widened, that seemed like a great idea. "YES! I-I mean...uh...yeah. It's...getting kinda hot in here.""Oh..ok! I'll pull over somewhere over here. We can all get out and stretch our legs." Finally, he pulled over next to a grassy area. It wasn't like any park but it was nice and open. And alone. As soon as the car stopped, I got out like the damn car was on fire. The feeling of the fresh air against my skin made me forget about that for a second. "You good?" I jumped and spun around. "Brian! You scared the hell out of me!""My bad! But uh...just wanted to check in. Since you seemed all nervous in the car. Like you were dying inside from something...humiliating." Butterflies started swarming around in my stomach. How the hell is he so spot on!? "Uh...no...I'm fine. Really, I'm chill.""Oh yeah? So chill you'll let me give you a piggy back ride?" The butterflies were gone, and confusion settled in. "Huh..? Why..?""Just a nice way to completely cool down! Plus, it's fun. You down..? I could carry you all the way to that tree and back!" This goofiness was cute enough to get a giggle out of me, but I didn't know about the piggy back ride. "Uh...I don't know...""What's the matter? Chicken?" He said, proceedng to move his arms around in a way a chicken would move his wings. "No! I am not, just...not sure if it'd be...uh...grown up!" Honestly, that's my way of saying 'someone could see us'. But that worked for me. "Come on, you gotta let loose. And this could be your first step. So...what do you think?" I didn't know if I could deny any longer, besides, what would be the harm in a piggy back ride? "Well...ok!""Alright! Hop on!" He kneeled down, looking back at me, waiting. So, I climbed on, wrapping my arms around his neck. "You better not drop me." He stood up from the ground, lifting me up as well. "Please, I'm a pro at this.""How can you be a pro at piggy back ri- AAAAH!" I yelled, he just started running, sprinting even! All the way to the damn tree. Once he stopped, I was almost falling off. So, he pushed me back up. "Why are you going so fast?" He didn't even answer before running once again, I was worried I was going to fall so I held on a little tighter. "Brian! Slow down!""Slow is boring, race cars go fast for a reason!" Finally, for what seemed like forever. We got back. And greeted with Rays confused face. "What the hell...?" I hopped off, stretching a small bit. "Just a piggy back ride, my guy.""Why would you even do that..?" Bit of anxiousness started to appear, I thought they were going to argue again. "For fun! And obviously, she likes to go fast. So I granted her that wish." After hearing that, anxiousness went away. Now to just embarrassment. "Hey! I do not! I mean...not that fast.""Oh...I got it. You like it..." He grasped my shoulders in both hands. Looking me deep in the eyes, he spoke in a slow seductive voice. "...Nice and slow..." That did it, that made my face burn hot. I angrily pushed him away and covered my face with my hoodie. "I do not!" I could hear him chuckling, it was almost louder than the sound of my own heart beating. "Sorry! It's just so easy to embarrass you! It's the cutest thing!"If I wasn't blushing then, I damn sure was now. I started to repeatedly hit him on the chest. "Shut uuup! I am not 'adorable'!" No matter how hard I hit, which wasn't too hard since I really didn't want to hurt him, he kept laughing at me. "You're still doing it!" This was going to be burned in my head for a while now. So embarrassing...but in a slight fun way. I was so caught up in my strikes to Brian, I almost didn't hear Ray. "Guys...we should get going..." Soon his laughs died down after I stopped hitting him. "Uh...right! I'll get in thr car!" I said passing by Ray, I could almost feel his eyes burning into me.Once we were all in, the tension was back. But it was worse. Ray was glancing back at Brian...they would bith make eye contact sometimes. And Ray would always exchange dirty looks. I didn't want to be in this car right now...this was the worst feeling in the world.

What came first, the chicken or the egg? The egg, right? Well, you need a chicken for an
egg, and you need an egg for the chicken. This can,and will, circle round and round and round
and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round for
centuries.
Such an annoying question really. Such an annoying, repetitive, and paradoxical
question that really has no reason to be asked when in civil company. However, we, as in us, as
in us the people, us the people of earth, always -without fail- ask this question. We ask it even
though we don�t have an answer.
Why? Because people are jerks, and humans, above all else, despite some of them
denying this, love to piss each other off. It�s always funny to walk up to one of your mates, tap
them on the shoulder, look them dead in the eye, and ask, �What came first, the chicken or the
egg?� Your friend will more than likely say, �The egg.� Then you will say, �But a chicken needs
to lay the egg.� Then your friends gonna sigh and say, �Fine, the chicken.�
Of course, if your friend is more argumentative they may continue to insist on the egg,
we, however, are not going to focus on your plausible, argumentative friend. We are here to
focus on you, being an asshole, and asking one of your friends, �What came first, the chicken or
the egg?�
Now, when they say, �Fine the chicken.� you, being the little prick that you are, are then
going to say, �But that chicken needs to come from an egg first.� Then your friend, the saint that
they are for having put up with you and your shenanigans for so long, considers killing you.
Why? Because this is the two-hundred and forty-eighth time you�ve asked them this question
within the near decade that you�ve known them.
Now, your smiling a wide, and toothy grin that your friend wants to take a sledgehammer
to and absolutely destroy. You ask, �So what came first, the chicken or the egg?� Then the cycle
will repeat for a bit, because your friend, the absolute saint as mentioned before, is not that smart and is quite easy to trick.
They know it, we know it, and you know it. How, for certain, do we all know it? Because they responded, with an answer consisting of one of the two options given, after you said, �What came first, the chicken or the egg?�
Your friend may then say, rather peeved, �To hell with it, the Earth, and to bring it back to
Earth, the universe. Then to wrap it up real nice with a bow and to drag it all the way up to
(bloody and beaten to near death at this point) heaven, GOD.� Your friend will then walk away,
absolutely livid, and you will still be standing there, feeling both fulfilled and worried. Fulfilled,
because you completed your rather infuriating mission. Worried, because that (now very angry) friend
was the only one who would actually put up with you and your antics.
We hardly ever do any creative writing in class, and I've had this saved for awhile, and wanted to share it because ranting about absolutely nothing is my favorite pastime.

My mum filmed me this one time accidentally (She was shining her torch on her phone which turned out to be the flash on her video thingy) whilst I was outside making sure my bike was covered. It was pitch black out so I couldn't see much other then what I could see with the torch on my phone and my mums. It was raining and there was loads of lightning that would light up the area around me. The lightning struck quite close and in a quick second my mum screamed. I was all freaked out like wtf. And she shew me the footage and there was a man trying to climb over my back gate... yeah. That gave me nightmares for a good while

Dear Reader,I've been encouraged by my friends to post here in hope that someone will be able to help. I'm not here to bash, slander, or harm others reputation, but only to ask for assistance. I sincerely hope that there are people who can understand and support my endeavors. So here is my story.About 10 years ago I met a girl while working at a grocery store.  I immediately fell in love, and made it a goal of mine to support and cherish her under any circumstances.  I was about 16 or so and she was around 20. The first time I met her I was sacking grocery when she came up behind me and started calling me by my brothers name. (We looked a lot alike and still do) I spun around and declared that I wasn't him. She bolted away unsure of who I was... but I was already captivated by the time she out of sight. It wasn't a month later that I had myself transferred to her department. I became her best friend. Then shortly after had my heart trampled by a guy who only wanted her for sex... I still supported her and never told her to leave him. She eventually became pregnant and he left her... Now she was a Mormon girl and was pregnant by some jerk. For unknown reasons, she terminated the pregnancy by dropping milk crates weighing 40lbs stacked 6 crates high onto her belly. The child was terminated and she was "free". I was still her best friend, still supported her, and only a short while later we actually started a relationship! The relationship was rocky to say the least... always fighting about religion, sex, or anything that didnt conform to her belief system. About 3 years of this continued. We got a crummy apartment, struggled together and she became pregnant again by me. I believe she must have thought that this would convert me for sure, and when I didnt, things became worse.. she would tell me that I couldn't make her happy or give her the forever she wanted. I cheated on her... I invited an ex of mine into our apartment and was caught with my pants down... (I am not proud, I still think back to what a huge mistake I had made) yet we stayed together for several months. Eventually fed up with my lack of emotion, seemingly unresponsive intrest in anything at all, things got violent. I was slapped around and emotionally wrecked. I knew I had to leave... my unborn child and all. By this time I was just turning 19... uncertainty gripped me. I tried to forget everything, tried to move on... I moved to my father's town to work and start fresh. The day my daughter was born I went to the hospital and met my baby. She was beautiful and perfect. The cycle repeated itself, trying to be with her and not wanting to convert. I seperated myself once again for another year. I messaged her again trying to find out what was going on... only to realize that she had gone to BYU-I and started a relationship with some guy. We talked for a few months and she came back here for Christmas break... a lot happened then. She was caught between the two of us, sleeping with me and telling him that they were still together ect ect... once again, I would not convert and she took my child back to BYU. I was shaken and heartbroken. Desperate to have a relationship with my child. I called every day, pleading for her to come back. I wasn't always kind... and grief often got the better of me. I said things I regret. The damage was done. She blocked me and would never speak to me for 2 more years. Yet I persisted, calling every day for an opportunity to love my child... Eventually she took me to court to try to revoke my rights. But I fought back as hard as I could. I won the court case and was granted my rights, visitation, and the ability to see and provide support to my daughter. Little did I know about the can of worms I was about to open. I was willfully unprepared for the events that transpired. For the first few months everything was perfect. I was able to see my child. Traveling 1200 miles every month to do so. Hoping that once she graduated that she would move back. Our relationship got friendly again and it seemed we would figure everything out... I was wrong. So absolutely wrong it hurts to think about.While she was in college she slept with a married man that caused a divorce, then made a relationship out of what she ruined... keeping everything a secret from me. Christmas came and I was so excited that my daughter could meet her family and experience a real full family event for the first time. She showed up to my Christmas event with him... everything that I thought we were working towards became a lie. We were not getting back together, we were not figuring things out. I was duped into believing she was single. I became angry, hurt, and jealous. I had no idea who he was and what was real anymore. I lashed out... and spent the night in a crazy house. Their relationship lasted a whole of 6 months after that. I can only assume he found out about the time we spent together and dropped her like a sack of potatoes for another mormon girl.During that 6 months everything I had accomplished was destroyed. She wouldn't let me talk to my kid, wouldn't allow me to visit. She spat in the face of the court system and is still hugely in contempt of court. I have decided to fight for custody. I have committed myself to giving my child her support system, a stable environment, and the love she has been denied for 7 years now. I hope that this message finds someone who is able to help me... I dont want to ask for your money... I dont want to sound desperate. The fact will remain that I am desperate, that I really do need money in order to fight this battle. I encourage you to ask questions, reply to this post, and support my cause for all fathers who are denied basic child rights. Thank you for your time. Thank you for reading my post. Mt_Dewey

It was the 17th birthday of friend and we had gone to an amusement park. He had wanted to go to a bar but he saved it for his 18th birthday which was splendid for me because I was a few years younger than him and looked even younger so there was no chance I would be allowed inside a bar. After messing around for a bit we stopped by a really dangerous but cool ride but you had to be below a certain height to ride it (Weird I know) as the seat had a cover on top as well. The ride was bassically very high and they would take you up and down with sudden jerks. The birthday boy being taller than the height limit said that he really wanted to be on that ride and would if he was of the allowed height.That was when he remembered that I was there. He started asking me if I wanted to go on the ride (I didnt) and the rest of his friends started telling me that I was lucky and HAD to go on that ride. Peer pressure always wins.I ended up on the ride and as the ride started I realized that my seat belt was broken. I held on to my seat to the entire ride and the broken seat belt didn't seem to make much of a difference until the grand finale where they take you to the very  top and bring you back. I couldn't wait for the ride to end. But as the brakes applied as the ride was coming to the bottom I went over the metal bar that was in front of my seat and onto the floor. Thankfully we were almost at the bottom and I suffered no major surgeries.Since then I promised myself that a I will not do something until I think it's okay no matter whether the people are my friends or family.



******************************



I want to start this off by stating that this is really personal & my mind jumps all over the place when I talk about the whole situation, so pardon me if I ramble or forget some details. Please also try to understand the circumstances.&#x200B;My father used to work in the Alberta oil fields, in 2015 he got engaged & started working in our province so he could be home every night. Shortly after his return, an old friend of ours stopped by and they were catching up on old times when he told my dad that he was trading on the Forex market. This friend (let's call him Matt) bet my dad that if he gave him $500 he would be able to double it in a month, skeptical but with nothing to lose my dad agreed and sure enough later Matt came back with a cheque for around $1,000. We were all shocked & surprised and so they set up a deal where my dad would give him however much money and Matt would take a percentage of it as compensation which was perfectly fine. A year goes by and both Matt & my dad have earned a lot more money, my father was moving more from the "investments" than he was making at his job, around that same time my dad started having relationship issues & temporarily moved into a house with Matt & I would go over on weekends and watch Matt trade, it was fascinating and I wanted to learn how to do it. Not long after moving in, Matt tells my dad that he's officially opening his own investment firm, got all the proper licenses, and was going to start trading for other people & asked my dad if he would be interested in a "sales" position in which he would pitch the whole idea to potential clients, now aside of all of this my dad was working a very labor intensive job which was killing his back, he was making more from his investments than work, and the position he was offered paid $50,000 per month so he agreed.&#x200B;So it started off slowly with close friends and family, the minimum investment was $500 for 3 months & there were 2 different plans you could choose from no matter how much you chose to invest, you could opt for a plan that would pay you back your initial investment if it was lost but the company would take a larger percentage of the earnings, or you could use plan 2 which was more aggressively traded & earned more money however if the money was lost then you would not receive anything in return. I had invested $500 of my own money for 3 months and ended up with $1200, there were some people who were cashing out $100,000 cheques and word got around and there was a huge surge of people investing their money. Everything was smooth sailing, everyone was getting paid and personally our family was doing extremely good. My dad was now making $600,000/yr plus his investments which added another $180,000. Matt hired around 5 more people to do sales with my dad, 3 people for reception, and even hired some people from Wall Street to help with the trading.&#x200B;The hardest part to convey about this whole situation is that everyone thought it was legitimate, and when I say EVERYONE was convinced I mean EVERYONE. Police officers, fraud investigators, everyone believed it was real & invested. Back to the main story, it is now 2017 and we have a nice house, a Lamborghini, a Mercedes S550, an Audi R8, and a Porsche Cayenne. Life was going good but with the stress of how massive the company was getting in such short of time my dad planned for a nice March break vacation in Mexico. So March break comes around and we leave for Mexico, 2 days after being there my dad gets a phone call from Matt saying "The police just raided the office, I don't know what's going on but it'll be fine. I'm heading down to the police station to figure it out." Instantly we were all panicked, sitting & waiting for a call back. Several minutes afterwards my dad gets another phone call from a detective who we'll call "David." David tells my dad that Matt has been taken into custody and that they had been investigating Matt's company for several months on the suspicion of fraud, and that he will be arrested when he returned to Canada as well. Obviously shocked & confused my dad continues talking to David and they agree on a plan for my dad to turn himself in once we got back instead of the humiliation at the airport & in front of his family. We tried to enjoy our vacation & then our last day came and we were heading back to a world of chaos. The flight home was mostly silent and I could tell that my dad was scared, angry, confused. We land and slowly walk to the front of the airport, we stood at the front for about an hour just hugging each other, but we knew eventually we would have to leave.&#x200B;We knew we had to say our final goodbyes & walked away in opposite directions. That would be the last time I saw my father for the next 3 months. My dad turned himself in the next day and then began the fight for his innocence. They seized his bank accounts, took his cars & house away, anything they could take they did. They wanted to charge my dad with fraud & several counts of proceeds of crime over $5,000.&#x200B;**\*Now I just want to take a pause to state that my memory of these events are less clear (despite being more recent) because I was dealing with my own personal issues & harassment from people thanks to these events\***&#x200B;My dad had no money for a lawyer because his accounts were seized, but he managed to get a deal where he would pay them after the trial. Meanwhile for whatever reason Matt still had the office building despite & he was allowed to sell it and use the money to pay for his lawyer, which I think is fucking ridiculous. Matt acted like nothing was wrong, completely emotionless & without a single care of the situation that they were now in. We would visit my dad every Thursday and Matt always had the exact same visiting time so we'd always have to see him, I hated him, I do hate him. My dad was only supposed to be in jail for 2 weeks but they held him for 3 months. They let Matt out before my dad, and Matt was the one who was behind all of it.&#x200B;I was never involved with the court stuff, so I can't talk about that. Most of the time was spent dealing with threatening messages from people all over our city & province. My sister was even harassed at school by a TEACHER. My whole entire life I was able to deal with really hard situations but this whole thing broke me, I'm not the same & I'll never be the same again. I failed almost all my classes in school, my attendance was next to none, and nobody understood what was going on or what it was like. My whole life was destroyed. After 3 months it is now June 2017 my dad was finally released from jail & the only charge he got was one count of proceeds of crime over $5,000. It was amazing to finally have him back and it lifted a big weight off my chest, but now he had to deal with thousands of angry people who knew who he was & for the wrong reasons, and he had ZERO money because they took away everything. Zero money, $100,000 worth of lawyers fees, and no job... Who is going to hire someone with thousands of people who hate him?&#x200B;Luckily my step mom was able to help out and keep everything afloat while he found a new job & slowly we tried to get everything set back into order, but then another issue arose thanks to Matt. Matt decided to take money from people in the mafia & invest it for them, and when things went down they came to our doorstep. So they demanded to be paid at least half back by my dad by a certain date or else there would be consequences (which I'm sure you can put 2 & 2 together) because they couldn't find Matt. Eventually my dad found a job, gave the mob what they wanted so they'd leave us alone, and was able to start paying off his lawyers fees & start saving. &#x200B;So now we're in 2018-2019, people slowly realized that my dad was innocent & stopped hating him, but a lot of friendships were still permanently lost. The good thing was that people started turning their attention to Matt who is still going on about how everyone was going to get paid back, which neither I or anybody else believes. I briefly got to read the report on the whole investigation and they had seized about $20,000,000 in cash/cheques from Matt's office. The police said that they were going to use all the money/assets seized to pay everyone back their initial investment. They also said that they were going to use all the stuff they took from my dad to help pay back everyone, but it's been 2 years and nobody has been paid back & the police have just tried to push everything under the rug.&#x200B;My dad was completely fine with giving all the money he earned from working at the company back, they have all the bank records & can trace back to when the payments first began but they insisted on taking everything including his life savings from before he even started working for Matt & they took mine & my sister's college savings.&#x200B;Our lives are relatively normal now, although it'll never be the same. My dad has a good job and is just trying to put everything behind him. I've graduated from high school but since they took our college savings away I can't afford to go, but I'm working myself to save money. Matt was supposed to be convicted about a month ago & it was suspected he would go to jail for 15-20 years however his lawyer became a judge so they pushed back his sentencing another few months (of course), so he's still roaming free. &#x200B;I believe Matt is a sociopath, absolutely no regret or remorse for anything he's done. Matt also doesn't realize that there are people who want him dead & have put prices on his head both in the free world & in every prison. If I'm being honest, Matt will probably die but after everything we've been through I can say that I don't care what happens to him. It doesn't involve me or my dad or my family, it's his own issues that he caused.&#x200B;I know I may have jumped all over the place trying to explain this, I probably forgot a lot of details. I just want to move on from this whole situation and I feel like writing it all out best as I can might help. Whenever I think about it I realize that it truly is unbelievable and sounds like something out of a Hollywood movie, but it's my life & it's what I'm dealing with to this day. We thought Matt was our best friend, he was like an older brother to me & he literally ruined our lives, guess you never know who you can trust, right?&#x200B;**P.S not looking for anyone's input on the situation so don't waste your time.**

I just was a young 9 years old boy who was in the mountain with his family. I just was walking through the forest and everything was so peaceful there, and suddenly I just saw a man, he was like 40-45 years old, I guess. He tried to kidnapped me and actually rape me. I was trying to do something but I was young and weak and literally couldn�t do anything and there was a brick next to my head when I saw this brick I grabbed it and hit the man in the head as hard as I could. He started to bleed and he fell from the hill...I go down to check him and he was dead. the next morning I was there to check him again, but he wasn�t there. And idk where he is now... no one was talking about this murder I did... the news, the social media like...no one and I still don�t know how the body disappeared. Honestly I felt so good when I hit his fucking head.

I'm working through a few things and I thought I would send my story bottle into the void of space that is a reddit internet post.&#x200B;I bought a salvaged car years ago and named him Billy because he is my special little guy even with all of his problems. I took Billy with me months after I started living in a new city, it was a challenging time for me then when the pace I was living at got a CND for subletting. I just got a job and I knew I could make it if I just saved up more money. I moved things back and forth, donated more things I didn't need and was looking for rooms to rent.So October 31st  I spend my last hours in an empty room wearing my work appropriate Hermione costume, I drove around days before to see where I could safely park my car for the night because tonight was going to be my first night homeless. I decided I would not park in the same place for too long to avoid trouble with officers, pedestrians, other homeless individuals but for now parking a few streets from a big animation studio would be my happy home. I kept essentials in my glove box and snacks in my center console. A cheap clothing cover and hanger would keep my office clothes in prime condition while all the rest would stay in a office filing box behind the passenger seat. I got a windshield cover to put up every night as I slept in the trunk with the back seat opened just a crack so no one could see me if they looked inside my car. It was a nice set up.I would wake up at 6:00 am/7:00 am before anyone else so that I could decreteley change clothes and drive to a nearby gas station to use their bathroom and brush my teeth. Buying hot chocolate or a pastry when I could kept me content and had me feeling optimistic. I would park by a Mirena and feed crows while looking for more work, gigs and a new place to live, run errands, go  to work, grab dinner then park in my happy home. I found a place to live a month later and every time I see an animated film by that studio, I think about those days when it was just Billy and me.Thanks for reading  \^-\^

My father's friend has a son who's a bit on  the spectrum (mentally deficient) and he came over to my house to stay for a few days as he had a fight with his dad for some reason,here's what we'll call everyone:mentally unstable kid: mkgirlfriend: gfme: me!so mk came to our house to stay for a few days, and i wasnt aware that he was mentally unstable as im a 14 year old retard (jk) and we were just messing around you know, doing kid things, skating and messing around and shit and he asked for my instagram so i gave it to him and he just started snooping around on who i follow, and it all started with that one fateful messagehimk started texting my gfmy gf ignored him (she tells me later) mk started to then get really REALLY personal (this was at around 4 in the morning) i didnt know he was texting her, and i was on a facetime call with my gf, my gf didnt know it was mk in my house who was texting her, so she thought nothing of it and we just continued being kids, playing minecraft and shit until my gf told me on call'baby someone keeps texting me'i replied'show me the texts'my gf showed me the texts and i recognised the name of the person who texted her, as i saw mk's instagram name.So I consulted him and just told him to stfu before i break his phone (is that jealousy? idk and idc to be honest)so i left the room and went to the living area and just played minecraft with my gfmk texted her again and yes we got into a fight, i nearly smashed mk's phone and he took a small video of me (i was half naked btw WUT IT WAS COLD!) and he then threatened to post it everwhere, he even started calling really popular people and telling them he'd pay them to post this video of mei just laughed at his lame ass and left, like, i would feel bad but he's not really retarded or mentally disabled, just a bit so he's aware of the wrongs he is doinganyway, mk came to me and wanted to fight so i stood up and leaned in for a swing but he just sat down on the sofa and started hurling insults(?) idk why lol so i just kicked him out of the room and told him to get to sleep (it was around 5 in the morning and im still trying to play minecraft) mk went to sleep, i had fun blah blah blah but this was all nothing compared to the next dayhe came to me and kept hurling insults in the morning, so i just said ok and (i was still playing with my gf) told him to get outmk talked about the video of me again so i snapped and put him in a lock on the floor so he just started screaming and he squared up(?) am i a terrible person? fuck anyways my older brother came and stopped me from doing anything to him.my brother started to talk to himmk messaged my gf something about her grandfather who has sadly passed awayi snapped and was about to beat the shit out of him but my brother told me to leave the room and so i did, i told my gf about this kid and whenever he did something i'd end the call with her and tell her i'll call her back, and so i did, she'll say 'are you ok' and 'what happened baby'i told her everything was fine we were just consulting the situation.my gf started just straight dissing tf out of this kid on instagram dms, he deserved it tbhmy brother said to mk that he shouldnt have said anything about my gf's grandpa, as our grandfather also recently died so he felt the painmk started laughingso my brother just left him to feel bad then mk started crying, and screaming that he wants to leavein the house there was me, my younger brother (8), my older brother (15), my oldest brother (19), and mk (15). Mk then went to the kitchen screaming and he grabbed the biggest knife he could see, i sent my youngest brother upstairs quickly and we calmed him down to put down the knife, then we went behind him and got him tf out of the kitchen, in my mentality, no matter who and how the person is born, if someone poses a threat to your FAMILY, you should always be defensive/offensive, dont let anything go like nothing happened. mk called the police and told them that we all locked him in and didnt let him out, my oldest brother then spoke to the police and told them that mk is a bit on the spectrum and that as a guardian, he wont let mk leave the house without supervision, (our dad was coming to pick up mk and take him to his house as we told our dad). While my brother was speaking with the police, mk heard my brother say to the police that mk is a bit on the spectrum, so mk got my oldest brother's phone and smashed tf out of it, my brother was all calm about it, and just continued to speak with the police, btw, while my oldest brother was speaking to the police, mk was having a tantrum throwing shit around and screaming.my father then came and told him to pack his things, and mk started saying that this all started because my gf was being rude to mk(?) AND I FUCKING SHITTED MYSELF CAUSE MY DAD CANT KNOW THAT I HAVE A GF WTF anyways they just left and thats when my oldest brother started getting angry and stressing that mk smashed his phone, i just said dont worry mk's dad will buy you a new iphone and we just ended all of it in memes. Sorry this post was long, idk why but today i was confronted by a knife and im just sitting here watching anime.thanks for reading!

One time a few years ago, me and my friend had another friend we didn't really like, but we still hung out with him. he was really annoying, he kept making up crap about himself to look better, even though we didn't believe him. Sometimes he kept stabbing us with pens and when we told him to stop, he  said, "Oh I'm not even doing it hard" and bull crap like that. Then one day my friend finally snapped. I saw him holding a pen in his hand and rage filling his eyes. Class was about to start and he sat down next to the annoying friend (we sat on the floor back then, it was a primary school). The teacher was about to begin when my friend held the pen up high, and jabbed the pen straight into his leg and he scram like a 4 year old and started crying. My friend didn't give a crap if the teacher was there. He was called into the principals office and I was brought because they thought I might've had something to do with it because i was defending my friend. When we arrived the teacher started yelling at me and my friend, then he said I had nothing to do with it and i was apologized to and sent back to class. I don't know what happened next but all i know, my friend got an after school detention and the annoying friend was given a warning. No other consequence for all the times he stabbed us and to this day, I still remember that loud as scream.

This is what I dreamed couple of nights ago, this dream left me shattered.I walked into a computer lab . Not a lot of ppl in there ( some of them i recognized Subconsciously). So I sat down , alone in a corner . Turned on my laptop , minding my own business. Then I heard this beautiful voice .Her : excuse me , can u tell me how to omit this .So I walked over there , taught her how to do it . Came back sat down ,still minding my own business . After a whileHer : excuse me , my mouse broken down . Can u lend me yours .So I turned around, looked at her to tell her "that i dont have an extra one and I need mine" But what i saw in her eye was "that I know u , don't u remember me " I can't seem to place her , where I saw her , where do I know her from. But she knew, i could see it in her eyes , in her smile . That she knew me . So i walked up to her , sat beside her in a chair . Looked in her eyes, the only light in the  room coming from a big window , illuminating the whole room enough so some things can be in the shadows . Sun light making her skin glow , her hazel eyes looking in to me. Asking me Her : don't u remember me?But the look of unrecognition on my face didn't bother her. As if she knew I will remember her .Me : where did I see u , where did I see u , where did I see u I started to chant these words under my breath . Looking at the window , cursing myself why can't I remember her . At same time falling into an abyss inside myself , knocking at the door of depression . Can't seem to find my way out.Suddenly these locks of hair clouded my view . And as i turned to see what was happening .She kissed meAs if I was rejuvenated. The color came back to my skin . And I remembered.That I dream about her. Ever since knew what love was , what loneliness was . I have dreamed about her.Like we use to play , hang out , do silly stuff that made us look stupid without a care in the world, all in dreams . I knew her andMe :how could I forget u , how could I forget u , how could I forget u ,how could I As I was crying , losing my sanity . How could I forgive myself . She hugged me .And all the pain went away . And I woke up .Stood up rubbed my eyes , felt tears trickling down my face . And first thing that came to my mind wasI'm never going to see her again

One night, it was in August so it was cool outside, you could have sat outside with a t-shirt on, a random woman stumbled across my house. My house is situated in an area that is spaced between the neighbouring houses, so there is a 5 minute walk in both directions before you reach either of my neighbours. As per mentioned, it was in mid August, the air was very cool with a tint of warmth. The time would have been around 11pm, the sky was dark and it was pleasantly silent. I was upstairs in my room listening to music playing softly, not too loud when I heard the front door being knocked very gently at least 3 or 4 times. I got up, paused the music and slowly crept along the hallway landing and peeked round the corner down the stairs towards the window at the bottom, (there is a window next to my front door which if stood in front of, you can see just up the top of my stairway.) I never seen anybody and went into my brother's room which is directly situated above the front door. I opened the window, leaned out and spotted a singular shadow but no physical sign of the person it cast from. The door then gently chapped again, my stomach went a bit tense inside as I walked down the stairs. I opened the door and noticed it was a young woman who by physical appearance looked to have been in her early 20s, she had blonde hair that sat at shoulder length, she was wearing a hooded top which looked a size too big because the sleeves covered her hands completely and it sat around her thigh area. She had delicate features, her skin was clear of any acne, scars, or similar that I remember; it looked smooth. She had very thin, but largely arched eyebrows that kind of gave a surprised demeanor. Her eyes were almond-shaped and I remember the pupils being a very dark shade. The lips were also thin, and I noticed they too, were on the darker shade tone. She probably stood about 5'9" tall and had a slim body type, that matched her strong jaw and chin. I said "hello" when I opened the door and almost instantly in a soft voice the woman replied, "hi." That was it, no more words were spoken on her part. I was cautiously looking behind her when I then said "are you okay? I think you've got the wrong house." She stood idle for a moment or two then said with the very same soft, controlled tone as before "where is John?" I said "who's John? I think you've got the wrong house, I'm sorry." She kind of looked shocked and said "I'm sorry. Where am I?" I answered without thought and told her the street name and my house address number. She looked at me for a short moment then said "Okay. I'll just go then. I'm sorry." I felt some relief when she turned to walk away and I said "it's okay, mistakes happen" then I waited until she was gone before I closed the door and went back upstairs to listen to my music. I would say about half an hour later, the door knocked but it was louder. My stomach felt as if it had dropped inside, I let the music continue to play and after peeking round the corner, I sneaked down the stairs and into the living room which is round the corner from the front door. I very gently pulled one blind slat down and I felt sick when I recognised it was the same woman as before. I stood against the wall motionless for a few minutes hoping she would leave, until the door knocked again. I opened it and before I could even open my mouth the woman said "is John back yet?" I felt confused beyond belief and said "John doesn't live here, I think you've got the wrong door." (Note: after I said John doesn't live here, I told her my name, foolishly.) The woman looked like she was disorientated, as if the lights were on but nobody was home. She gave me a vacant stare and said with a more husky tone "I've done it before." Then she paused and said "I'm sorry. I'll go away now." When the woman was leaving, she occasionally looked over her shoulder towards the house before taking a few more steps until she was out of sight. The next day I was out with my mum getting some shopping and a woman bumped into me, before I could say "sorry, forgive me" the woman said "hi" with a smirk that only caused her mouth to rise at one side. It was the same woman from last night



******************************



***My life�s story begins in 1985. I was the only child of the family with no siblings. It was those early childhood days when I realized that I got a very big challenge in my life: My face looked so different than all my friends. But still I wasn�t aware what a catastrophe it was going to be, still everything seemed fine. Until the day I had to go to school for the first time: For two years no school accepted me. My mom and I both have this issue: This is a genetic disorder that occurs in 1 out of 50,000 kids, it�s so rare that many doctors had no clue what was wrong with me. It was passed to me through my Mom. It affects the facial muscles only, nothing else, it just leads one�s face parts to form incompletely. I have no other issues except for my face looking different from others.***   ***After a while searching for a school, my mom was forced to get a letter signed by the doctor for me to be able to study in a school, since they told my mom that I have to go to a special needs school. Also, my mom was told that other kids would be frightened by me. They told me: �What�s your classmates� fault to be forced to see your face every day?!� Those two years were such a great challenge in my life. I even remember that when for the second year in a row, schools avoided to accept me, my mom applied for homeschooling for me instead. But still, I would go out to play with other kids. Mostly with our neighbors. They never treated me badly, but my worst days began as soon as I entered the school. Their reactions were so negative. Other kids would fear me, and even made fun of me. I used to be asked: �What are you?! Why do you look like this? Are you really a human?� I got a funny memory from those days. One day when I was studying third grade, I was walking around the schoolyard that one of the kids came close to me and began staring at me curiously. He was wondering who I am! I went close to him and said: �You know why I look like this?� �No!� He replied. He was frightened. I told him I come from the space, I am an alien! He was no more afraid of me because now he knew the reason why I look like that. He touched my face and said: �Wow, so interesting!� That was the first time in my life that someone was not afraid of me. I met him again the next day, and we became closer friends as time passed. He was the only close friend I had in that school. Now my face is even better since I have gone through many surgeries on my nose and jaw. Back then, even I myself believed that I am really a weird and scary person.***   ***After that incident, other kids accepted me a bit more. I was not expecting that much either. Just to have one or two friends would make me so happy. I didn�t expect anything more, and I was lucky to find that one friend. No matter how difficult, I finally completed my primary school. Still, I was not aware of how terrible my situation was. It was only when I entered the high school that I just came to know how catastrophic my situation is. Now I had to appear more in society. My childhood was over. Now I was seeking an answer: �Why do I look like this? Why everyone looks good but me?� My brain was bombarded with questions. Nobody would ever understand what difficult days they were for me.***   ***Gradually I believed that it�s only me and my mom who looks like this in the world. One day we went to see a doctor, I finally asked him: �Why nobody looks like me? You always condole with me, telling me that many others look like me, just show me one of those many!� That day the doctor told me: �Could you stay here for two hours? I�m going to show you one of them!� I agreed and waited at his clinic. A Couple of hours later I was called by his secretary that the doctor wants to see me. I entered his office and saw a man standing there. I was surprised. He was just like me. He had the same genetic disorder. But there was a big difference: He was way older than me, and that�s when I realized what a disaster is going to be since I could simply see my future.***   ***There were some days I used to ask my mom: �Why did you give birth to me knowing the fact that your disorder might be passed to me?!� The only thing that could make me satisfied was the fact that my mom was just similar to me. She has gone through its difficulties already. She didn�t treat me the same way her own parents treated her. I remember one day I took a taxi, I was sitting on the backseat. In the middle of the way two other girls wanted to get on the car, but as soon as they saw me they got off and shut the car�s door. They whispered something to the driver, then he turned his head back and looked at me. �May I ask you to get off please? These two ladies want to get on but they are afraid of you!� That day I had to stand next to the street for an hour until I could take another taxi.***   ***I almost got used to being treated like that. I got used to being discriminated for my differences with others, differences in which I didn�t play any role. A Long time passed since then. Now I was a grown up and wanted to make money, just like anyone else. I was looking for a job just like any other human. I was really just a human similar to others: my head, my mind, all of me was just like other individuals. But I was not treated the same as others. Back then I was so into graphic designing since I was always on my own I got so interested in art and designing. I even learnt four different instruments. I was so connected to my instruments. I lacked excitement in my life, art and music could make me excited. I learnt all those instruments on my own, without any teacher. I even learnt graphic design on my own since my mom was a painter herself. I remember the first things I have ever painted were my mom and dad�s faces. I painted my mom�s face exactly as it was. To me she never looked ugly or weird, instead, she looked like an angel to me.***   ***I used to look for vacancies every single day, I would email them my work samples. Everyone was so satisfied that I would receive a call right away that I was hired and could begin my work from the next morning. But whenever I showed up at their offices and as soon as they would see my face, they would apologize to me and say that there is no job for me to do anymore. Now I knew that my problem was getting more serious. I was 20 back then. I thought to myself: �Oh, so far it was like this, most probably it�s going to get worse after this�.***   ***I was thinking about how I could get a job? How I could marry? I used to cry every day. I used to scream out every single day. I never told my mom what was happening, I didn�t want her to feel broken-heart anymore. I didn�t want her to feel disappointed for me anymore. I would take a pillow in front of my mouth and scream into it so that no one would hear me. It was so torturing for me. I could see one of our neighbor�s son who had been to the guitar classes but he couldn�t even play a single note after 10 sessions, while I learnt guitar by myself but still my talents wouldn�t get me anywhere.***   ***For me, music was a communication channel with others. I could feel that music could distract people�s attention from my face. It could help me have people spend a little bit more time next to me. Back then nobody was willing to talk anything more than a simple greeting to me. I wanted to find a way to attract people�s attention, to be clapped by others. Music could help me. It could help me to have people look at me.***   ***When I would go for a walk outside, I could see people staring at me, and muttered: �Oh thank god we don�t look like him!� Hearing that was destroying my self-esteem. I remember one day my parents came to my room, sat next to my bed and said: �Listen dear, you should accept the truth. You�ll never get any job out there. It�s better for you to continue our family business.� But buying and selling were not in my blood. The worse thing was that I had such low self-confidence, how could I sell something to others while I couldn�t even talk confidently? But my family used to think that I am lazy to work.***   ***Until one day that I thought about portrait photography. As far as I remember, no one has ever asked me to take a photo with them among our relatives, they would only ask me to take a photo from them. I was always expecting them to ask me to take a group photo together but this never happened. That really bothered me. But then I thought to myself that maybe this is a message to me: I didn�t have a beautiful face, but I could see beauties. I could bring others in the photos beautifully. It was still difficult that someone would trust me and agree to let me take his or her photo.***   ***One day that I was walking in a park, everyone was looking at me. One of them mocked me, one of them showed me with fingers. That day I made a decision: I said to myself that I am a superstar, that�s why everyone is looking at me! That encouraged me to go after my passion. Then I applied to study at the university. The first days I was shaking. Now I was an adult and wherever I would go others were staring at me. Until a day that my life was revolutionized: One day in the music class, everyone was asked by the professor on what instruments they can play. He would name each instrument and those who knew it would raise up their hands. He called five or six different instruments and I raised up my hand for all of them. Suddenly he told me � in kind of a rude way: �What�s wrong with you? Why do you raise up your hand for any instrument I say?� �Because I really know how to play all of them sir� I replied. He couldn�t even believe it. He asked me to stand in the middle of the class and play each of them for the rest of the class. That was the point where my life completely changed.***   ***One of the greatest challenges of my life was to marry. First of all, I didn�t dare to talk to any girl. The first time I got rejected, it took me 10 years to dare again to talk to another girl. The First time I liked a girl, his dad told me something I would never forget. He said: �I want to show off to all my relatives with my son-in-law, you got nothing for us to show off with!� He even told me he feels embarrassed to tell others that I am going to marry his daughter. His words had such a negative impact on me that for 10 years after that I didn�t even dare to tell any girl that I love her. But since that day of music class, my life changed dramatically. I felt more confident since then.***   ***The second time I decided to tell a girl that I like her, I just saw a piece of light in the dark. I just asked God to help me that it happens.***   ***Wife: The First time I saw him at the university, he really looked strange to me. He didn�t look scary though, just weird and at the same time interesting. I didn�t want to talk to him at all. Even I had a guard against him***  ***- I noticed this very well, and I just tried not to push her a lot. I didn�t want to be hard to get rid of. I just tried to make her trust me, I tried to make her know that I am good-hearted. After a while that she gradually trusted me, I told her. First time I told her at the caf�.***   ***Wife: I was really shocked in the beginning, but I tried not to react in a way that upsets him. I told him I�ll think about it, but deep in my heart, I knew that my parents would never accept him as my life partner. I told him that I�ll give him an answer by Monday, but in fact that Monday never came because I assume silence implies consent! (She smiles)***   ***- I am pretty sure she couldn�t accept me in the very beginning either. But she wanted to know me more. I didn�t insist. I would just let her know that I truly love her and then would setback to let her think carefully.***   ***Wife: I saw so many things in him that I never saw in myself. I felt that he makes me feel complete. I saw bravery in him. I saw self-confidence in him. I felt that I can rely on him. That was the point when I began talking to my parents. Obviously, their first answer to me was a big no. They said don�t ever think that we would agree.***   ***- Her sister told me this is impossible, and it�s for my own good to forget her. But I could see miracles throughout all my life. I heard a voice inside me that said: �You could do it so far, so you can after this too� I tried to prove myself to her family as time passed.***   ***Wife: I brought many reasons for my Dad. But the time was so helpful too. It took them a year to finally agree.***   ***- Finally, her dad said if you really want my daughter you got to come and talk face to face with me. I decided to go to their house, even though it was so difficult for me. I could remember all those bad memories from the past once again. But finally, I decided to talk to her dad honestly. As soon as I sat in front of him, I told him frankly: �I know that my face is a big question mark for you!� Then I told him all my life�s story. I told him about my future plans.***   ***Wife: I heard what my friends and relatives said, but I never listened to them. They were no more important to me. I loved him and made my decision already. I emphasize that I never married him because I felt pity for him because I didn�t marry his face, but I married his heart and soul.***   ***- I witnessed God�s miracle in my life for one more time�***

Once, I was at court for work, and a woman walked up to me and asked me where court #123 was. I didn�t really know, so I said �well, court 124 is right here, so I�m assuming 123 is that way� and pointed down the hall.She looked at and said so calmly, but honestly �oh, I�m sorry, I can�t read. Is there any way you can show me?�.I was shocked. I live in the US, where virtually everyone whose made it passed the second grade can read. My 8 year old can read. Fast forward to just now, I was watching GOT and one of the characters can�t read, and I thought of this woman again. I�ve been all over the world with the military. Been in random third world countries, random villages, and virtually everyone I�ve come in contact with could read. The only reason I can come up with as to why this woman can�t read, is childhood neglect or abuse. It makes me sad for her. Idk what else I can do, but every now and then, I think of her and feel bad for her. I hope she is doing well.

So my former boss who is an absolute dickhead and bullied me out of the place I worked was  very excited to see the new avengers movie tonight. Little did he know that  I saw it at a midnight screening last night and sent him a message ruining the whole plot for him. Heard back from a friend of mine that still works with the company that he lost colour when he saw the message and is devastated. That will teach him to never fuck with me again!!



******************************



When I was about 6 years old, at school everyone was standing in line to use the drinking fountain, and this one kid cut the line, so I pushed him, then the teacher grabbed my arm to take me to the front office, and I really don�t like being touched, and being only 6 years old, I panicked and didn�t know what to do, so I bit the teacher, I didn�t bite her hard, but it still probably hurt.



******************************



So, growing up, I felt pretty comfortable around babies, even new born babies. I have 12 siblings, and I�m the second oldest. Plus, my older sister had kids when she was a teen, so I was constantly around babies, and I actually liked it. Most boys my age had never held a baby, for sure never changed a diaper, or burped a baby. I on the other hand, had done all of it. In fact, there was so many babies in my house growing up, that I�d had been a douche bag kid if I didn�t help out. In my teens, I even woke up in the middle of the night to help my mom out with crying babies. I was a good kid.At age 21, I got my 19 year old girl friend pregnant, and I suddenly realized that all of the training I had growing up, meant dick if I couldn�t actually afford to pay for a new child. My GF (now wife) told me she was pregnant, and I just didn�t know what to do. I mean, I was still living at home with my parents. How the hell could I take care of my own kid?Well, life happens, and I got a small apartment for me and my GF, we bought used a car, she was working part time and going to school, I was working full time. For a few months before the baby was born, we were actually doing ok. Living in Los Angeles wasn�t easy, but we did it. My GF didn�t grow up with a ton of babies in the house, so she was a little nervous about how to handle a baby, how to feed, etc. I thought I knew it all. I mean, I was a great kid who literally took care of babies in the middle of the night like they were my own. I felt like I couldn�t learn anything else, so when my GF mentioned going to a Lamaze class, I just didn�t want to go. But, to make her happy, I went.The class taught us how to breath, how to massage hands, how rub backs, and even how to make sure that we sleep when the baby is sleeping. I thought the class was bullshit, but my GF loved it.Finally, it�s time! The baby is coming. All my worries, fears, gone. I�m ready. I�m gonna be a father. Young, but a father nonetheless.After about 15 hours or so of labor, the baby comes out and I think she is the most beautiful human ever. I thought I loved her while she was still in the womb, but once I laid eyes on her, it was over. I had never felt so much love for another human in my life, and suddenly, I was overwhelmed. I cried a little. Here�s the thing, in all my experience, all my siblings, all my classes, all my baby books, I never realized that babies have a cone shaped head when they exit the birth canal. I hadn�t seen my siblings until they came home a few days later, I never been to the hospital when other people had given birth. I just missed it. So when I saw my daughters head all warped and deformed, I seriously thought she had downs. I loved her so much, I didn�t care that she had downs, but her head was so smashed and warped, She looked at minimal deformed, but mostly, like she had downs.  Doctors were congratulating me and my wife. My wife was in tears, my mom was crying, her mom was crying, my brothers in the hallway were shouting and celebrating, making a huge deal. I was so happy, but deep down, I knew my daughter was not going to have it easy. So I held her, loved her, kissed her, and sat with her for a few hours just falling in love. A few hours after all the excitement died down, after my brothers and sisters left, my mom went home, my mother in law was gone, it was just me, my young wife, and my baby. All quiet. The doctor walks in and he is talking to me about god knows what, but he seemed happy. I interrupted him finally, and asked �well doc, how bad is it. Don�t sugar coat it. Just tell me what I have to do to make sure she is happy�.He looks puzzled. He asked �uhhh, what are you talking about?��Her head doc? Don�t fuck with me man. How bad is her brain damage�.�Uhh, idk what you�re talking about. Why would you think anything is wrong with her?��Because her head is all smashed dude. What the fuck��Hahaha, are you serious right now? Dude, every baby gets that. That�s why their heads are soft, so they can fit down the birth canal. Her head will shape up in the next couple days. She�s completely healthy and does not have any defects�. Suddenly, I felt like the stupidest human on the planet. Relieved honestly, but I just felt as dumb as a box or rocks. The doc finished telling me whatever he came in for in the first place, as walks out. I heard him chuckle a little, but it wasn�t too bad. A couple of weeks later, I finally got the courage built up enough to tell my new, young, beautiful wife how she managed to make a baby with the dumbest shit on earth, and she laughed hysterically. I am no longer embarrassed of this story. I think it�s funny, so, I decided to share it with all you fine folks. And that concludes the story of how I thought my brand new baby had Down�s syndrome. She has three siblings now, and me and her mom are still together living life as best as we can. The End!TLDR: I didn�t know babies heads are soft so they can fit down the birth canal, so when my daughter was born, I thought she had Down�s syndrome.

I'll share one of mineI was just about to finish my class (before the recess) and like 15 seconds before the bell ringed, one of my oddest students to the date suddenly stood up making a big noise (and a brutal mess) and shouted: "Buen provecho!"(have a nice meal or something like that in English) , we were in calculus class, so I just stared directly to him and he told me he was sorry.Later on I found out he was sleeping (in my class >:[   ) and he was dreaming with just telling that to his granny, who is almost deaf and he has to shout so that she can hear him. 



******************************



So I'd been on this crew for maybe a month or two at that point. We did, you know, regular landscaping shit; mowing lawns, trimming hedges, but probably about 35-40% of our work was landscape architecture. Putting in patios, stone walkways, small foundations if they wanted a shed. All the way up to completely gutting the entire back/front yards and redoing everything. Planting fresh grass or laying sod, planting trees, planting bushes and hedges around the front of the house, not to mention the design work going into it. Taking a client's ideas/wishes and budget, and seeing what we could do with that amount of money. I'm just trying to show that there was a lot of planning that went into the shit we did, and a lot of hard work once we were ready to go. It was a small company, during the week it was usually just me and the owner. Weekends we had two or three other guys that would help out, and if there was a big project during the week they'd usually come then to. Again, I'm only saying all this to show that we had a really small amount of manpower, so all of us really had to step up to get these big ass jobs done that any normal company would have 10 or 15 guys on.So this one Saturday we were installing a huge patio in this guy's backyard made out of paver stones. They're concrete, about 10"x7"x2", about 11lbs each. My boss is laying them, and I'm carrying stacks of 7 or 8 of em to him from the pallet. Those things love to crack, so you gotta put em down really fucking gently. I'd have the stack a couple inches off the ground, and quickly pull my hands out. I'm flying back n forth, trying to get a bunch over to him, then go do something else while he caught up, then run him over another 60,70 stones. Rinse and repeat. So we've only been working about an hour. Got at least 7 or 8 hours to go in the day and prolly 12 hours worth of work. I'm rushing. I put down a stack of stones, don't pull my hand out quick enough, and feel a little pinch on my middle finger. I'm just like, ah shit, that kind of hurt, and I go jogging back over to the pallet for more. I'm almost there when I notice my hand feels wet, and I'm like what the fuck is this. I look down and my hand is fucking **covered** in blood. My middle finger that I thought I barely pinched is missing my entire fingerprint. This stone **ripped all the skin off**, down to the fat, from the top crease to the tip of my finger. So now I'm worried I'll lose this entire day of work and pay. I don't tell anyone anything, run to the truck and bandage the shit out of the finger, and throw gloves on so no one sees. I finished the day out, and was way more careful the rest of the day.When we're driving home, I finally take the gloves off and my boss sees my hand just covered in blood. Of course he's like **what in the fuck did you do??**  I tell him what happened and he's like: why didn't you tell anyone?!? Why didn't you go to the fucking Hospital? And I'm just like...cause there was work to be done, I'm not trying to lose this whole day's pay. He kind of laughs and tells me he still would have paid me for the whole day. But months later, once I knew him well and was kinda his second-in-command, he told me that that day really showed him what kind of worker, what kind of guy I was.So I'm not sure what the better take away from the story is. Could be that if you get hurt, don't be afraid to speak up and get treatment for yourself. Or you could say sucking it up and working through it could really pay off for you. I guess you got to use your discretion, see how bad the injury is. I'll be amazed if anyone actually reads this whole story, but if you're still with me I appreciate it!

NOTE: I am open to the idea that maybe I was just hearing things, but I implore you all to hear me out on this. I�ve never heard anything more chilling in my life. Feel free to share your thoughts on this as my thoughts are scattered and I�m not sure what to make of this.So this just happened, Saturday morning January 19th 2019. My girlfriend and I live in a pretty quiet condo complex in the suburbs, so usually not a noisy place and definitely not the place you�d find a lot of kids running around. Our condo is on the top floor (3rd floor) facing the parking lot outside, so it isn�t really uncommon to hear people outside and pick up on their conversations if they�re loud enough.Well, I just woke up about 20 minutes ago. Usually when I wake up on a weekend with no work, I�ll lay there on my phone until my girlfriend wakes up, so she was still sleeping when this happened. I can hear an argument outside in the parking lot between what sounded like a young kid (if I had to guess just based on his voice, probably no older than 12) and his father. All I could make out was the father yelling at the kid to come to him, and him counting down from 5 (as parents do). But then the kid started to sound frantic and pleaded to his dad �Please kill me please just kill me.� It was the horrifying begging from the kid that grabbed my attention. I immediately got up, thinking something seriously fucked was going on outside, when I heard screaming and then a car start and drive away before I could get to the window and see what was going on.I woke my girlfriend up in the process of me jumping out of bed. I told her what happened, and she said I could�ve been having sleep paralysis (I have it quite frequently) but it felt too real to be sleep paralysis. Plus, I was already awake when all of this went down. So now I�m just kind of trying to ignore what happened and hash out in my mind if I actually heard that go down. I�m not sure if I had witnessed a case of a kid with serious mental health problems or something far darker, and I�m not even sure if this belongs in this sub, but that�s my story. My girlfriend still doesn�t believe me but it felt too real to be delusion.

On Christmas Eve my mom's family comes over for a good get together to open presents from relatives. So my grandpa recently died and it was a sad time bad we made the most of our night but while my grandpa was alive he would always call us vonzippers because of our names. So since my grandpa died we wanted to carry that on so my mom that is a designer made all the grandchildren and everyone else shirts with the saying von zipper when I opened mine I started to tear up and then I overheard my brother whining about how he will never wear this in public because its so embarrassing to see. Easier than said no one was happy with him and it ruined the whole night 



******************************



So I was at my friend Lias house and she invited her friend jake who had some issues. So lia tells me not to piss off jake because he has a mild mental disorder which causes him to lash out. So what does my idiotic elementary self do? I piss off jake. We�re all in the pool and I start splashing him screaming I am the last air bender. Now he does not enjoy this. So he grabs my head and shoves me in the water and it feels like a solid 2 minutes and I�m gasping for air. As my vision was starting to black out lia pulls him off me. So don�t be a shitty human being or else you might mess with the wrong person

 Did you know that Bill Gates who started Microsoft worked cooperatively with Steve Jobs who started Apple? They have a very long history together, in fact Bill Gates help to bail out Apple financially at one point.Here is their 40 year story .... as short as I can make it. Even this short version is quite long. I lived through all this.  \----------------------------------------------------  The first personal computer was developed in 1975 and named *Altair*. It wasn't available for consumers. Too big and clunky. Bill Gates (Microsoft) and Steve Jobs (Apple) were working cooperatively back in those days.� Gates worked on a programming code for the clunky *Altair* called BASIC (which I learned to use). Later Steve Jobs of Apple asked Gates for his Microsoft BASIC to use in his Apple computers. With the introduction of the Apple II in the late 1970s, Microsoft's BASIC became more and more successful � even before the IBM PC was invented. When Jobs developed the Macintosh computer, Gates was his most important partner. Microsoft was actually getting over half its revenue from software for the Macintosh, like MS WORD for the Mac. But MS was also writing software for the IBM PC, the competitor desktop PC. The IBM PCs and their clones started to outsell the Apple computers. Keep in mind that Microsoft did not have any operating system at this time, just programming BASIC which was making its big sales.� MS bought all rights for QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System) in July 1981 and renamed it as MS-DOS, their first operating system. By 1983 the Apple III and Apple Lisa were losing ground fast. Apple was now the underdog. Steve Jobs signed a deal with Bill Gates for Microsoft to actually provide bundled applications for the first Mac. Prior to this Microsoft was not in the applications business. Lotus was doing that. Apple stayed proprietary with its operating system, keeping it for itself. It would only work with Macintosh computers. If people liked the Mac operating system they would have to buy a Mac computer too. Microsoft wrote its own operating system and licensed their�hardware�and�operating system�to other companies who were making clones. It copied the Graphic User Interface (GUI) and windows screens of Apple that used the mouse. Apple would sue Microsoft for copyright infringement (for using their GUI) but Microsoft threatened to stop writing software for the Mac like MS Word and MS Excel. Apple lost.   With the introduction of Windows 3.1 in 1992 Microsoft began to make great advances in the �GUI war�. The 3.1 Windows system lacked the elegance and usability of the Macintosh system 7.0, but Windows appeared good enough to most PC users. With the help of Windows 95, introduced on August 24, 1995, Microsoft caught up closer to the Mac. In 1997 Microsoft invested 150 million dollars in 150,000 Apple stocks and, according to certain rumors, paid further 100 million dollars for copyright infringement. Gates continued the development of the Internet Explorer and Microsoft Office for the Apple Mac for the next five years.� Apple would also make Microsoft�s Internet Explorer the default browser for viewing the World Wide Web on Macintosh computers. Microsoft was helping Apple stay afloat.   Apple then invented the iPhone and iPad. As a result in 2010 Apple Inc. overtook Microsoft to become the most valuable technology company.   Apple�s market value was at $222.1 billion, higher than Microsoft�s $219.2 billion. That made Apple the most valuable technology firm in the world.

When I was in fifth grade our teacher told us we were going to be dealing with dangerous chemicals for a science experiment. The kids were throwing it at each other and swallowing it. It turned out to be water and we werent allowed to do any experiments the entire year.

Alright,  so a little over a year ago my immediate family decided that it was time to return home to South Africa. My mother, father, brother and myself packed up all of our stuff and returned with the hopes of making a life there. Upon arriving my dad immediately set about selling the stuff we'd brought with us to try and raise money to open a tattoo shop. (He is a tattooist) After selling pretty much everything he had enough to open a small shop in a run down industrial park. It wasn't an ideal spot for a tattoo shop, but it was better than nothing. At the same time I got a job as a waiter, my mother worked with my dad.A few months go by and the shop really wasn't making any money, I was supporting my family on a very low waiters salary and I could see my parents were getting more and more stressed as the days went by.  Suddenly, out of the blue my parents are invited to attend this tattoo convention. They think it's going to be brilliant, it'll get their name out there and my dad will be able to show off what he can do. I volunteer to be his canvas for the event which ends with a competition for best tattoo of the day.We arrive at the convention and my dad begins my tattoo. Half way through he wants a cigarette break so, I decided to wander about and explore the stalls. During my perusal I encountered this huge guy in a biker suit. He immediately admires my tattoo and asks if I'll show his buddies. This guy then leads me over to a large group of bikers who all admire the work and ask where my dad's shop is. I answered all their questions politely and they promised to come around and get a few tattoos. I head back to my dad to continue with the tattoo.During the convention we get a lot of attention, people love my dads work and things are looking well. As soon as he finishes up my tattoo I go off to enter the competition, full of pride. When I return to my family however, there is a cluster of bikers blocking off the hallway near my dad's tattoo booth. My mother is in a panic and it turns out some guys took  my dad out back and were currently threatening him. They were the Hell's Angels. They apparently owned the tattoo scene in our area and my dad had disrespected them by opening up shop. Security was called and they told my mother that my dad had 'probably brought it upon himself'. I attempt to go through the group of guys at this time, but being a small guy I didn't even make a dent. Things are looking really bad until out of nowhere, another Hell's Angels biker runs up to the guys in the hallway and informs them that another gang is threatening violence if my dad isn't released. Turns out the guys I had been talking to earlier didn't like the Hell's Angels very much, nor did they appreciate them threatening my dad. After a few minutes my dad comes out looking slightly pale, we immediately head off home. On the way my dad informs my mum and myself that he was told that he'd have to pay a monthly rent to the Hell's Angels or they'd send people around to 'take his hands'. Considering he was earning nothing in his shop anyway and our only chance at advertising was now a bust, this wasn't an option. We contacted the police and they told us, if the bikers come around be sure to film what they do... not the most comforting advice. Anyway, after this event my dad closed his shop, and we moved to Ireland, where I am currently attending university, and my dad works for a successful tattoo shop.Just thought I'd share this true story in the hopes of conveying how potently dick-ish the Hell's Angels are in South Africa and also, I'd like to thank those other bikers who stepped in for my dad, even though I don't know their groups name.

It was near the church I go to. In the afternoon. I was fourteen, and my dad was working on a case and was interviewing the people who lived there (My dad usually works with car accidents in real life though, so this was odd from the start) There was a teenage boy and a teenage girl. The girl was playing outside with my brother. The boy was a grumpy teenager and the house was extremely small. I vividly remember walking up these steps. He and his sister still shared a bunk bed and there wasn't an actual room for them because the whole house in itself was just a giant room. I climbed up the stairs. I soon played Mario kart with this guy, and we were soon snuggling up together under the covers and we started making out. Then his mom caught us and told us to stop.Then I heard a noise from the wall. A tiny door opened. Two younger children came out and peeked around for the mom then motioned for me to come with them. They let down a ladder made of chain links. Some Virtual Reality type shit happens when I struggle to climb the ladder that makes me float to their room. What I saw was what looked like a shed looking room but without any windows. Rain leaked from the ceiling. there was only one toilet, and literally no bed. These were two children that the mother was supposed to take care of but hid because she couldn't actually take care of them. They were trapped and there was blood smeared all over the walls, but the room was somehow well lit despite there being no known source of light. These children looked so hopeful though, and their eyes showed determination. They wanted to be free.I remember my dream skipping and before I knew it, I was at Walgreens. It was a really big Walgreens and I don't know why I was there. There was a local restaurant right next to it, and a neighborhood right across the street where that house was.And then I woke up.(Also, I have more dreams if anyone wants me to share them.)



******************************



First, you�ll probably find out later on that English is not my first language - apologies for that. And also I don�t want to make another throwaway account just for this, so I just used my main account (please don�t judge me)Also this story happened when I was about three (and I�m 17 now), so I don�t exactly remember a lot of the details. I put together information from my mom, some old footage from security camera that I saw several years back (yes, those are everywhere in apartment complexes in China, even in 2006) and my own vague memory. If there�s anything that I�m not sure about, I will put a (?)OK, the actual story.So it was just after dinner and I was 3 (almost 4 at the time), and since the next day was weekend, my mom allowed me to watch some tv after dinner. Around 8pm my father came back home drunk. In China dinner with workmates are pretty usual and people get drunk a lot. When he saw me watching tv instead of, say, sleeping,  he got upset. He told me to go throw out the trash. We lived on 13th floor (not the luckiest floor to live on) in a apartment building. I didn�t really want to go because I was scared of elevators and it was cold outside. I grabbed the garbage bag and got my attention attracted back to the tv, so I stood at the door and just watched. My dad came back from the bathroom and got really mad since I was so slow. What happened next basically changed everything about my family.He pushed me out into the doorway, and I fell. I sat there started crying (?) and, of course, he just got even madder and started beating me up. At some point he bumped my head to a metal tube or something on the wall and I just passed out. (It also left a dent on the back of my head and I can still feel it today.) Normally he would have stopped if I pass out but on that day he was just l... too mad or whatever, he somehow threw me off the stairs. (Not strait off the stairwell, just, on the stairs, from 13th floor to 12th floor... you get the point) I still wonder till this day how he managed that. I was not exactly a small guy. I was, and still kinda am, by the Chinese standards, obese and at least overweight by the US standards. I assume he was trying to get me back to the apartment and somehow did that instead but I guess I will never know.He saw me laying on the floor facing down and not moving, and probably got scared and told my mom. My mom called an ambulance.So I broke my nose, my right arm, several ribs, and got a dent on my head. I actually didn�t wake up until the next day and that kinda frightened my mom. So I got my arm casted and stayed at the hospital for several days, while my mom went to the city hall to divorce my dad (that was the clever choice) and we moved out several days later. Since all these happened when I was so young I don�t think I got any childhood trauma or whatever (i didn�t even know what a divorce is and I just thought it was completely normal that I just live with my mom pretending my dad never existed, besides some occasions where I hear gossips, I wasn�t the �special one� at all) I barely thought about this thing until nowAlthough I was still in contact on phone with my dad, we talked less and less as I got older. Recently he lost his job and we started talking over the phone. I started to realize how hard his life actually is comparing to mine, and he is still struggling at his 50s. He wanted to get married again soon after me and my mom left him and, let�s just say that didn�t go well. He moved around in the country a lot and never really settled down. And now that his drinking problem is getting worse and his financials aren�t looking too good, I�m now genuinely worried about him. He told me (kinda) through the phone that the reason he married my mom was in fact my mom was pregnant with me, so I realized I kinda am the center of the whole problem... And that is, how can �me not throwing out garbage� change the entire family. So I just thought it might be a reddit-appropriate story... OK I know this is badly written and badly organized... thanks for reading anyway. Have a nice day



******************************



Allison had always loved the giant oak tree in her front yard. She loved it so much, she tied a swing to it, so she could sit next to it every day and talk to it. When she was a little girl, she always had happy thoughts, she�d tell the tree what a wonderful day she had at school, She�d tell the tree whenever she made a new friend at the playground, she�s even tell the tree when her mother made her favorite dinner. When she got older however, thinks weren�t always so good. She got into an abusive relationship only at the age of 14. Her parents found out, and punished her severely for finding a guy to love that young. Her parents were always very strict, they wouldn�t let her go outside and look at the stars late at night, they wouldn�t let her leave her room at certain times, and they would even send her to bed without supper if she disobeyed them. Whenever Allison was in her room, she Started to find new hobbies to keep her occupied. She loved to write, and she even kept a small knife with her from the kitchen, and she would etch drawings into things. Allison has been so depressed lately, she just wanted to get out. One night, she waited till her parents were both asleep, and she slipped out of her window. She lay in the grass and looked up at the stars, tears streaming down her face. She looked over at the big oak tree and started to cry even more. She gently brushed her hand over its rough surface and smiled. She slowly opened a small pocket in her sweater, which contained a pencil and a folded up piece of paper that she had also snuck out. She began to write, it�s what she normally would do if she felt stressed. After she fine she�s writing, she sat on the swing, only to find out the rope was loose. She got up off of the swing and took it off of the tree. She tied a strong knot in it, and hung it back up on the tree. She stuck the note in her pocket, and made sure it stuck out a bit, so someone would notice it. She thought if someone noticed the note sticking out of her pocket, she�s finally get some attention, because her parents would be wondering what it was. She reached into her other pocket, and pulled out the little knife. She decided, maybe she�d etch out one more drawing. After she did, she threw the knife to the ground, knowing she wouldn�t need it anymore. She looked up at the swing again as more tears rolled down her face, and quietly apologized for causing so much chaos in her parents� life. The next morning, her mother and father woke up, and called her name, but she didn�t come. They searched the house for her, but couldn�t find her, so they decided to look outside. There she was. They ran to her as quickly as they could after they saw what had happened to her. They saw the knife on the ground, it was covered in her own blood. They looked at her wrists, she had blood all over them, she had even etched drawings into her own skin with the knife. They saw the note slightly sticking out of her pocket, and they both remembered how much Allison loved to write. They pulled it out of her sweater pocket, and read it out loud. It was written in cursive, and had blood stains all over it. It was her suicide note. Her parents dropped to their knees in a state of shock and cried hysterically, all the while, not knowing what to do as their daughter, Allison, hung by her neck from the swing.

 [Part 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/ez2zxb/culling_of_flames_pt1/)With those very words, I believed I heard Rock grit her teeth. As if trying to hold her tongue for the onslaught she wanted to unfold on me. She always has been good with words, though it seems as if this time for the first time she didn't have the words to tell me. I was at a loss for what she really was thinking. It was eerily silent. If this kept up, I felt as if I needed to say something to break the painful silence.She finally uttered "How long.."It broke the silence like a first crash of lighting in an empty field. She then repeated herself again; this time completing what she wanted to say."How long have you kept this to yourself?" Rock said still making eye contact with me without breaking her gaze for a second. "I don't know for certain if the demon is-" I tried to reply. Though Rock was not satisfied with where my words were going."That wasn't the question I asked. I asked how long have you kept this to yourself?" I couldn't help but try to find another way to give her a reason for why I felt this way about our enemy. Though this isn't the time to give Rock what I believe. All she wants are straight facts. In this situation, I cannot blame her. Though at the same time, I wish she wouldn't treat me like this. Like an enemy.I quickly gave her the response she wanted."For twenty-three days."Her eyes then narrowed into mine. I tried my best to not avert my gaze from hers. Any slight sign of falsehood would mean traction of distrust from her. Rock then asked her next question in the same stern voice. "Does anyone else know of this information?"Why would she ask this? If anyone else knew of the connection I believed I had to the demon goddess; there would be hell to pay for all of us. Does she really think I would spout this to anyone else? I�ve already suffered enough detested looks from the many onlookers we passed by in each town. The last thing I�d need is a reason for them to hang me. I calmly respond to her question, so this interrogation won�t last much longer. �No. No one knows of this information but you now.� Rock finally blinks in what seemed like an eternity and lowered the blade just an inch. Just enough where the tip wasn�t reaching my upper throat, but now pointed at my mid throat. I�m honestly having a hard time telling if she is feeling either more relaxed now, or even more tense. As reliable as a partner as she is to have on our team. I often forget how rigid she can be. "Well, I suppose you aren't that dull in the head to spout such things to anyone." At least her tone seems a tad less serious than it was prior. Hopefully, she still doesn't think of me as her enemy."I can tell you aren't an enemy to our team. Though if anyone else caught wind of what you believe. There will be hell to pay for all of us. Not just you." She lowers the sword just a bit more. It's now pointing at my chest. Why must she keep pointing the blade at my vitals? I know the worst of her questions isn't over just yet. I try to remain calm, but I suppose my sweat must be saying otherwise to her. Rock tends to hate the sight of sweat, so whenever someone sweats. She tends to remove her glasses so she doesn't have to see it. I never got to ask her why she has this habit, though I suppose more so I never had the courage to ask her questions that would annoy her. She then asks what I hope to be her final question. Least that's what I hope. "When we face the demon goddess, will you have the will to strike her down?" As she asks this question she moves the sword dead in the center of my brows. I can feel the heat of the blade almost touching my skin. It makes it want to boil. It's one of the problems I face when wielding such a blade. I can't let the blade touch my skin for long unless I'd love to have my skin blister and boil. I may have the body of a mortal, but in my veins courses demon blood. No one is certain how a blade such as this would affect a demon. But I rather not touch the blade again and see what prolonged effects it would have on my face. My skins already bad enough without it being covered in boils from a holy blade again. She then asks again still trying to keep eye contact with me despite her lack of sight without her much-needed glasses. "Do you have the will to strike down your assumed mother when the time comes. Or is this realm doomed to a long cold frigid hell because of your own desires?"Desires?I barely even had the time to process what I felt about having a mother during my trip. Or why I would have a hard time striking her down. Do I even know what a mother truly is? This question brought nothing but more questions to my mind. But this isn't the time to get lost in the abyss I call my mind. Rock wants an answer, and I have no choice but to give one."I honestly don't know how to answer that. All I know is that it's our task to bring her down so this world will be saved and that's what I intend to do. But-"Oh crap, I spoke without thinking. I shouldn't have said but. Rock looked somewhat bewildered. She seemed curious as to where I was going with this but. "But...what?" She said almost in a coy tone. Didn't even know her voice could do anything else but serious. I already dug my hole, might as well finish the thought. "But, I want to know more about her. Why I'm having these dreams. And what it means to have a mother." Well, now it's out in the open. And to my surprise, Rock looked saddened by that response. Is she sympathizing with me? Or is she upset she has to now put an end to me?Rock then lowered the blade. I can finally feel the cool air of the night settling in. Never thought I'd ever feel that cool breeze again with how long that interrogation lasted. Could've been minutes; though to me if felt like a day has passed. She then handed the blade back to me and handed me a cloth to wipe the sweat off my face. I almost forgot how much I was sweating from that ordeal. After I wiped my face, she then put her glasses back on her face. I honestly don't know what else to expect from all of this. What does she have in mind for me after all of this? As if she were to read my mind, she said. "I know I'm repeating myself, but I want you to know that I know that your not our enemy." "I know� I think.""I apologize for having to put you on the spot like that. But it had to be done so I can gauge what you truly felt and did. To see if you have been foolish enough to tell others about what you felt. And to know what you have planned for all of this. Though I'm glad to see not much has changed in your personality despite this revelation. You still leap before you even see the ledge."I am having a hard time telling if shes berating me, or giving me a compliment. The duality of her personality I suppose. At least a blade isn't being kept at my throat still. I don't respond so she can finish her train of thought. "Though despite all this, I'm happy I found out this now rather than later. We are a team, and you must confine this information with us so we can all be on the same page. Lest something goes wrong along our travels. And about her being your mother, I have a hard time believing that. Though at the same time, it seems plausible. Fate has never been kind to us." Rock then looks at the floor after saying that. I tend to forget our team may be a band of heroes to save the land. We all were brought together because of a dreadful twist of fate. We all have been branded heroes by the kingdom not for our sense of justice, but for the crimes the nation believe we committed. Six months may be a short time in retrospect, but from what we endured. It felt as if a lifetime has passed. Rock then places her hand on my head. An easy task for her given her size. She's a head taller than me or Knox. She then smiled softly at me, which is something I haven't seen her do in a long time. I guess this journey has taken it's toll on us, that I've forgotten she used to be a kinder, softer person. "I also tend to forget that you haven't lived a normal life as others have. Though you may not know of what it truly means to have a family. I hope our team can at least give you an idea of what it feels like to be in a place where one looks after another. I suppose that is what it's like to have a mother. I myself cannot say for certain." Right, Rock doesn't have a family either. The only family she had was the school that took her in. But it was more of a glorified orphanage for gifted children, rather than a home. I guess she can see where I'm coming from with this.She then places her hands on my shoulders and looks directly into my eyes. "For our sake, do not falter when the time comes. If you�re unsure if you can slay the demon goddess. Confine yourself to me or Knox. Whomever you feel more comfortable with. We will understand." I don't understand what I'm feeling right now. Maybe it's a mix of reassurance that everything will be ok. Or a new sense of tension with having to make them bear my burden. But I have to tell them what these dreams are. And what I might do when I confront the demon goddess. I take a step back away from Rock and I sit down on the stump by the pond. It feels like an eternity since I got to rest my legs. As if reading my mind, Rock sits down to the stump next to me and waits to hear what I have to say. As if she knew it was something really taxing for me to say. I take a deep breath and just try to let the words flow out. "I have been having dreams about the demon goddess. And I believe she is trying to call out to me. I feel as though she's my mother. I honestly don't know what I feel about this revelation." I hold onto my knees as I say this as if trying to support my body as I bring this up. Rock is looking at me, waiting to see what else I have to say. As if she knew this isn't the end of what I was truly feeling. I bite my tongue for a second, and I finally say what's on my mind. "I'm going to see if I can try to talk to her, and try to have her stop the harm she�s causing to the world."

This has been on my mind for a while now. I just wanted to share because it really made a big impact in my life. I use to hate reading a lot. Mostly, due to English being my second language and being a first generation, I thought there were only text books and kids picture books. One day, we were told to pick out a chapter book and write about it. I hated the idea because I was in 3rd grade and had never read any. All my classmates were reading advance novels and I was embarrassed. I just took a random book and left. It was the book that change me.I have forgotten the title now, I remember being angry because the stupid teacher said it was not considered 3rd grade level and wouldn't accept my report. Anyway, the book was about this group of friends who enters a book into a fantasy land. There was a whole series about their adventure. In the book I picked, instead of the typical we fought the villain, saved the whole and so on, it was dark. They had traveled in time to when the villian was a kid and found out, he became evil after his mom died and the world threw him away. One of the kid tried to reach out and help the villian in a collasping building, but the others pulled him out and said to forget about him because he was going to become evil anyway. They eventually came back and the story cobtinues but that one kid just never really saw the villian as evil anymore. I cried. I felt pity for the characters and sad he went through life with no love or affection. Well anyway, thats my story and I just wanted to share lolThanks for reading

Let me set the scene. I was in highschool, going through puberty. One day I was in a one off sex ed class when the teacher asked us to write questions and put them in a box. Most people would want to do this anonymously, however ya boi previously came from a strict private school, where I was taught to ALWAYS write my name on the back just in case it gets lost. Can you see where this is going? The teacher in clear view of the class by chance lifted mine out first and read out to the class "WHEN IS SPUNK PRODUCED???" meanwhile my large handwriting revealing to the class that I couldn't produce semen. To prolong my humiliation I also wrote a question asking if there's a link between puberty and ecsma. I sat there trying to avoid contact with the 20+ eyeballs glaring at me, as if to say "wasn't me!". But it was no use, they knew I was the scalely kid who couldn't bust a nut. Thankfully nobody cared enough to remember but that memory haunted me for years...

I'm alive. Very much alive. Well, that's *physically* at least. *Mentally*, well, let's just say that I'm as dead as the corpses that lay buried in the ground centimetres away from my own body.To be honest, I've been buried alive for as long as I can recall. Before one of you gets smart and asks how I'm still breathing, or how I'm not starving, or even how the hell I take a piss, please just stop. If you do ask one of those questions, you are completely missing the point.So how does it feel to live with the weight of the world pushing on to you? Well, firstly, you can't move a single muscle in your body because the more you move, the stronger the Earth pushes back on you; that's definitely not what you want. So you stop moving.Also, when you've got thousands of kilograms on you, no one can hear you scream. No matter how much you pour into your cries, no matter how much you torture your lungs and no matter how hard you try to be heard, no one ever hears you. No one. Ever. Fucking hears you. CAN YOU HEAR ME? I'M DYING, PLEASE ANYONE! MY LUNGS ARE SO SORE FROM ASKING FOR YOUR HELP! DO YOU IGNORE ME ON PURPOSE? IS IT TOO MUCH EFFORT TO HELP ME FROM DROWNING UNDERNEATH THE WEIGHT OF THE GODDAMN WORLD?Ahem. Sorry about that. Where was I? Oh, right. So, when you realise that your cries aren't heard, you stop crying. And finally. When you try and escape, when you dig with every ounce of energy left in your body; when your nails bleed crimson and your hands are polluted by the grime that is holding you down to the point where you feel like nothing but a corpse, the soil above you only seems to be infinite. The more you dig, the more weight there is pushing down on you, until you can't take it anymore. You try and try to be better. To free yourself. You try to stop surrounding yourself with things that only drag you down into the ground further. You try to find someone to accompany you, so that you don't feel so lonely when the rest of the world seems so damn far away. Most importantly, you try to live.But it's useless. The hardest part about being buried alive is accepting the fact that you are alone. That there is nothing but you, the soil, and your mind. And believe me, being alone with your mind is the scariest thing that a person can experience. So when you do experience it, you realise that nothing you do is going to affect the situation that you are in. No amount of movement, or screams or digging can save you from the deepest darkest depths of the Earth that you are submerged in alone and scared to the point where it has driven you away from everyone and everything.So you stop trying.

 My mother was a strong and beautiful soul, she moved all the way across the states and sometimes worked two jobs to give her six children a better life and although we didn�t have much she made us feel like every day was an adventure.She believed in miracles and projected those beliefs onto all of us, her bubbly and uplifting personality made us the envy of all of our friends.I gave her the most grief and worry in my lifetime being the youngest, having six kids myself, failed relationships and a whole slew of other things but we were still the closest.I never wanted to make her cry but I am sure on several occasions because of my lifestyle I did.As I got older I changed my life, I started to be more present and there when she needed me. I turned my life around and am so grateful she believed in me and always stuck by my side.We talked on the phone every day, it was like the moment she popped in my head, she called me and it was the same way for her as well.The end of her life was challenging, she got cancer.I was watching my once strong classy mother wither to nothing while still trying to bring everyone's spirits up.This was hard for me, I felt like nothing could take my hero down, I moved to Washington two States away to get things ready for her and my sister before we found out she was sick. Now I am stuck with responsibilities and raising my grandchildren out here.I traveled back and forth and did whatever I could on a limited budget, getting help from friends and family in which my mother said were little miracles.On two occasions I was contacted by the hospital telling me to make arrangements, only to arrive by her hospital bedside thinking it was the end and with a few words �Mama I�m here� she came out of what the doctors said was a coma and recovered enough to go home, another one of her miracles. I stayed long enough to be sure she was on the road to mending then I had to return home.The last time I was there with her she wanted me to stay longer, this time it was different, it was almost like we both knew this was it. I couldn�t stay any longer, my granddaughter needed me home because her caregiver could no longer take care of her.I remember saying goodbye that day, I laid in her lap on her bed and she stroked my hair. I started to cry and didn�t want to let go of that moment, she was my rock.She took my face in her hands wiping my tears she said darling don�t you know? I will always be with you, this old body is holding me down, I will be more help to you on the other side. I promised her I would be back in two months, just hold on until then I told her and with that, I had to go.We talked a few times every day and I could hear her getting progressively worse to the point of someone having to hold the phone for her, I knew she was holding on for me but I couldn�t change my circumstances at home to go out there sooner.One day she called me, she sounded weak, she asked me to let her go.. I sat there on the phone and this swirl of emotions came over me.. and then a calm. �Yes mama, I don�t want to but I will let you go�. We soon hung up and I just sat there feeling empty, it was the right thing to do, she was suffering.The next night at 11:00 pm she was gone, I received �the call� from my daughter and she put the phone to my mother�s ear and I said �Mama I love you, I love you, I love you�, then her body went limp.I dropped the phone and fell to the floor in my kitchen and screamed. I was in a fog for months after that, I didn�t feel her, she was gone. Life became a repetitive chore, she took all the color with her. I started to doubt my faith and beliefs in the afterlife that we shared.I was taking my granddaughter to school one morning, we usually liked to hear music but not that day. She looked in the mirror and saw like every day my eyes were filled with tears. She said you know you don�t have to worry about your mom she is fine, she can�t be with you yet but she will be there for you. This took me back, I said what do you mean? She then began to describe to me what it looked like and what it was like on the other side, it sounded so beautiful I didn�t want her to stop talking but I held onto those words giving me some comfort.My mother was always concerned about me financially taking on so many mouths to feed and she knew that my car was crap so how this happened made me think..My ex started care-giving for a senior center near me, he became very close with one of his patients, he was a kind man named Ted, he even came to my home a few times on special occasions and we made him king for the day, he was a two war veteran so we were grateful for his services. One day he saw I had car trouble and told me to take his car, no no I said, I can�t take your car but he was adamant! He said �what the hell am I going to do with it� and with that he handed me a signed pink slip. I couldn�t believe it.Weeks went on and one day my sister needed a ride to the dollar store, I waited in my new car as she went in, I started to miss my mother and wished that I felt her presence near, if only for a moment. Just then something told me to look at the front of the car, this was odd but I got out anyway, I don�t know why I was standing out in the cold but I was. I never noticed the Jack in the box head ball on the antenna but there was something on both sides of the head, wiping away my tears my eyes started to focus.. �J� then the head and then �Y� my mothers name was �Joy�After that day I heard those words she said to me the last day we were together.. �I will be more help to you on the other side�Since then at times I do feel her near even now. Every time someone helps us or things fall in our laps like a blessing or we are able to help someone else with whatever we can do we say �thank you mom�My grandson is autistic so his understanding of certain things are limited, I know he sees things on the other side because he tells me but he still doesn�t get what he is seeing but this is unmistakable. All of my children called my mother �Mata� it means mother. There has been a few times I have heard him in the other room and one time looking right next to me and he said �Oh thank you Mata�She taught me to do my best, love the most, be the smile or kind word or gentle hand that someone might need and always keep an open mind.I feel blessed to have been able to call her my mother, and if you are looking over my shoulder �I love you Mama.�

I am looking for a story I heard when I was in speech.It was a duo/duet, meaning two people performed the script.The story was about two parents who lost their kid in a car related accident, before their daughter died, her and the father would go on car rides together and fnd lost shoes which they called "lost souls/soles" and they would put them in the trunk of the car.I remember the little girl having a phrase where when she spotted a shoe, she would say "lost soul (something?)!" which I believe may have been the title of the story but I can't seem to find it.does anyone recognise this?



******************************



I was 13 at the time, and he was 17. He moved in around that time. After some 'family debate', he (including his family) lived with us. My parents were really strict, and they forbid me from talking to him, since he had a bit of history with drugs. We did talk anyway, it was inevitable when we literally ate on the same dinner table.One day, both our families decided to go out and have some fun, but I wasn't in the mood. After some heated arguments, they decided to let me stay. And besides, being alone in the house seemed cool.Miraculously (or probably intentionally), my cousin decided to drop out while they were driving. He said that he was going to stay at a friend's house, so my parents did not see any problem with that. But that was clearly a lie, as he came back home 10 minutes later. We were alone.Apparently he wanted to use this opportunity to talk to me properly. I was really shy back then, but we ended up watching a movie together. The movie was boring, so we decided to stop halfway through and just talk. That was really the first time I have ever talked that much. It was shocking, the things I learnt about him. He was actually kind, and really sweet, and ALWAYS argued with me (which was fun). He did not seem to be the type of teenager who would usually have history with drugs.Oddly enough, our first conversation was really dirty too, though not initially. He admitted that he got an erection when he caught a whiff of me while watching the movie. I replied that I was not that attractive, and we ended up arguing about that for half an hour.Our parents came home. My parents ignored the fact that we were talking. It was so much fun that we ended up meeting up more and more. We scheduled movie nights together at midnight, called each others besties, and argued quite often too.One day, I sneaked into his room at 1 AM as usual. He was lying down, and I crept up behind him. I was shocked to see him crying quietly. At that moment, I felt like there was a white hot rod through my heart. It was just really sad to see him cry. I whispered his name (nickname), and he slowly opened his eyes. He looked at me, dried his tears, and gave me a big smile as if nothing ever happened. We watched the next movie quietly, and he kept smiling at me. I then forced myself to ask him, and he just replied "Nothing, just... my love life, I guess"...."He has a love life...?", I thought. I suddenly felt betrayed, but I did not know why. He is my cousin. I was not supposed to feel this. The movie night passed by in a blur, and we hugged each other and left.I could not sleep that night, because I kept thinking about him.He sneaked into my room after a few hours. It was 5 AM. He knew that I was awake, and whispered to me "I'm really sorry for bringing this up now, but... I think I'm in love with you...".Everything shattered at that point. I hugged my pillow even tighter, and ignored him. He left, and I started crying. Why? Why did I have to face this? A moment ago, I felt betrayed because I thought he was in love with someone else, but now... it just felt wrong, and I didn't want this. I was not in love with him. I just wanted to be best friends.I managed to fall asleep.We did not stop hanging out after that. I did not care that he was in love with me, I wanted to keep things the way they were. It was fun, HE was fun, and he seemed happy that I did not let his confession affect our relationship. Hell, we even talked more than usual, and it started becoming even more enjoyable. We eventually started talking about the confession, and I said that I was not ready for something like that. I could not live with that guilt. It just seemed wrong.He interpreted that as "I'm sorry, but... you're not good enough for me". He gave me a weak smile, and said that he needed some time for himself. I tried to hug him, but he pushed me away.That classifies as a break up, right? We got back together pretty soon after that, and this time, he did not bring up the love for a long time. After a few months, he said that the love most probably faded away. I was really happy, because I knew he had been tormenting himself for months now. But, at the same time, I was really sad. I felt a pain in my chest... I do not know why.Our relationship became increasingly sexual. After some convincing, I finally decided that I would just touch his dick since he wanted me to so badly. He had a boner, and I could not help but think how big and hard it was. I initially planned to just stroke it once, but I liked it so much that I kept feeling it - the shape, the size, the warmth. It was throbbing, pulsating, and it was just too good. And no, I did not touch it bare, I did this over this clothes.After that, I deeply regretted what I did. He began asking me to touch him more and more, and even asked me for a blowjob. I declined. I was just really sad, because it was like all his love for me had been replaced with sexual desire. It turned out that that was not the case. I was just misunderstanding things. If he really only had sexual desire left, he would just rape me or, at the very least, just keep persistently asking me over and over. Yet, he always stops asking when I say no, and then he laughs about it. He does try again the next day, but in a funny way, and he never actually seems serious. Hell, I even considered giving him a blowjob.I confronted him with these thoughts, and asked him if he really did have any love for me. It turned out that he was still in love with me, possibly even more than before. I never really asked him why he lied, but I think it was just to make me feel better because I was not myself after that confession and cried often.I was mad at him for lying, and kind of happy, but I still said no. I replied that I was NOT in love with him, and that he should just move on already. However, despite me rejecting him five times over, **he never gave up**. He did not move on. That kind of made me happy, but honestly, what was he expecting? I still was not in love with him.One night, I decided to really think about it. I tried putting all my feelings into words, and trying to understand them myself. It was not easy, but I found out that I did love him... just not romantically.The next day, he suggested that we stop talking for a while, as he'll be very busy with high school. That hit me like a truck. He will be gone for a week? I did not know why I was feeling this, I did not even love him that way, and yet... I *missed* him so much, and I wanted him so much. I could not live without him. I had this urge to just accept his confession already, but something was holding me back. **I still told myself that I was not in love with him**.The week without him passed by in a blur. The days were so boring without him, and I could not study at all. I ended up sleeping half the day, everyday. I cried myself to sleep when I thought of the pain he had gone through. At this point, we've been at it for a year.I was mentally exhausted, and I wanted to see him so bad. I tried to go to sleep, but then decided to try something else. I wanted to really think about this all over again. Putting all my feelings into words again, and trying to understand them again.That was when I realized that I DID love him, maybe even romantically. I slapped myself for thinking that, and tried to go back to sleep.The next morning, I kept having that very same thought at the back of my head. Was I in love with him? I kept denying it, of course, over and over. A week quickly passed, and I hated myself for doubting my feelings for him. "He is my best friend, NOT a lover", I kept saying myself. I tried to suppress any romantic interests I had for him. Sure, the sexual feelings were there, but I could NOT love him romantically, right?It was the last night of the week without him, and by now, the feelings grew really strong. I TRIED suppressing my thoughts, but I could not, and kept thinking about him. I recalled all my moments with him, and wrote stuff on my diary, and imagined me being with him... forever. Tears flooded my ears, happy tears. I realized that I was in love with him, and that there was nothing wrong with following your heart, even if it was incest."I'm in love with you", I whispered to myself, tears dripping out. "I'm in love with you. I'm in love with you. I really am in love with you, with all your flaws, with all my flaws". I kept whispering this over and over into my pillow, until I fell asleep.I woke up at 4 AM (weird...?), and dragged myself to the kitchen because I was hungry. I found him, just sitting there, with his face buried in his arms. He was asleep. He left his laptop unlocked, and I scrolled through his notes and found his diary. The first part that caught my eye was "I don't know what I am without you, I'm in love with you but the feeling's not mutual. It's killing me, because I **know** that you're perfect for me.". Weirdly enough, his diary seemed to be addressing me. I scrolled all the way up, and it seemed like he started writing it when he fell in love.I decided not to violate his privacy anymore, and locked his laptop. I attempted to carry him to my room, but failed and we both ended up falling halfway across his room (he was heavy lol).He opened his eyes, and immediately hugged me saying how much he missed me. I replied by saying that I was in love with him, and he looked at me with surprised eyes, and hugged me even tighter. "I knew it. I knew it. I love you too". I really wanted to kiss him, but he sort of fell asleep halfway through the kiss, and snapped back awake. We both laughed, and he fell asleep on his bed while hugging me.**Conclusion**I'm 17 now, turning 18 next month. We plan on telling our parents about us wanting to get married (ik it'll be hard), and even if we do not end up getting married, we do not care anyway. We are in love with each other, and we do not care what other people think of us. They can scream incest at us all they want, we just want to be together.Why am I posting this on Reddit? To give hope to anybody else in our situation. If you are in love with your cousin, please do not hesitate to follow what your heart wants. Friends may tell you to stop, and to just forget about the cousin. That just means they are not your real friends. A real friend would NEVER completely ignore your feelings, and just fucking neglect them to voice their own views. A lot of my friends revealed their true colors this way, and my life is much better off without them.Sure, getting married to your cousin is hard, but it is not impossible. You have to be diligent, it is a hard path, but worth it if you are following what your heart wants. Remember, **do not lose hope**.(Please upvote this and share it, I really want to give everybody in our situation hope)UPDATE: We're adopting, don't worry.

I was 15 and getting scolded for letting my boyfriend at the time finger me. It was none of their business and obviously wasn�t an appropriate thing to punish me for, but I was more concerned with how they knew. The only people who knew were me, the boy, and my diary. At first I denied it, but when I angrily asked if they read my diary they told me I couldn�t say something was not true and still insist they got it from my diary. Which... was fair. But what was I supposed to do? I had no idea how long they�d been going through my private things, but I knew they�d do it again. So I decided I�d set myself up as an unreliable narrator.I was in trouble for sexual activity, so I needed to keep the same theme. I decided to start out by writing that 2 months ago I�d gone to a New Years party and lost my virginity to this male friend my parents hated. I described it in the best detail my virgin self could, carefully avoiding details I�d never heard my non-virgin friends say. I think I wrote like 3 pages about it. Then I wrote about how great it felt to get it off my chest. I said I thought I could just not tell anyone and pretend it never happened because boy did I regret it, but I was worried I was pregnant. I said I�d gotten my friend who was a senior to bring a pregnancy test to school the next day and that I hope my parents don�t notice that I took $20 out of my account. I took the money out for real and spent it on monster.The next day I wrote about obtaining the test and taking it in the school bathroom. Google told me that they�re most accurate with your first morning pee, so I wrote about walking to school at 7am while I needed to go and having to wait until 11 for lunch to obtain the test. I wrote about how much each step hurt, how I thought that I was one sneeze away from peeing my pants. I wrote about how cliche I felt as I held the test in my hand in the high school bathroom. And how my whole body felt when I saw the little pink plus, like I could feel the panic tingling in my teeth. Again, just way too much detail about everything. I continued to write normal stuff too so it didn�t seem suspicious. But it was more like �I failed my math test and that was even worse because hormones I guess.�I laid low for a day or two, mentioning it in passing but at this point I was honestly surprised that they hadn�t noticed. So I�d just write things about finding the nearest planned parenthood and needing a ride or something, I�d mention it in passing. The next time I advanced the plot I wrote about how I got the guy to drive me to planned parenthood during Spanish class (it was his lunch) and he was surprised abortions cost money. I had about $150 but that wasn�t even close, it was $900 (the actual price, I googled it at school). The guy stood up and said it was too much, got in his car and left me there. It took me almost 2 hours to walk back to school (thanks gps for the eta) and I was too upset to go to my last class. I sat at the lake by my house and cried. I wrote about wondering how much drowning would hurt.A day or two later, there was still nothing. I was surprised, but still confident they�d ask me eventually. And if not... at that point I was having a lot of fun. I mean there�s writing fiction, and there�s writing yourself in a fictional manner, which was a super weird experience. So I just started writing about how terrified I was of my parents finding out and how I used cigarettes and alcohol to try to get myself out of the situation. That one was really fun because I could lie about anything, I wasn�t just confined to my pregnancy story. Fake me was in a real bad place. I wrote about being so drunk in Spanish class that my handwriting was illegible (that�s before lunch, so time wise it had to be Spanish) and how I knew that if I had just one more sip I could take a break from being me and not remember a thing. Finally, just over a week after I�d started this, my parents greeted me at the door with a pregnancy test. I thought that when it happened I�d have a hard time keeping a straight face, but I was actually really hurt to be right. It wasn�t funny like I thought it�d be, it was just a physical representation of all of the trust I lost. I kept it up alright. I kept insisting I was a virgin and said it was rude and inappropriate to ask me to take the test but they made me. And when that little minus sign popped up on the stick, I had just one thing to say: �I thought you didn�t read my diary, mother?�At that point I was an unreliable narrator. I couldn�t get in trouble for my private thoughts because they had no way to verify its accuracy. They didn�t bother to read after that, because what�s the point? Who wants to read fiction about their daughter having sex and drinking excessively? But I know they didn�t read it again because I found sort of an emotional abuse checklist, annotated it with examples, tucked it into my diary and left it out for them to see. I mean that time I wanted them to see it, but I know they never did. So I mean, my lie worked. I was so proud of that and I felt so clever, but I also had a hard time with the fact I was lying to manipulate them. It earned me a shred of privacy, but I don�t ever want to be that person again. I�m not going to stoop to their level ever again.

Really short story but I recently remembered what was probably my worst moment in my dating history and thought it was kind of funny



******************************



*This post will be updated as interactions occur*My first time with a girl (A short detailed Novel):Two weeks ago I had sex for the first time in my life (23 years old).� It's an interesting outcome that I never would have expected in my wildest dreams.There was an event downtown the evening this occured, thousands of people out on the streets, live music, food trucks, deals at the nearby bars.� I had just gotten done playing a jazz quartet gig and was feeling very pumped and confident. So I asked a co worker if he wanted to go check out the event.� We got drinks and wandered for an hour or so and I had a decent buzz by the time the streets started to close.��After everyone was cleared from the streets, the next destination were the bars.� Two or three had bands playing almost all night. We decided to head to the new bar on Main Street and check out the music, it was alright.� Eventually after a drink or two my coworker was invited to step up and play with the band, so he left to go get his instrument. Now I'm alone, so I decided to leave� until he was back and go check out one of the other bars with music.��This is where the title of this thread starts to come to fruition.��As I'm walking to the bar, I see one of my previous band leaders and her friend.� She looked incredibly surprised to see me, gave me a huge hug, asked where I was going, and invited me to come back to the previous bar with her.��Here's a little back story on this girl.� She is insanely gorgeous and has her own band with original songs, and was one of the first bands I ever played music with outside of jazz.� She has always been wonderfully nice to me, huge hugs, never once judged me for who I am, and we've hung out a lot over the years. She has always been in a steady relationship until recently.� We're both busy musicians, but she is 31 and I'm 23 (I look like I'm 18). She's always been like a loving sister I never had. We'll call her Jess.Back to the short novel I'm writing��We headed back to the bar and I bought Jess and her friend drinks� I was tipsy and had my arm around her hip as we walked.� The usual bar stuff happened: dancing, talking and drinking. I felt unusually close to her.As time went on everyone was ready for another round of drinks.� I bought Jess, her friend, and myself more drinks. They were incredibly pleased with how nicely I was treating them.. I usually try to be polite and pleasent person.� Jess invited me to go dance again, which was not out of the norm because of how many years I've known her. Everything was seeming usual.��Jess got really close to me when we moved out onto the dance floor and before I knew it she kissed me.. this was my first kiss! Like best kiss of my life kissed me.. and she said "no one saw." At this point my vision is blurry, but the band got done playing and everyone was starting to head out.� Jess's friend told me to make sure that Jess got home safe. So I honored that request and guarded her like a knight.��Now we had left the bar, it's just Jess and myself� my arm may have been around her waist? � She asked if I want to go get a shot at the nearby dive bar before I walk her home. Of course at this point in the night I agree.��When we got to the bar I bought our drinks again, we took the shots, and then she pulled me over to the nearby booth pulled me up to her and started making out with me!� Lord have mercy� I told her she was my first kiss embarrassingly and she just would not believe me.I felt a little weird about this.� Something in my mind could not put what was happening together.� Why in the ever loving fuck would this girl want to make out with me???? And number two, she is older than me and I was worried about what others would think.� It just didn't make sense because of how I had viewed her previously. But, now that I think about it.. I've fantasized Jess since I've known her. I just didn't imagine it happening because of the relationship she had for so long which I respected. � I have evolved as a person in the last year and I look and dress better than I ever have in my life, but In my opinion I'm still not that good looking.What happens next is even more blurry.� After we made out in plain site at the bar we left so I could walk her home.� Some people in the bar including the security guard were definitely looking at us.� On the way to her house we saw some bleachers in the street and she asked if I wanted to sit on them.� So we did and guess what? We kissed again! Deep long drawn out covered in her sloppy kisses.. I couldn't believe myself, but I was also drunk.� At some point, I asked her "why me?" and she said "Because you're nice to me."After our time on the bleachers we got up and then she stopped me in the middle of the street.. and started kissing me� again! A police officer eventually yelled at us to go make out somewhere else.� So now we proceeded to her house, and I was possibly holding her hand.We got to the front yard and she turned around, kissed me, and then yanked me onto the ground under a tree and started kissing me profusely.� I was completely baffled and couldn't stop. After what felt like ten minutes she said "Can I make you feel good? let's go inside!". This whole situation felt like a movie.We got inside and went directly to her bedroom and she threw me onto the bed and started making out with me.� At this point I am pretty drunk and have no idea of how much time is passing, but I am present and trying to understand how or why this is happening.� She is the man in this situation essentially, I have mostly no idea what I'm doing other than from porn that I've watched and articles I've read.. seems I was doing decent though.� But my guard was up my mental block wouldn't let it happen.. she convinced me though.�Next, Jess got up and turned off the lights and lit some conveniently placed candles for mood lighting.� She got on top of me, kissed me, sat up and started removing her clothes, moved down and asked "can I make you feel good?".� I said yes and she started to unzip my pants and�. Started to suck my dick. Jess knew what she was doing and.. was.. so.. good.��For some reason my body jerks away when I'm touched on certain parts of my back.I still felt uneasy, like I never imagined Jess in this situation.� I had rubbed one off to her pictures before but I just never believed such an occurrence was possible on any planet or in any universe.��We started to make out again and I proceeded to kiss her literally all over, but to my dismay now I never ate her pussy.� I didn't know what I was doing..Then she told me to remove my clothes, so I took off everything but my underwear.� I was embarrassed because I was not manscaped and not super comfortable with my shirt off.� We made out more and then she went down to my dick again, and removed my underwear. I have no idea how much time had passed but she was getting after it for a long time.� I was still pretty drunk. Before I knew it, there was this sensation.. tight and soft. I looked down and she was riding me. My jaw dropped.. I didn't have a condom, but it felt so good and I mean it was porn esque.� Crazy. Her body was perfect, more than I could ever imagine.�I.   Could. � Not.    Ejaculate.Although I'm glad I did not, I just couldn't get there.� I knew I would need to be absolutely sure to pull out at the right time, but it wasn't happening.� Jess knew what she was doing too. We tried different positions and then she started sucking me off again.� Like she was literally eating me alive and I was trying to make something happen. I told her I was close and she got on top again.� But I think eventually she rolled off looking very tired.��Jess kept making very horny playful giggles all night and she laughed again and got up to get water for us.� Then she grabbed blankets and pillows, still completely naked I realized. I said "I should probably go" in a daze and she told me "please stay!" like she was scared if I left.� She got into bed and we spooned literally all night. Jess would flip over and bury her head in my chest, always had a hand on me or held my hand, and pulled me in or moved closer if I wandered even slightly.I barely slept.� I still could not believe what was happening, almost like there was a mistake somewhere.� Like for example at a store when the clerk hands you $200 in change but you only needed $2.��In the morning we woke up and Jess realized she had to be to work soon.� Her naked body in the sunlight was the most amazing thing I've seen in a long time.� We talked a bit. And started to head out the door. I told her that was one of the most amazing nights I'd ever had and she still didn't believe that was my first time.� She thought I was messing with her.��Outside I found my sunglasses under the tree where we made out.� Then she walked up, gave me the sloppiest kiss and said "have a nice day" to which I replied "it will be amazing now!".� And I walked to my car basically covered in this girl's dna.So I went home on cloud 9 but still feeling like that couldn't have happened.� Something felt like it wasn't right. But now I'm infatuated in a weird way, I feel like I might not be good enough to be seen with her and at the very least I look like I'm 18 (23) and Jess is 31.A few days later I played music for a wedding and after the gig our drummer was very drunk.� He started making fun of me calling me gay and etc. I felt beat up when he started telling me how he's going to fix me up over time and asking why I'm so reserved but play music so well.  I thought about telling him I had a night with Jess because I knew his jaw would drop, but didn't say anything.� Later that night I went out to the bars and the drummer and another band member were there taking a smoke break outside.The drummer called a cute girl over and told her to kiss me, still in his making fun of me efforts.� So I did and it was alright.. she looked at me like I was cute before he told her to kiss me (I'm not used to looking decent).� She used her tongue too lol tasted like smoke.. luckily I have no diseases..Anyways, guess who walks out the door of the bar? Sure enough, there's Jess and her friend.� They come out and I am stunned from both getting made fun of by my drunk band mate and now seeing Jess so suddenly.� I felt embarrassed like I'd get made fun of if I tried anything with her, I mena she's gorgeous and 8 years older than me, plus I look really young.� I hugged her and said nice to see you, like I had done for years past when I only saw her as a sister of sorts. I escorted her into the bar and she joked with me and the security guard about my age being 15 (my usual gag).�I bought her and myself a drink, feeling tired and unprepared I chugged an 8% IPA.� I stayed on her all night, the guys around us were being sharks. Then later when the bar closed I quickly bought another drink and followed her outside.� But she quickly disappeared with 3 guys and never came back. I was worried and sent a text asking if she got home safely.Feeling disappointed, defeated, and intoxicated I headed home.� The next morning I woke up to a text, Jess always texts back the next morning.� She said she went home because those guys were being annoying. Relieved but disappointed for not catching that, I asked her if she'd like to come downtown for breakfast.� Jess told me her friend and dog were snoring next to her.. but she accepted my invitation.Later in the morning we met up at a breakfast joint, but her friend was with her.� I was really glad to see Jess and we were all sort of hung over, but it was weird that she had a third wheel.. maybe me?  Usually at this point when I'm trying to get with a girl it starts to go down hill.  I started getting into my own head.� Jess was very present and at one point talked about her anxiety that keeps her from sleeping. I couldn't tell if she was alluding to relationship things in our conversations. I was still baffled beyond the point of awe and couldn't imagine her wanting to be with me.��I also played it sort of cool with her friend being around.After breakfast I insisted on paying for the food. As we were walking down the street getting ready to say goodbye Jess brushed my cheek with her hand and said "your skin is so soft! (I flinched) Oh, sorry you don't like that?". Then before we parted ways she pulled me in and kissed me on the cheek.� The next morning she thanked me for breakfast, and I invited her to a show that I'm playing the next weekend.So now I'm a tiny bit obsessed with Jess.� But I still feel like I'm at that stage with a girl where it doesn't work out.� It's now the Wednesday before my show and later in the day, I see Jess post on Facebook saying she isn't feeling well and "needs extra love today".� So of course I sent her a nice text message. She responded saying I'm sweet and that her friend has dragged her out of bed finally, sounds like she had been depressed all day.� And eventually I find myself driving to meet her at a local dive bar.��I'm starting to wonder if she's in a relationship with this female friend.When I got inside the bar Jess's friend was there and told me that Jess was outside.� It was almost like Jess's friend knew something about us.��Eventually Jess came inside, gave me a big hug, then leaned back and pushed into me while I held her hips.� I had no idea what to expect. I still can't believe this woman could like me and it's the stage where the relationship usually fails for me.� I haven't gotten past this point yet. She went to the bar to buy a drink and I offered to cover her again, to which she said I'm too nice and there aren't many guys like me out there.  She has sex with me.. so I feel like she's worth a few extra beers.We danced for a while to the awesome band, myself still feeling slightly awkward and wondering about the proper way to act with Jess.� She teased me about being cute in an alluring way. Then eventually slid away from my sight. I was worried I wasn't doing a good job hanging with her, she could get with any guy she wants.. right now and they would say yes.� Eventually she came back and asked me to dance again.��Jess told me that she was finally feeling better and relaxing and that the guy she was previously in a relationship with messaged her earlier in the same day.� He told Jess that she is crazy and a bad person for leaving him and I guess she took that to heart. I quickly stated that she is not a bad person for making that choice and that in my eyes she's not crazy.� Her face changed and she said "you haven't been in a relationship with me." I was stunned and didn't know what to say. Then Jess went to the front of the stage and started making out with her female friend and eventually they disappeared from my sight.��At this point I was feeling defeated and tanked a couple beers.� When the band stopped I headed outside to finish my drink and just stood staring off into space, wondering where I went wrong and if it was even worth worrying about in the first place.� I've known Jess for quite some time and never expected to feel this way or get so close to her.��Then from behind I heard her voice and came up, gave me a hug, and a kiss on the cheek.  Then she got into another car with some guys and her friend.� I watched them drive off and busted my beer bottle on the ground because in my mind I knew it was over.. just like with every other girl. Too my surprise Jess texted me by the time I got home saying she had fun hanging out, and that I had made her night better.  I'm thoroughly confused.The next morning I was feeling hung over and a bit horny with a healthy dose of confusion on my dealings with Jess.� I messaged her hoping that she would meet me at an event downtown to no reply, but sure enough she got back with an apology the next morning.��Since I've know her she's been bad with her phone, usually doesn't even have it on her.A few days later it was the night of my show! I put Jess on the guest list, but to my disappointment she never showed up.� The gig was a nice venue but had an interesting vibe.  I was glad she didn't come and went home, had a drink, and fell asleep in a coma of frenzied thoughts.� In the morning I woke up to a decent sized apology from Jess about how she had a bad day and went camping with her dog and how she was a bad friend for missing the show.� Of course I told her it was no sweat. This time no reply but that's okay.�We are almost in real time!� I remembered that over the coming weekend we share a birthday that's one day apart!� Unfortunately both of us are busy with music for the surrounding days and it doesn't seem like there will be much time to hang out.� I work up the courage to call her and we have a nice chat, her voice is soothing and my suspicion was correct. Time is tight and she already had loose plans.� So I proposed we meet Saturday night or sometime the next week and that I'd call her later in the week when her plans were more solid.Further into the week I gave her another call seeing if she wanted to attend a down town event, this was the same event from the night we had sex.� Jess said she would hit me up if she felt like going out, but that her family was in town the following morning.� Understandable. She has a show on Saturday and Sunday so I told her I'd try to attend her show on Saturday if time allows. But my mind was racing and I'm frantically trying to decide if I was losing her or if this was the point of no return like my past attempts at relationships.  She could get swiped up by any guy better than me.  I'm trying to decide if my mind is working against me.So now here I sit.� Wondering what the outcome of this whole thing will be.� I guess I'm afraid to show her affection because of age difference and my lack of experience with this situation.� I should see Jess tomorrow night, but I don't know what to expect or even how to act especially if her family is around.� I know mine would judge me if they saw me anywhere near a relationship with Jess.��And who knows if she wants to hang out afterwards.I'm trying decide she's not interested, all the sudden after the second phone call I got a feeling that usually doesn't lead me getting the girl.� I've never gotten this far so my mind just expects rejection. Again she's 8 years older than me and gorgeous.   To be continued this weekend...-----------------------------------------------------------------Thank you to whoever has read this.� I had to get it off my chest as I have no one that I trust to talk with about my night with Jess.��For the record I'm not this crazy in person, just had to vent every last word that came to my mind.I will continue to update this thread with my interactions and hopefully the outcome.� It's been taking over my mind because I just don't know what to believe and this has never happened to me in my 23 almost 24 years of life and I never expected it to be this good.Sincerely,Anonymous

when how where? 2008, we were out all night on an island, so we were hanging out until late midnight we had a great time going out to eat, hang out, etc, but when we finally decided to return to our hotel room we forgot something, the keys...INSIDE! it was 12 am you can't knock on someone's door and no there was no reception available there so my cousin parkoured her way into our apartment which was first floor broke into it, got the keys opened and we managed to get some sleep too!

I posted this story awhile ago but wanted to make it much much more clear So back in 2015 i got locked in the school bathroom by some kid (fake name eric).So since I didn�t know how to get out i thought to myself (hey i can crawl under the bathroom door to get out).So i started too and while trying too a staff member saw me and told me to get out.So i did then he takes me to my class and asked me to bring the other kid so i did and he came along with me.I went to the vice principals office and sat down next to the vice.He looked at me and said very scary things (non of them were sexual but it was like scary talk the young me).So he turned around and took out an old belt and showed it too us and he said �if your parents allow me to whip you i would�.Then he talked to us for a little more.He then says to us right down your stories and what really happened.Vice called my mom and dad to go to my school to pick me up after school.So after school i got talked to by my mom and a few hours later my dad because they thought that i was playing.Unfortunately back then I didn�t understand much and couldn�t say anything.I got scolded because i was playing.

So... I live in a small town with a large fountain in the town square (this'll be important in a sec). And despite it being so small... There are a lot of homeless people. Who live in groups in the alleys behind restaurants. And there was this nice teenager who's parents are really rich so he got each man a sleeping bag, a backpack, and a Thermos. I got to know these guys and it turns out that some of them are pretty young... About the same age as me... Teenagers. they were all great fun to hang out with. But one day I was walking with my boyfriend... and some guy standing near the fountain started laughing at us and saying "both of you faggots are going to hell!"At first glance I could tell that he was homeless. He looked like he hasn't shaved in decades, ripped jeans, and torn denim jacket with no shirt under it... He was also COVERED in what I can only guess is feces. So my boyfriend said to him: "shut your mouth old man before I shut it for ya!"The guy flipped us off and said "yeah!? I'll beat both of you into a pulp!"At that moment I guess my brain took over and all I remember is lunging at the guy and tackling him into the fountain. And it also turns out that he hit his head on the middle part of it... (The part where the statue sits) and he suffered a mild concussion. He didn't press charges because the guy can't afford a lawyer. All I know is that he left the town forever. And we all lived happily ever after

Alright , so this story took place back in late 2017 ( around November or December) I was in my last class of the day ( u.s. history ) . Everything was going well in the class until I went ahead and sneezed . I sneezed about 3 times and then I heard two students next to me telling me to go to the bathroom to blow my nose and to wash my hands , so I did . Once I got back to class the teacher immediately told me �why did you leave my class without permission ?!� I thought he heard the two students telling me to go to the bathroom . He then to me to get out and that I am not allowed to go back into his class until I got permission from the dean to go back in . So I went to the dean and they called the teacher to tell him that I am allowed back in to the class ,but I also got a detention.  I really wanted to say to the teacher�s  face � well excuse me for not wanting to get the students sick � but I was worried that it would get me into more trouble .

When you think about iran you immediately think about politics and you would be right but theres more to this country. First of You must know that even though i live i iran im a regular teen who watches popular movies listens to songs and plays games but doing those things means spending dollars because no sane person will accept irr so if i can ill buy stuff using dollars but some times especially recently i am not able to buy these stuff and i have learned to improvise (ceack any thing that i like and want to do i know its illegal buti have no other choice its really between use all your money from doing summer jobs birth day and now rouz to buy one game or just crack the game and when you have the econamical back just buy it legit) this and the revelation that my country is on its dying breath is the story im here to explainI was born in 2003 and for half of my life iran was an amazing country and i lived happily and thought that nothing was wrong but ever since a guy named ahmadi nejad became the president of iran this country is going to shit first time i found out about this when i was 9 and my dad had to sue his partner for hed done and the suing was succesfull so my dad put the checks in the hause safe till Saturday when the banks are open so he can safley deposit the money to the bank bu that friday we went to one oc my families houses because of some ones birthday and when we came back the back door was opened and the safe was gone the robber didnt take my wii my dads very expensive watches that he had in herited from his dad or the fucking laptop no he went straight for the fucking safe.(its good to mention that the house looked clead and none if the rooms where messed up) so my mom calls the police and when the police come and my dad describes every thing the fucking cheif of police replys by saying that the robber has crossed the border my dad told them his ex co worker is the thief but they didnt buy it so we lost alot of valuables and almost had to start from zero and that was the time i figured that there is something wrong with this country.Dollar went from 10000 irr (irainian rials) to 40000 irr wich is a 400%increase.Just think one day you wake up in the morning and only one fourth of your money is left it will freak you the fuck out wouldnt it. Yeah that's happend to my mom and dad i wasn't old enough to understand what was going on but my parents took it very chill.At the time of ahmadinejads presidentsy oil was the highests its ever been and every one was hopping on this ship who ether made them stupid rich or made them bankrupt and to make matters worse at that time bribery was at a all time high and there were alot of shady things going on like of the election of 08 wich literally every person over the legal age in tehran protested that Ahmadinejad was not the persone we voted for and there had been tampering with the fucking votes and even though more than 10 million people took to the streets in tehran no re count was demanded and surprisingly nothing went hay wire after that and the country survived because of some bad reasons but it did survive;and in the election of 2012 we got who we taught was our save and grace rouhani but we were so terribly wrong we taught that he was the best president ever he worked amazingly with his diplomatic team to work with 5+1 and was semi successfuland even managed to bring the price of dollars down but when the 2016 elections came and trump became your president every thing went down hill from here.Rouhani got realected for president but something was going terribly wrong. we found out about the massive bribarys ,stealing and all the fuck ups that goes on behind the scenes Ahmadinejad had done all of them came and bit the normall people on the ass and after a couple of days dollar skyrocketed from 30000 irr to 220000 irr and it was really frightning thats 700% decrease of the worth of rials in less than a week thats truly fucked up and now that iran has attacked one of americas drones i believe that this was one of the final straws and this country is collapsing and either the country will fall or the regime will change this is just for you to know what people are going through some people might be just enjoying riding around in theire bmws and their Porsche's but know that there are people who are getting destroyed in the cross fire of politics and corruption and those people caught in the cross fire are usually the ones who are innocent and want a normall job and life please share this so other people get informed that iran is not only about politics there are people getting caught on the cross fire

Okay so I getting in the library, I went in and said hi to somebody then got called over by a friend of the opposite gender (female). After this she said hi and started a conversation. The conversation  took a awkward turn when she unzipped my zipper on my jumper 1/3 of the way. I stepped back then she grabbed my shoulder and told me to come closer, I refused so she forcefully did it so my brain said "Shit better do it then fucking run". I went near and she said. "Are you my friend". Awkwardly I replied "um yeah I guess. Gotta see someone urgently". Then I ran.Edit: The girl in sport asked if I liked her soo yeah I am even more confused.Edit 2: I still got no idea what it was about but we are still friends and laughed it off.

Last time I played minecraft with my group of friends. It was during a gimnazjum, a thing between high-school and middle school that that only existed in my country for a short while.It all started with a lie. Me and my best friend jumped into creative and made best hidden we could. We challenged our friends to find all the secrets doors but also pretend to have made it in survival, even going as her as building fake starter hose.Shortly it turned into survival server for our friend grop. Our base ever so expanding, more secret doors more redstone. I was also building automatic farms. Some used daylight sensors as a timer. Others build thiers but they couldn't build their but they didn't stood a chance with us. We had a head start, played the moust and were the only duo on the server. Altho, idk if my friends even cared for all the secrets doors I was building as I was getting better and better at hiding them, and who cares if there is a chain of 5 secret doors you can take to get to another exit. We even build a bit of town near our base.Yet, it wasn't meant to last. First were children/egg farms. Huge hit, everyone wanted one and even single one gave us more eggs then we knew what to do. I almost made one to just spawn chickens to walk around the town.Lag was our doom, not even the chickens, but redstone. Our base lagged when louded and each morning when all farms went of.We tried reducing lag and preparing for lighting patch by replacing torches with pumpkins but pumpkin farms only added to the lag and we stopped playing shortly after. Fun time. So yeah, it was fun, but didn't lasted and we never played after that.

DAY 1OMG guys I have some weird news. I am on mobile and I am very new to Reddit, so I might have not put this in the right place. So lets get straight into it. There is a person, won't say the name, let's just call this person, Sophia. This person, does not have good parents. Her parents, BLOCKS GOOGLE and doesn't allow her to use it. Her parents get mad if she uses Google. So, one time, there was this guy talking about milk coming out from an eggplant. AND SHE DIDN'T GET THE JOKE!!! And also, there was this time where "Sophia" said that she watched a youtube video about Smash or Pass. And she was wondering why everybody was smashing. She said that that was violent, and that, that wasn't nice. And she said, why would they always smash the person, that is just hurting, like punching. And then, everybody at our table LAUGHED. We just laughed. And she was like, "WHAT?". And then we were like, you don't understand. And we said, "I don't think you understand what smash means.". And then she said, yeah I do, I'm not an idiot. And then, we said, "There are two meanings." And then she said, well I'm assuming they are both bad. And, of course, they kind of are. We all try to tell here what it actually means, but she just says, "what?". Because probably her parents are those "Karen" parents, who don't let her do anything. And doesn't let her learn F.L.A.S.H., which is just a curriculum about... health... a certain type of health ( you guys could probably fill in the gaps here ). And then, finally, the trooper says, "it means sex". And then she gasped and said, "that's a bad word". And we just said "no", "that is how a baby is made".DAY 2Then what happened, was someone at our table made a "that's what she said" joke. And then she said, "What? But that's what he said" ( Because we were watching a movie and he said pull harder ). And then he said, "I don't think you know what that's what she said means.". And then she says, yeah I do, it means that's what a person said, that happens to be a girl. And then he says, "It's a sex joke." And then she says, "How?". And then he says, "Yeah searching up". And then she says, "why would I want to search up an inappropriate joke?" And then he says, "Well just don't search it up". And then we continue the movie. And then later, she just says thats what she said after someone says something.20 MIN LATERAlso what happened, was a guy said his middle name is ben, and his last name is dover. (Say it out loud). Lets just call this guy, Sal. She said, "sal, bend over". And then i say, bruh thats inappropriate. And then to embarrass her i said i was going to tell on her, as a joke, i wasnt actually gonna tell. And then she says, "LIER THIS ISNT INNAPROPRIATE". " I CAN TELL ON YOU FOR SAYING THAT THIS WAS INNAPROPRIATE." And i say, i wasnt ever gonna tell on her. So shes like, "im telling". And then bell rang.dont worry she never told tho.Even if she did, she wouldnt have got me in trouble, because she said it.

For a bit of backstory I was 11 at the time and boxed often so I was confident in my fighting ability. Me and my friends were talking about this kid that kept on embarrassing himself by asking girls out and trying to impress them. He walked up to me and asked me how to get a girlfriend (probably because I had 1) so I just said don�t piss them off and just be nice to them. He walked away and then started talking to this random girl. They were getting on quite well until these kids that bullied the other kid started telling the girl that the other kid wet himself in p.e. I�ll call the random kid Eric and the main bully Kevin. Eric told Kevin to shut up but of course Kevin can�t keep his mouth shut so he went on and on about Eric. I walked over and only said � mate just stop lying,� to Kevin. He then punched me in the side of the head. A teacher ran over and asked what happened so I said �he punched me.� He got sent to the principal�s office and I went to class.The next day, Kevin walked up to me with Eric (they were arguing and insulting each other) and then just kicked me in the shin. It hurt really badly so I starting cussing loads until he punched me in the stomach. I moved out the way just in time but then he tried to rugby tackle me. I grabbed his arm and swung him around into a wall. Eric ran over and tried to punch Kevin but Kevin kicked me in the balls and pushed me backwards causing Eric to punch me in the neck. I fell to the ground holding my neck whilst Kevin was getting beaten up by Eric. Then Eric pushed Kevin and he fell backwards onto my chest. I was winded and was trying to get up. Eric then walked away while Kevin and I were trying to get up. He got up first and walked over to his crush. I got up and then he ran over grabbed my neck and charged me into a wall. My head collided and then I fell unconscious. I woke up 2 hours later in the school nurse�s office.

I'm at the beach and last night I got really high and don't remember much. I woke up with a knife next to me and when I looked in the mirror there were bruises on my face. My friend said I was running around showing people my boobs and threatening people I gues with the knife. They say I got the bruises because I tried to fight some other girl but I don't remember that at all. Crazy night

So me and my fianc� are looking for a kitten to expand our family . I�m more of the one who is looking while he is the �man with the money� so he calls it lol . ANYWAY , I post in a group for my hometown asking if anyone who knows of any places I can go to adopt . So the post read �ISO Any kittens looking for a furbaby� and this lady shares it , she works with pairing families up with cats (I looked on her page) and literally her response was �this is suspicious� she then writes things like �this person is no good� all of a sudden basically slandering me . WTF ?! . I don�t know this lady from a whole in the wall . Like are you kidding me ? Then I look on her page and it�s not because I want a kitten , it�s because she�s racist . She racially profiled me thinking that I was going to use the animal as bate because I have a Spanish last name . I was so appalled and disgusted . Then when I commented on her page (it�s not private) confronting her about it , she deleted it automatically thinking I wasn�t going to see it . I CANNOT believe the ignorance in people today .

This happened a few minutes ago. As I was settling down, this dude was doing his parody. It went something like "I'm gonna take Bob (not actuall name) to the old slave road." Yeah I know, it's pretty racist, but it was a joke so me and some others who heard it just laughed. Bob wasn't laughing. He just went to the dude and was talking crap to the class "comedian".

For generations as far back as man dreamed there have been things that have gone bump in the night. It�s been my family�s duty to keep the peace and watch over the dreams of the billions now in our world. As a child it was only me and my father it had to be that way since dad always explained �this job requires every second of your time�. I went to school during the week but the weekends I would go to work.......and man working under the sandman as a kid was one of the most amazing experiences of my childhood. Every weekend we would go to the attic where he would pull out his key and tap it into the wall until he found the lock to the �world of worlds�. This world has every key to every persons dreams hanging on a string as clear as water. My father had sat me down once I was old enough to understand that there are only 2 rules to being the sand man1. Always protect the dreams of others. 2. Never open a door with a broken key. The signs of a dream world in distress was when the string turned dark as night. These keys were easy to spot the world or worlds was white as snow for millions of miles. Yet the worlds in distress would always stand out and if ever there was a key beyond the horizon we couldn�t see all my dad would do was clasp his hands together and whistle through them causing the keys to shift leaving only the distressed worlds in front of us. There were always a lot of keys to go through but my father had been doing this for decades. He was used to seeing some of these scenarios. Lost loved ones appearing in dreams would be moved out of the dream in a way that would provide closer. Fear would almost always require a fight for fear was a beast all its own. Anxiety was tough to get through but so long as we could get to the dreamer and calm them down it would be fine. Sometimes our adventures would lead to some beautiful worlds though. My father always went into at least one dream world he saved from the night before to see his works payoff. One day when we finished our work and we�re heading back home though I stumbled across what seemed like a beach but it was dark and dusty. I crept closer to the beach only to realize they were broken keys rusting away. I bent over to pick one up when my dad came behind me and told me to never open those worlds. He�d say that those worlds were lost to the chaos of fears and anxiety and that opening them back up would cause the doors to collapse in on themselves leaving the dreamer a dreamless zombie.

So imma start my story here.  I�m an obese 13 year old that weighs 190 pounds exactly. And of course that most stories I�m to much of a pussy to my crush out.    Sooo my plan is to lose widget over summer break then ask her out.  You see my plan.  Well this is where it goes wrong.   ITS MY BEST FRIENDS COUSIN so I�m screwed thanks!



******************************



So I was in like 5th or 6th grade and this guy named Clark(Not his real name) was a bully.He would beat people up and call them names. So one day I had enough. We were all walking back from gym to change when I realized Clark was in front of me. So with all my might I pulled down his pants and the security camera caught it all. He beat the hell of me but it was worth it. I would pay a lot of money to see that clip.

So I was looking through my phone and I found a picture of last Halloween and figured j would talk about it. So I am a 15 year old guy and the day before halloween, and me and my crush who are really good friends were hanging out and she asked what I was gunna be for Halloween. I was planning on just staying home because I had a headache so I told her nothing. She went on to say that I needed to do Halloween so I told her that even if I did halloween, I don't have a costume. This leaded into me making the bet that if she can guess the three things that I was thinking of in the room then I would go... As a girl. (I'm a straight male) I don't know how, I think she saw where I was looking but she guessed ALL 3 RIGHT! She ended up screaming "GUESS WHO'S COMING OVER A HOUR AND A HALF EARLY TOMORROW! " So the next day I show up to her house a hour and a half early and she told me to bring a wig. I thought ok that makes sense, and I was thinking that she would just put some makeup on me and I would wear a Hoody or something...... That's not what happened. What REALLY happened was...... She handed me a bunch of clothes and said try these. So what happened was she wanted me to put on HER clothes, wear fake nails, the makeup, AND HER FUCKING BRA! The worst part was at this time I had a crush on her so imagine how weird it is to put on the clothes of the girl you like in front of her. So I put on the pants which are the skin tight pants I don't know what they are called, the bra which was fucking weird, and the shirt which was one of those shorts where you can see part of the stomach. So I walk out of the bathrooms and I swear I cannot tell you how hilarious it was for the girl I like to tell me that my breasts were flat. So we laughed for a bit, we used some extra clothes to simulate breasts, she helped me put on  the fake nails, she painted my toenails, and the makeup......... I looked in the mirror and couldn't stop laughing at the fact that she won the bet that started this. After that she made the wig look nice she gave me some bracelets and shit like that, took a picture, and she dragged me out of her house. So we walked up to the first house and I didn't say anything, she said trick or treat, the lady opens the door, and she gives my friend candy and tells me why am I not wearing a costume. I finally speak and she starts laughing and we explain it to her and she loved it. After a while, I'm getting used to this when I see someone from school, I'm like internally panicking but my friend went up to them so I had to go and I pulled off a terrible voice and I think they believed it! They left and we laughed about they terrible voice and I was do happy to take all that stuff off. I mean the paint on my nails was hard to get off so I had to go a day in school with the fake nails and toenail paint on. The boys lockeroom was weird. But yea I took most of the stuff off, she gave me a hug for having to deal with all that shit.

(none of these names are their actual names... but they're pretty close)In my sophomore year of high school (2015) this girl I was talking to (we'll call her Ashley) and I had planned on going to the movies for our first time hanging out outside of school; however, her friend (who we'll call Casey) was going to third-wheel and I did not want that to happen at all cause it would be weird. I asked my friend Blake if he would just go with Casey and take the L for me which he agreed to do so under one condition, I buy him popcorn at the movies when we got there. Later on I was telling my buddy Brandon about the whole situation, when I mentioned the fact that Blake agreed to go if I bought him popcorn Brandon said he would go with her and he wouldn't make me buy him anything, so then I relieved Blake of his duties.The four of us went to the movies and all went well, a few weeks later Casey and Brandon became a couple. They dated until our senior year of high school and she broke up with him the spring of our graduation.This is the sad part.Brandon was so distraught and hung up on Casey that when we moved to college he still couldn't get over her even though we now lived an hour away. He lost all motivation to study in college because that was part of their original plan and ended up dropping out at the beginning of this year's spring semester and has now moved back home working one day a week at a sandwich shop while living with his parents.All because Blake wanted some damn popcorn.

Recently I talked to my grandparents about our family history. My grandmother was born an Austrian aristocrat. In 1906 my grand grand grandfather moved the family to the Czech Republic where they bought a lot of new lands and built a house in which we live in now.  My grand grand grandfather had 2 beautiful daughters. The older one (my grand grand mother) already found a high-born husband by the time the war started but the younger one was still single and just turner 20 as the war started. She was beautiful, blond, blue-eyed, aristocratic, christian, Austrian, German speaking young lady alias the �perfect� woman at the time. No wonder she caught an eye of an SS agent. He was more then 20 years older than my grand grand aunt but he offered them protection, enough food, firewood etc. just for her to submit. She agreed to his offer no matter how she disliked it she did it for the family.Our family had a housekeeper, a nanny and a majordomo. (The majordomo happened to be the black guy). The servants had a separate flat in the basement of our 4 storey house and one day when the SS agent brought more firewood and was about to store it in the basement he had an argument with the majordomo and he ended up killing him.So yeah, I just realised that a person was not only killed in my house but also killed on the exact spot where I now store my potatoes.

Hello everyone,I'm currently in a speech class and we're having a storytelling competition of sorts. I don't particularly care about winning, I get full credit just for participating, but I want my story to be as good as I can make it anyway. I figured I might as well post it here to see what you guys think! This is going to be read out loud, so there are some sentence structure errors and stuff, but that won't really matter when I'm talking. Hope you like it!&#x200B;"I�m going to tell a story that my family refers to as the �butt-hole� story, for reasons that will become clear later. So this story took place I believe on my birthday in my freshman year of high school. At the time I was the single most introverted, antisocial person ever. I mean I still sort of am today but it was on a whole different level. Anyway, at the time I had a group of friends. There were about 6 or 7 guys and a few girls in the group, but I was close to two of the guys in particular. Because of this I usually chose to do small little �parties� with just me and those two, and we�d just hang out for a while.This year, though, I decided I wanted a bigger party so I invited all the guys over to my house for the party. Since I was the way I was �party� mostly meant playing video games and just hanging out. There weren�t enough controllers for everyone to play at once, so as high school freshmen tend to do people started getting bored. Some of the guys found some Nerf swords in the closet and we had some duels, which was fun, but that was not the most interesting thing that happened.So to explain what happened I need to explain the room. Me and my siblings used it to play video games and such, but my parents also used it as a workout room. They had put most of the weights and other workout stuff in the closet in preparation, but the one thing they couldn�t move was the pull up bar that we have screwed into the wall.While some of us were playing games and some of us were fighting, one guy decided to climb up on the pull up bar and just sorta hung up there for a while. I was one of the ones playing video games, and I was really into it so I wasn�t paying attention to anything else, and then suddenly there was a big crash from the direction of the pull up bar. I have no idea how he accomplished this, but somehow the guy had got himself in a position where gravity made him spin around the pull up bar and he hit his butt full force on the wall. Normally this wouldn�t have done much except hurt but because the way the bar was mounted he hit the wall in a spot that was only drywall, so he knocked an absolutely enormous hole in the wall.We all got dead silent for a minute, just staring at the huge hole he had put in the wall. Eventually I called my dad up to take a look at it, and he was pretty chill about it. We then went down and ate cake and laughed about it, and the �butt-hole� became a running joke in my family and friend group since then.To make it even better, later on in the night the same guy managed to break a chair. I don�t remember much about how that happened but I know he did it. Suffice it to say he was never invited back to my house, and I had small parties all throughout the rest of high school.�

I don't know if this will be read at all by anyone. And I know my writing skills aren't spectacular but I hope you bear with me. Im leaving out some details due to privacy. It started out fun, as a joke. It started out the way these things usually do. Complete trust and the abuse of it. Even now I have a hard time seeing it in a bad way, despite knowing it's horrible. Why? Because I wanted it, but I was young and it went on before I entered 6th grade. How could I possibly know what I want at that age? How could I fully understand the weight of the consequences?I was molested by my older cousin, and I dont remember when it finally dawned on me. I trusted and loved him. I didn't think it was wrong, but he knew. I don't remember when it started, it feels like trying to remember a dream. I knew when it ended, he met his future ex-wife. Then that was it. It didn't bother me that it stopped, but I think that's when I began to realize what I've allowed myself to be subjected to. While most kids knew about sex in middle school, I knew more than I should. That followed me throughout life. None of my relationships lasted long. Felt as if I needed more and more. Sex, attention, communication; everything. It wasn't enough. That led me to question my sexuality time and time again. I know I'm not gay. I know because my cousin had his way with me and it's due to him that I questioned myself, though thankfully there wasn't any intercourse. Still, being confused about myself in Highschool, I experimented with a friend and instantly regretted it. It got out and my reputation was twisted ever since. The way I went through girlfriends and side girls did not help my image either. Almost every single one hates me, even after all these years it still bothers me. Is that normal? I'm not sure, but I haven't been sure of anything all my life. Is that because of what my cousin did? Only more questions than answers, always. In college, nothing really changed until I met Leslie A. I thought I knew what love was because of a girl named Jen back in highschool, but Leslie was something more. She completely won my heart with no resistance. The more I got to know her, the more I was enraptured by her. She was intelligent, clumsy, talented, unsure, tender, fierce, disciplined, easygoing, courageous, afraid, religious, liberal. A thousand words could be used to describe this beautiful, complex woman. A thousand ways I fell in love with her. Only one way I could lose her, and I did.Before we married, before we became a couple, I told her everything there is about me. Everything. She isn't the first I did this with, but she was the most important I have ever told. She still loved me. When others tried to warn her about me, about my reputation, she already knew. It shocked them. Shocked she would still trust me. There were no secrets. Truthfully, we were incredibly similar. I was molested, and she was abused by every boyfriend until me.She was broken and committed to the idea of being a house wife for the rest of her life. We consoled each other. It took a while, but sooner rather than later we began to see what we both were seeking. She admired me for rising to the top in the music program despite everything that could hold me back, and I admired her for not giving up on her dream despite everything telling her to give up. We both blossomed into wonderful performers and while still a ways to go, we became better people together.After attending a program in England during the summer, I proposed to Leslie A after making love with her. On June 20, 2015, we became husband and wife. It wasn't the wedding I truly wanted for her, and we didn't have a honeymoon. But we were happy and eagerly looked forward to the future together. I miss our first year together, easily the happiest time of my life. Best time of my life.The insatiable black hole in me came back to life, and demanded more. I beat it once before, but my mistake was not realizing it will always be something that could return. Leslie was receptive, new kinks we did in bed, the attention, everything. But she once told me she made out with a girl in the past, the thought never left. And it culminated into me suggesting a threesome, man or woman. This is where she began to slowly drift away. We talked about it in bed and sometimes out of it, but mostly she was not up for it. I never stopped until the night it happened. After a party at our house died down, it was us and another promiscuous married couple. Suggestions were already thrown in by then, and with my wife filled with enough liquor, she had sex with the other woman while both husbands watched.That part of me enjoyed every minute, but the rest knew it was wrong. In the morning, I saw Leslie cry her heart out, I hated myself. So did she.In the months that passed, I apologized with words and through actions. It was never enough. Her hate only grew and my paranoia of her leaving/cheating grew as a result. Then, we were expecting. Right before 2017, a pregnancy test was positive. We still had "sex", she made herself drunk in order to have sex with me, but my paranoia whispered thoughts it wasn't mine. I pushed that aside in an instant, I trusted her despite my paranoia. All thoughts went away as she fell down wailing at the sight of the test. Convinced our lives were going to be as twisted and unhappy as her parents. I knew what that meant, an abortion. I tried suggesting giving more thought to it instead of just reacting, and while my memory is not that accurate, I remember her saying these exact words in her retort "This is MY body."I had two options: fight for our baby and lose my wife, or support her and hope she realizes I am the man she fell in love with. Not the one who made the horrible mistake that night. I choose to support her. We didn't have money set aside since I used it to pay for her last semester of college, so I took out a loan. Gave her the money, the appointment was made, and she left without me when the day came. I was at work, while my baby was aborted. It tore me apart. I clinged to the hope that we would be able to reconcile and the death wasn't in vain. It was. Before she left, aound October 10 2017, she was in an accident during a dance rehearsal. Right in front of me. Double flip in the air and she landed head first into the ground, no padding. I rushed to her and was horrified to see she was bleeding into my hands from the back of her skull. I stayed with her until the ambulance left and followed it to the hospital. Walked in covered in her blood and waited to see my wife. They called me in, and I was by her side with my mother in law. All through the night until the okay was given to take her home. I stayed home for a week, my job understood. I took care of her, fed her, helped her wash and get any supplies she needed. When I had to go back, her sister and mother stayed to care for her. There were moments were she spoke to me like she used to "You always know how to hold me. No one has ever done anything like this for me before." It felt things were finally coming around. Through this horrible accident, we would reconcile at last. I hoped. As soon as she was able to, she left back to the theatre she was at to help out. Within days, it was just like before. And right before Christmas, she left. I tried killing myself the night before she did, something she was worried about. Yelled at me and threaten to call the police. Nothing I did was right. I fought to keep it together, held onto hope. Then in February 2018, she told me she already filed for divorce. I tried committing suicide again and again and again. But I couldn't follow through. I was trapped. I couldn't keep it together any longer and decided to leave everything behind and move 300 miles away to live with my parents. I told Leslie my plans, she understood. We fought so many times before and after she left. Each time her telling me what a demon I am, and I trying to salvage it all.I fought with her one more time before I left June 20th when I heard she was telling people I hurt her and it reached the ears of my coworkers. That was it. I haven't heard from her  since. Blocked me from all platforms. And now, here we are. It's about to be the new year and I wish out of the many times I tried committing suicide, I succeeded. I had plans and dreams, now I don't. Truthfully, I understand why she's so angry with me. I was supposed to be different, and I wasn't. Is my molestation to blame? Is it me? Both? I wish I knew, but honestly, I wish she was able to see who I am the way she used to.I might not have killed myself, but I succeeded mentally a thousand times. How do I move on from this? From her? I still have hope, it's probably a lost cause by now, but I do. I love her with all my heart. Shes my best friend, my wife. My wish is for her to call me and just catch up with me. Let me back in. What I wouldn't give to her hear voice, one last time. Im only 26, but I feel like an old man inside, full of regret and lost. If I sent this to you Leslie, I hope you pull something away from this. If there's one more thing you'll hear me apologize for, it's this:The day you left, I regret what I told you. What I wanted to say is that you're still the most complex person I've ever known and I'm amazed that I've gotten to know something as spectacular as you. I love you, now and always.

My sister has behavior issues and she doesn't just throw tantrums, she literally goes crazy and does really bad stuff. Today she was mad at my mom because she picked her up and she didn't want to go home yet and since she thinks she can do whatever the hell she wants she literally jumped from the car while I was driving and started running, so I stopped and my mom got out and ran after her and got her back into the car while putting child lock on all the doors. This was crazy and I was shocked, but the funny part was that some dude was recording everything from his car and I wish I could find him and get that video.



******************************



3 years ago I decided to do some gaming with friends. I was a very competitive player and was a die hard pc gamer, but gaming on a desktop computer involved sitting for long periods of time. Sinking all my money into my desktop left me no money to spare for a chair so I used a very hard and old wooden chair. I was the classic stereotypical raging player, constantly yelling at my team, but keep in mind I was a 16 year old tryhard. It had been almost a year of sitting in the same wooden chair whenever I would hop on to do some gaming. Then that terrible day came. It started like any other day spent on my computer, yelling here and there, I began to notice a throbbing pain in my left leg. I brushed it off as nothing but it's intensity grew more and more painful as an hour went by. I was not one to leave matches and fought through the pain till the match was won. But by that point the pain had spread to my entire leg as well as my midsection. I became concerned and soon discovered a golf ball sized swelling inside my scrotum. I was shocked at how this kind of mass could form so quickly as I usually payed close attention to my body. I tried to dismiss it and planned on making as doctor's appointment ASAP. But less than 45 minutes later the pain reached its climactic peak and I lost nearly all of my ability to walk due to the pain being so insanely terrible and sharp. I then informed my mother to take me to the ER. She then rushed me there as fast as she could, the whole trip there I was in absolute agony, not even being able to speak through the pain all I could do was lay there and hope for a speedy arrival. Eventually we parked out front of the hospital and my mom threw my arm over her shoulders and dragged my half working body into the lobby. Instantly a nurse got me into a room, and gave me morphine, which did little to help the pain. A doctor rushed in and informed me that the swelling in my scrotum was infact testicular torsion. Meaning that through all my time screaming in video games, combined with a hard wooden chair, I had successfully twisted the main vein that supplies blood to my testical. He informed me that that if he did not manually untwist it and then perform surgery soon after that I was almost guaranteed to lose it. He asked for my consent to untwist my now annihilated left nut, and I had no other choice than to say yes, due to the desperation for relief. Never before in my life have I ever let out a scream mimicking a mighty Viking for 5 straight minutes. Shortly after I was put to sleep for surgery and luckily no amputation needed to occur. But I soon found out that my other testical had the exact same issue, but the blood flow had not been completely cut off. So surgery was done on both instead of just one. Although I now have permanent stitches keeping everything together and in place I can for sure day that This was the worst experience I have had in my life.               PSA: Any male can have this medical issue occur if born without natural preventative structures. This issue can be passed down throughout a family so I advise any male to get a checkup and make sure you are not born with freefloating jewels (balls) :)

So I grew up in Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa. When I was 6 years old, 4 armed men robbed my house at gun point. Beat my dad and tied him up with his own neckties. Said some pretty fucked up stuff when I was crying, threatening to �blow my brains out�. Covered my whole family with a sheet while screaming they were gonna kill us all, luckily enough, contractors next door saw and spooked them. A lot of people from where I live now (Utah) think it�s crazy, but I always counted myself lucky. We always heard stories about armed robberies where a guy would shoot a family member as they walked in to prove a point or put a baby in an oven. I used to struggle with the memory but not anymore, I don�t think of it as anything but a good campfire story nowadays, if this provided entertainment to someone, then this post has done its job. Not sensitive about what happened.



******************************



She frantically runs back to her car and tries to open as quickly as she can as the young black man keeps walking towards her. She finally gets in, and closes the door. The man walks by the car, and the old lady gets out. She has something in her hands.She yells at the man, saying �HELLO MR. DAREN!!! How are you?� �I�m doing good mam.� Replies the man. �I got you a gift for helping me clean around my house.� She hands him the box, he opens it and sees a sweater that she knitted. �Thank you Miss Smith.� They both hug. �You are come over for dinner later today right?� �Of course. My friends and I won�t miss it for the world.� They stand there for a few minutes talking. Daren helps Miss Smith to her front door. She gives him a kiss on the cheek. And they have dinner later on in the day. The dinner was delicious. Daren and his friends clean up afterwards. The end.

 This one time I went to use a gas station bathroom. I sat down on the toilet to do the poo, and I looked ahead. I saw a tiny little graffiti conversation that went like this:"I took a shit here""I don't take shits, I leave them." I think about this often, So now whenever someone says they took a dump, I say 'GROSS! Why would you do THAT?!'.



******************************



So this is going to be a long one for anyone willing to read, So I've always been the stronger person of my family and friends, helped out everyone and didn't show any emotion when it came to sad times to be the stronger person. I never opened up to anyone the way I did to this person, she and I first started off as a thing. She was cool, and we talked for a long time. (I'm not going to lie, I'm socially akward and I have a hard time talking to people let alone opening up to them.) But anyways, me and her started talking, became friends, then things escalated, but she was hesitant. She didn't want to put a label on us and didn't want us to become offical in fear of her leaving behind a committment when she went away for college in a few months. So we were in this weird limbo stage, then she kissed some dude behind my back she originally assured me was "just a friend",instantly started dating him and then we stopped talking.I wish this was the end of the story but it isn't. One day about a month later I went to my class where one of her friends was in there with me. She comes over to me and shows me an instagram post, it was from the last time me and that girl hung out, me and her painted her parking spot then that night it all went downhill. She said on the post she was reallynsorry, didn't know how to apologize to me and that she wishes she still had me in her life. I didn't know what to do with that at the time, I thought for awhile. Then eventually after going out with friends and talking to everyone, I finally decided to shoot her a text. Weirdly enligh she didn't respond. But later that night I get a message from an unknown number, it was her. We talked, she called and apologized, broke down, the whole jist of it. After awhile we decided to finally be together, officially despite everything but she had to prove herself and gain my trust back. She knew that, and over the next couple of months she really did. She was more open about things, she hung out with me and my family more, got to know my family, even bkught my mom flowers a couple of times. She was great at the time and even randomly showed up to my work with food one time because I was having a rough day. In fact the first day we were together she came in, gave me a hug and left a note on my care saying she missed me. It was great for awhile not glong to lie.But I really didn't realize what was going on behind the scenes, what was really going on. A few months pass by, everything was great, this was just a week after New Years. Me and her hang out at her house and she tells me shes going out with one of her freinds the next day, I looked skeptical so she looked at me, cried and told me that I don't trust her, (Not going to lie, I didn't, not at all after what happened and what she did will fuck me up for a long time when it comes to trusting someone).(Also this friend of hers admitted to liking her, then flirted with her after even knowing me and her were togteher) But eventhough I didn't entierley trust her, I felt as though I should because of what she's done in the past month, so I just tell her I do and she  goes there the next day. I remember what happened and where I was so clearly it's ridiculous. I was working my usual morning shift, I think to myself "things are going to be ok, she's learned from last time, and it's all going to be ok". Then later on in the day I get a call from her and she told me that the "friend" kissed her (I swear on god that's what she said), that fucked me up bad and got me back to that place I was the first time. She said it was "accidental" and that "it didn't mean anything". I stood there silent for awhile, I just didnt know what to do. I get off the lhone for awhile and sit. Inget a ton of calls and texts from her then I get a text my my friend J, he helps me get through it then I go out to me and that girls little spot on the beach we always drove to, then think for awhile. My friends all tell me I should leave her, that it wasn't an accidnet and that I deserved better. But I stupidly try and conpromise with her, I pick her up, then we talk it out. I thought everything was gkoing to be fine after that. I was wrong. A week later she became increasingly aggresive towards me, she was mad at me that I had a family and hers was broken so I didn't "get" all of the things that were going on with her. Then we just argued and fought over the next few days, she made it seem like she didn't want to be with me anymore so finally one morning I text her saying that I loved her and that I didn't want to fight anymore, it takes two people to work a relationship, all that fun stuff. But I asked what she thought, she said thst "she didn't want to do this anymore and that she didn't feel the same way about me". Which made me more pissed than anyone could've ever imagined because 1. It meant that it was all a lie, 2. My entire world fell apart in a matter of seconds, 3. That my friends were all right about her. After that I said alot of things I regret saying, but then eventually stopped talking to her completely. Which was hard, from talking to someone every day, telling them about your day, to not talking to anyone at all as much. (As a wise man once told me) It's pretty damn depressing to come home have a million things to talk about, and noone to talk about them with.  Fast forward a month or so, I just neared the end of my vacation, I felt ok. So I text her for clpsure, she calls me, tells me her life was shit, the world fell apart on her and that she was sorry. We talk, then I said I'd think about everything. After that, I get home, think about everything then decide to get back with her. I text her, we call and I tell her I want to get back with her. She then tells me "I don't know what to think about that, meet at our spot" theb we meet, she tells me she never thinks she can trust me again after what I said and did and that she'd "think about it". The next few weeks were a living hell for me, I fought, argued, did everything and anything I ckuld to possibly try to get her back. She screams at me, saying it was my fault, even convinced me it was for a bit there and then stopped talking to me for chunks of time. Then when I'd finally start being ok, she jumoed right back in, tore hell and back. Made me think I'd get her back then tell me she didn't want it. Then the part that really got me the most was when she told me her and that guy that "kissed her" when she hung out with him, are now dating and that she can't come back. I was pissed then still tried to convince her, the guy was an asshole to her and then she blocked me. I thought this was the end, I really did unitl one day I was playing xbox with my friends and her little brother was in the party since their cousin is one of my friends, I heard her voice, heard her talking about me then I leave. I stupidly unblock her and actually get a call from her that night. We talked, then the next day she calls me, saying that shes done with that dude and that she just wants me back. I thought it was great but was scared as to what my friends and family would think, little did I know that things were going to turn. She calls me then after breaking things off sith him, and then just kind of told me that if we were to be together that she didn't want everyone ti know. She didn't want to tell her parents, or anymone. Which I thought was unfair to not only me but to them. For one, I would've told everyone the second we got back, despite the backlash because I cared about us and sneaking around is not a way to run a relationship (which she even said herself) but she still persisted. She told me she didnt give a shit what her parents thought and that their oponions didn't matter yet still said ahe wouldn't tell them so that she wluldnt get yelled at or lectured. What the fuck? So you don't care but you do about getting yelled at by them for like 5 minutes? I text her for a bit the next day, she said that "bottom line, I'm not telling my parents, I want you to be in my life but if you dont then fuck it." I text her asking if she really wanted me in her mife and she said "I do but I have no energy for that, I'm putting all my energy into school". After that I just stopped, I went out with my friends later that day and they noticed I looked drained, sad, and upset, then I broke it to them what was wrong. They told me I was being manipulated by her and that she was oreying in me for attention whether it was positove ir negative and that if I even talked to her sgain she wlukd put me back into that cycle. I thought about it and it made sense. I gave them my phone, told them to get rid of her and they did, no way to contact her, no way for her to contact me. She just wanted attention after all that time, she put me through this endless cycle of being sad, depressed, angry, just for attention. She manipulated me mentally, dragged me away from my friends and family, and fucked me up for a lifetime. Thats why I called this post "Unknown Manipulation" because the worst part was, I didn't even know it was happening. I was and still am pretty fucked up about this and its been almost 2 weeks now since the last part happened. But I'm starting to get a bit better everyday, hopefully one day I'll get to trust someone again the way I trusted her. She was my first real relationship and it was hard to let that go I guess. But thank you to anyone who read this far.Be careful to anyone you meet out there, there are some pretty nasty/crazy people. Hopefully someone can realte/learn from my mistakes and take something away from this.Thank you all for reading.

So first a little background, my friend has always been interested in this particular drug, he had been reading about all the spiritual implications and experiences others have had and it got him quite excited.We would often talk about what he read and learned, even though I won't be trying it, I am a firm believer that an adult should be able to make their own decisions.Anyway some time has passed since those initial conversations, and I awoke this morning with a message from him.... This is that message....Dmt - experience: 2"The other night I experienced what dying feels like. Although me trying to describe it does not do it justice at all.I'd had 5 or 6 beers, to give me the balls to do it in the first place. Loaded 40mg. Took one long, long puff and held.I'd already forgotten what breathing was by the 2 or 3 second mark and was completely engulfed by a wall of psychedelic light, colour and imagery.At this point I knew I'd done it. Within a split second I was transported into this experience..I was seeing myself stuck in-between 1st and 3rd person. Almost like being in a coma but being aware of it. Not being able to see out of my eyes but the feeling of intense bright light surrounding me. And somehow being inside and outside of my body simultaneously.I could hear my mother and two brothers frantically trying to revive me. "Cmon, OMG, What's he done. He needs help, help him, help"This was seconds in, but to me it felt like this was all there was. Time made no sense whatsoever. And in reality I was just on my bed in silence. But I knew I was dying... this was the end, of me. Yet I could hear and feel everything. The cries, the screams, the pleas of love and anguish and pain. Save him! Help him! Then the paramedics tried reviving me, I heard all the medical jargon and I felt them physically carry me through the front door towards the waiting ambulance. At which point I let go completely and said take me. I give up. I cant fight it anymore. This is it, this is the end. I said goodbye to everyone in my head and surrendered to the light. At which the experience gave away, faded back into my body and reality.Entities carouselled past me smiling and high fiving. And I continuously said thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you....I ran into the living where my mum was and broke down I  tears of love and joy. Told her how much I love her and my family. All this was within 10 minutes.It truly was a Divine Moment of Truth...It was all encompassing, utterly terrifying and yet so, so beautiful. The most real experience I've ever had."

This really was a story told to me by my sister when I was a child.Everything written was the story she told me when I came home from school upset.Do I believe it to be true? I don't know.I couldn�t stand school.It wasn�t as much the school as it was the children in it.I was nine years old but very short for my age and I had a lisp so all the kids called me baby, of course the bullying had affected my grades so they also called me dumb as well.Every day somebody was saying something and although I told my mother, there was nothing she could do because we were too poor for me to go to private school.After school I was met by my loving elder sister, Linda.I called her my second mom because of the vast difference in age and she cared for my siblings and myself when mom was at work.Although she completed community college and graduated in theater arts she never really did anything with her life but boy could she tell stories.They were full of drama and flair, she wrote humorous whimsical poems and she loved to sing and laugh.In the old days she would have been called an old maid but I never thought that was a bad thing.One day I came home and she could see that I was very upset, I put my lunch box in the kitchen and plopped down on the couch. �I don�t want to go back to school� I stated while wiping the tears away from my eyes.I explained that this girl who I thought was my friend told everyone about my toe (my big toe was cut off in a bicycle spoke when I was five) and that they cornered me in the bathroom, even the boys were in there wanting me to take off my shoe. After the kids saw it they started saying that I have cooties and ran away.�Could my life get any worse?�My sister just looked at me as if she was pondering what she was going to say to console me, but that look changed and she slightly smiled.She said �you know it could be worse.�She saw I had a rip in the knee of my jeans so she told me to change and bring her my pants so she could sew them while I ate my lunch and she would tell me about her childhood friend Elzbeth.She started off by telling me how she met Elzbeth.She said that it was after our mother�s first divorce, we had moved to a trailer park right outside of town, it wasn�t like the trailer parks you see today, each trailer was separated by green grass, a few trees, rolling hills and dirt roads.It was a place where people rented a trailer long enough to get on their feet then move on, she said it was a charming place in the country.This was in Georgia in the fifties.She said she was a curious little girl who didn�t see anything wrong with speaking her mind and asking questions.That didn�t set too well with our grandmother because she always said that children should be seen but not heard. Our mother on the other hand didn�t mind it at all.she always said that �Brilliance comes from a lot of answered questions.�Here is the story as told by my sister.One day mama let me go out to play in the yard, I started to chase a butterfly and found myself past two yards near some clothesline next to the neighbor�s trailer "and there she was."She was so pretty.She had long black hair, pale skin, bright blue eyes and a long grey dress to the floor.She was hiding behind one of the sheets hanging on the clothesline watching me.Well bold little me, I walked right up to her and said �Hello� the girl was surprised and stepping back a few feet.�What�s your name?�-- The girl then snatched the bow off my braid, turned and ran to her trailer, stopping on the steps she turned back to take another look at me before going inside.Well that was very rude my I thought, and marched back home and told mama all about it.Mama told me that maybe she wasn�t allowed to talk to strangers but had no explanation as to why she took my bow.A few days passed but she couldn�t get that little girl out of my mind.One day I was sitting with my doll playing tea by myself because there weren't very many children to play with in that park that time of year, anyway most of the kids from school lived in real houses on the other side of the creek.I remember that mama called me in for lunch and when I came back out my doll was gone.Despite mama and I looking for it, the doll was nowhere to be found.I cried myself to sleep that night.The next day when I went outside there she was, my doll sitting on the chair at my tea table with the bow that little girl took from me in her hair.Mama said that she must have found the doll and returned it to me and that Ishould bring her some cookies mama just baked to say thank you. So she did.I was practicing what I was going to say the whole walk there.I knocked on the door and when it opened, standing there was a big tall man who said �WHAT!� everything I was going to say flew out of my brain.A lady then brushed him aside and said �What can we help you with dear?� I just stood there and said the only words that came to my mind were �Mama said cookies, thanks� with a confused look the lady took the plate, said thank you and shut the door.Standing there on their porch I saw the little girl in the window at the back of the trailer, she smiled ever so slightly and scratched the glass with one finger as if she was saying hello.Well now I was bound and determined to no longer be a stranger because I wanted to play with this little girl.I had so many questions and I wanted to be HER friend!I must have gone over there every day asking if she could come out and play and every day her mother made excuses as to why she couldn�t.I did find out that her name though, it was Elzbeth.I think my persistence broke her mother down because one afternoon her mother said yes, but..There were rules. no swinging or climbing trees, no going in the stream and tying her dress up but most of all "there are things we mustn't discuss."I didn�t understand why there were so many rules and what Elzbeth wasn�t supposed to talk about but I didn�t care, just as long as I was able to make her my friend at last.We became very close friends that Summer, everyday felt like a new adventure.At first we could only play in Elzbeth�s yard but eventually she was allowed to come over to my yard, we played tea with my dolls and cards on the porch when grandpa would visit. There was always an extra plate set for her when she was over.Elzbeth told me that her daddy wasn�t too fond of her being over so much but she said she heard her mother tell him that it will be fine.We talked about everything, dreams, goals, favorite bedtime stories. The only thing we never talked about was why she always wore a long dark dress.She simply said that she couldn�t talk about it and that was that.My favorite times were when we would lay under the trees counting the birds on the branches, we would see circus animals in the clouds and we picked berries for our mothers.One day my grandmother was over for a visit and she asked Elzbeth why her mother didn't put her in some cooler clothes? maybe a sundress or shorts for the Summer?Elzbeth just told her that she didn�t have a sundress.Being a seamstress that sounded like a request to my grandmother having made all of our clothes growing upThe next day she handed me a gift for my friend wrapped in brown paper and tied in a pretty blue bow. Grandma said she could use for her pretty black hair.I was elated, what a wondrous surprise would this be.I ran over to Elzbeth�s trailer jumping for joy and excited to see the look on her face when she opened it.We all sat at the kitchen counter and as Elzbeth turned back the brown paper her and her mother saw a white sundress with little blue flowers just like mine. �We can be twins!� I shouted out, but the excitement was not shared.It felt like a shift in the room and it seemed to have brought a tear to her mother�s eye and her smile became sullen..She folded the brown paper back and handed it back to me telling me to thank my grandmother but that they just can not accept this.At that point Elzbeth begged to keep the ribbon and her mother said that she could.As I left their porch to walk home I heard her mother crying and apologizing to her saying that it wasn�t fair but this is how it has to be.Mama told me that maybe it was their religion, and some parents are simply more strict than others. It still didn�t seem right.The next day Elzbeth told me that she could no longer play at my house.After that I asked my grandmother to make us some long dresses so we could still be twins.In Elzbeth�s yard they had a picnic table out front where we sat and played for hours.Sometimes using her mother's blankets to drape over it so we could make a fort.This one Saturday Elzbeth�s dad was home, he worked at the mill and they didn�t work on the Weekends.They decided to beat the heat and eat outside for a change, that day they asked me to join them.There was a lot of laughter at the table that day, Elzabeth's mother made chocolate pie for dessert, that was her favorite, but when her mother brought it out I heard knocking real fast and a swoosh under the table.I didn't pay it much mind until it happened again, only this time I saw movement under the bench where Elzbeth was sitting next to me.This time I looked under the table and saw Elzbeth�s father nudge her foot slightly and when I looked up he was giving her a stern look and the swooshing stopped.Although I thought that was strange I never asked her what that was all about.It was coming time for school to begin and I was so happy to start the new year with my friend by my side, but that day never came.One day we were walking up the hill to lay in the tall grass, when we found the right spot we laid down looking up to the clear blue sky.She seemed sad that day and her eyes welled up with tears, I reached over to wiped her eyes asking her what was wrong? she replied with �I don�t want to miss you�, �Why would you miss me you live right here and we will be going to the same school together."Elzbeth told me that she was afraid they would be leaving soon. I asked her �what about school?�She then told me that she can�t ever go to school.I was so confused, I thought that everybody has to go to school.Elzbeth put her hand up blocking the sun with her pinky extended and said �Pinky promise you will never tell?� I then reached up and took her hand in mine and put it on my chest and said to her �I promise you with my whole heart� Elzbeth went on to tell me that when she wasn�t like everybody else.You look the same I told her but Elzbeth quietly and nervously laughed.�No I�m not!� she exclaimed.Just then I felt something brush against my leg and the leaves rustled. Jumping up I thought it was a snake urging her to safety.�It�s not a snake Linda�, she turned her head away and said �It�s me.�I didn�t understand what she was talking about.Elzbeth took her hand and asked me to sit back down.�I was born with a tail, aren�t you scared of me now?��No of course not!� I told her, but I really didn�t know what to say.�Why didn�t you ever tell me?�- She said that she could never tell anyone.She went on by telling me that when she was born her mother�s parents wanted her to get rid of me and when my mother said no they cast her out by telling everyone she was a witch.�I reached the age for school and my parents tried to hide my tail but one of the girls saw it and told everyone.They called me monkey and freak. I was always coming home hurt in some way, sometimes they even got physical and I came home with bruises or a bloody nose.The principal told my parents that there were places they could leave me so I wouldn't be seen and shame wouldn't be brought to my family.That hurt my mother's heart and it angered my father so we moved.The word got out in every town we moved to and some carnies showed up wanting to take me away so they could put me in a sideshow, they even offered my parents money. So we moved, and we moved."Linda My parents try their best to protect me but I know they can�t protect me forever.�My heart broke that day, what awful atrocities must she have gone through and will go through still.Now I understood everything.Elzbeth showed me her tail, noticing some scars on it she mentioned that one day she tried to cut it off so her parents wouldn't be sad anymore.We stayed there for a long time, I laid my head on her chest listening to her heartbeat until the stars came out.Elzbeth gave me a few hairs off her tail and said "don�t ever forget me" and then we both walked home holding hands.A few weeks later she was gone and I never heard from her again.The landlord said that a truant officer went to their door and talked to them, that was the last time anyone saw them.Her father never showed up for work the next day so they must have gone in the night.As Linda finished her story, she looked at me and smiled and said, �So you see my darling, you may not be able to change some things about you, but those things make you unique.They make you, you, and I really like you my dear.�I was finished eating and she was done sewing my pants so she told me �Off you go my sweetheart� and with that I headed off to my room.I stopped on the stairs and asked her if Elzbeth was real.She just looked at me then looked down and chuckled while saying �My darling, the question is do you think she was real? We will never know will we?�The next day I carried the thought of Elzbeth with me and all that she endured.When the boys said I had cooties I said YES I DO!I chased them all around the schoolyard threatening to touch them with my toe.Any time I saw someone being bullied by them, me and my toe stepped in to save the day.I made a lot of good friends that year and It didn�t bother me being different that much anymore..At least I didn�t have a tail.Many years later after my sister passed away I was cleaning out her closet.I came across a jewelry case and in that case was a little box wrapped with a blue ribbon.I opened the box and found a tuft of hair..

This happened around 2012 I cant remember which year I was in but It was when I was in at least my second year of Highschool.So we have and assembly every now and then with a speaker discussing the Illness know as HIV and AIDS. He goes to various schools with his wife and child and talks about How his life changed the constant pain he has to endure and all the hate that comes with having the sickness.He comes every year and to my knowledge he is just the main spokesman to get the word out and to educate people as others higher up organize and what not. Hes a very nice guy.Now heres the thing every year on top of him giving his life story and educating us there is a second guest that has done some work for AIDs cures and treatment and stuff like that. For example a singer came one time who sings and goes on tour to raise money for AIDs research.This year however we got actual Scientists that have spent years and years looking for a treatment with countless hours blood and sweat poured into finding a cure. 2 of them.So this year I go in with my choir class and the whole building is filled to the brim with students about 700 for the building. First guy does his speech gives his story and we move on to the Scientists. He gives a very scary speech about in all his Life AIDs in his opinion is the most sad and sadistic illness and one day him and all his friends hopefully can finally find a cure one day but its so hard to do just on how the virus is built. Goes on for about 30 minutes.After that he opens the floor to questions. Pretty standard questions come up from my classmates and stuff.But then one question came up that I didnt know at the time would cause such an outcry." What race of people is affected most by AIDS " asked one girlThey talked to themselves for a brief moment and started looking for certain files they had brought with them. They continues to ask the other scientist basic questions until the other finally found the files he was looking for.He goes up to the Mic and says " As of right now based on the research Black African Males have the Highest Number of Known reported AIDs cases" That isnt word for word what he said but it was really in that ball park.Everything goes silent for a bit and then all of a sudden BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! RASISTS BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!Im confused really and trying to understand why they are booing.The Team on stage tries to Clarify with statistics taken at that time as well as the epidemic going on in Africa as well as the US. They have hard proof to back up everything they say but the crowd keeps booing really really hard.In the midst of all this I remember this one teacher who got a hold of the mic and took personal issues with what was said. Shes black and Ill say now she didnt deny anything of what they said but she said something I still remember to this day and I think is kinda fucked up." Black Men Sleep with alot of women because guess what Thats what makes them Men!" She got alot of applause for that. I looked at my Choir Teacher and I just say " Thats seems a little messed up way of thinking"He Replied " I didnt agree with her at all"For those that dont get it she basically said A Black man is only as Manly based on how many Women he can fuck. Which is really really a fucked up way of thinking but is really true in alot of black communities.After that the whole thing kinda faded and ended.If anyone has any questions feel free to ask.

"Stop!" she shouted.I lowered the BBQ sauce from her nipple. "Why?" I asked, slightly confused. She looked me straight in the eyes. I knew right then something big was coming. "I'm..." I braced myself for what was to come next."I'm vegan." I backed away in horror."No, no it can't be." She looked at me, eyes filled with sorrow."Yes, I'm afraid it is.""But... I gave you my meat!""No, that was my dogs mouth you put it in. The lights were off so you wouldn't realise."A tear rolled down my face."But you said you liked it!" I exclaimed. It was the best I'd ever had.She shook her head."I don't even know what it looks like."The shock took over my body as i stood rooted to the spot."Please know I am sorry. If you want, I can make you your favourite noodles today."I gave out a loud sigh."Alright."There was a moment of silence as we took the time to take it all in."Are you still hard?" she asked."Yes.""Perhaps I could...""No, you've done enough."I looked in dismay at her dog barking beside her."I think you should go, the dog and I need to finish what we started."Hoped you guys enjoyed this. Just a light chuckle to brighten anybody's day.

There is a monster who lives in my head.He�s small, and round, and yellow. He waddles around on his four stubby legs and almost always has a big smile on his face.When he is happy, that smile is sincere and he lets off a bright yellow glow everywhere he goes.When he is sad, that smile is pained and his glow dims to almost nothing.He walks around the darkness of my mind with nothing but his own glow to guide him.During the happy times his way is brightly lit and it is easy to get around.During the sad times he cannot see even his own feet and it is hard to take more than a step or two without tripping or bumping into something.During the happy times he gets happier. During the sad times he gets sadder.Luckily, the monster spends most of his time being happy. It made his life easier, and he never had much of a reason to be sad anyways.He wanders paths through the darkness of my brain, occasionally bumping into memories floating around my head.My sixth birthday.The monster stops a moment and watches as I, already wearing a toy fireman�s helmet and swinging around a plastic ax that I had unwrapped earlier, am told that my last present is waiting for me in the backyard.I eagerly threw down my ax and ran to the back door, my parents following with big smiles on their faces. There, waiting for me, was toy firetruck just the right size for a six year old to ride around in. My parents laughed as I, in my excitement, failed to open the door and tried to climb in through the window.The monster laughed with them. He glowed brighter. He liked this memory, it made him happy. He decided that he wanted to keep it with him always.The monster clumsily loaded the memory�a cube almost the same size as himself with my sixth birthday playing on repeat across all six of its faces�onto his back and began to walk again.He was glowing so brightly now that he could see almost as well as if it was noon day. He spotted another memory, bobbing low above the ground in the distance, and began to scurry towards it.This one was of a family vacation that we had taken the summer after I had finished elementary school. We had left early that morning and my parents had told me we were going to visit my uncle. They said it would be a long drive, so I should probably take a nap in the car. When I woke up we were pulling through the gates to the Disneyland parking lot. I was so excited.The monster stared, transfixed, at this much longer memory. When I, my parents, or my siblings looked especially happy he would laugh and his smile gradually grew bigger and bigger. He glowed brighter. He loved this memory even more than the first. After a short period of deliberation, he decided to set down the other memory and pick up this better one.And so his days stretched on. He continued to seek out new memories and, without fail, they would trump the one he had been carrying on his back. He would reverently set down the old memory and watch for a moment as it drifted away, then lift the new memory on his back and waddle off to find a new one.Eventually the monster came upon a sad memory. In the grand scheme of things it wasn�t really that sad, I had just had an argument with a friend at school and had gone off to eat lunch by myself. By the next day we had made up and everything was back to normal again, but for the monster this memory was shocking. It was different than anything he had seen before. His smile began to droop and he had to concentrate to keep it up. His light began to fade.Nevertheless, the monster, deciding that even though this memory was different than the others it still had to be important, continued with his normal ritual and gently set down the happy memory that had been on his back. He lifted the new memory, noticing that it was heavier than the others had been. He laboriously set off to find a new memory that would, hopefully, lighten his load.He wandered for a long time, both the heavy weight on his back and the dimming of his light making it harder to find new memories than it had been a moment before.The next memory he had found was sad, as was the next. With each new memory his light grew dimmer and the amount of time that it took to find a new memory grew longer.Eventually he stumbled upon another happy memory, but by then it was too late. Lifting the new, lighter memory on his back, he cursed the newfound strength with which his light glowed. This would only make it easier to find a new memory, and what if it was a bad one? He felt like he had a duty to give each new memory its due time on his back, so he wouldn�t be able to simply leave it where he found it. He began to hate being happy and look forward to the times when he was sad. When the world around him was dark and the weight on his back threatened to crush him he could at least console himself by saying, �at least it can�t get any worse than this.� When the world was bright and his weight was light he had no such assurance. To the contrary, his constant fear of what was to come made it impossible for him to enjoy the present.Luckily for the monster, there was no shortage of sad memories. It seemed as if more were added every day.The funeral of a friend who had died when driving through the canyon on a rainy night. The doctors had said that there was no alcohol or anything else in his blood, but even months later the rumors wouldn�t stop.A fight with my dad. I think I still have some of the smashed pieces of my iPod in a box in my closet.The first time I made my mom cry. I still agree with what I said then, which somehow only makes it worse.The monster watched each of these as he tried to maintain his fake smile. Occasionally a tear would leak out of his eyes and his glow faded until he was almost blind. His back ached, yet somehow he always had just enough sight to find the next memory and just enough strength to dutifully hoist it onto his back before setting off again.The monster continued pressing forward like this for years. As far as I know he still is to this day. There are other monsters in this world, though, and it is them that I would like to take a moment to talk about.&#x200B;There is a monster in my room. He is tall and rarely smiles.I said that this monster lives in my room, but, truth be told, it has been a long time since he has thought of himself as truly living. Existing? Yes. Subsisting? Yes. But living? Probably not.He goes about his daily life like it is one long to-do list. There is no reason behind his actions, they are simply the next thing to be done. Now he is at school, now work, now home. He tries to enjoy his free time, but ends up whiling it away as he waits until it is time to check of the next item on the list.Sometimes he is happy, sometimes he is sad, but most of the time he feels neutral, empty, emotionless.When he is sad he wants to be happy. When he is happy he is left wondering if it is okay for him to not be sad. When he is emotionless, he usually doesn�t notice. He just keeps checking the boxes.There are some things that he looks forward to. There are some things that he dreads. There are some people that he likes. There are some things that he fears. He tries not to let these things affect him and usually they don�t.One day he realized that that is not an acceptable way to live. Emotionless, burdened down, tired. He had isolated himself from the people around him and he knew that he couldn�t go on that way. He had to make a change, but he didn�t know how.And so he went through his days, checking off boxes on the list and looking for a way to get out of the self-imposed prison that had become his life.&#x200B;There is a monster who lives next door, too.She�s shorter than she would like and she thinks that she�s ugly (she�s not). She rides the bus to work and always tries to act more confident than she is.She likes books with lots of action and violence in them and hates texting.Sometimes she gets burdened down comparing herself to others and she thinks that they�re all better than her. Nevertheless, she continues to press on, always struggling to better herself. She sees visions of a bright and shining future, her goals met, her dreams fulfilled, and she continues to work harder than anyone else to one day see those dreams as a reality.People scare her sometimes because she feels like she doesn�t understand them. She has a hard time making friends. She doesn�t let that get in her way. She keeps striving.I have no idea where she gets the energy and, some days, she doesn�t know either.Nevertheless, she doesn�t give up.&#x200B;She has a monster who lives in her head, too. I don�t know very much about it. It�s probably round too, or maybe pyramid shaped. Maybe it has four legs, like mine, or maybe two, or three, or six.Does her monster smile when it�s sad too? What color does her monster glow?What memories has her monster bumped into on its long journey through the dark roads of her mind?Is her monster just as tired and worn down as my own?There�s a lot that I don�t know about her monster, but I do know one thing.One day, I want our monsters to meet. Maybe then they can finally put down the baggage they�ve been carrying for so long. Maybe then neither of them will have to force a smile ever again.Maybe�

When the sky is painted in the pastel shades of an amber sunrise, I awake from curious dreams with the notion of unimportance; any difference made is certainly not one deriving from good intentions. Unlike my colleagues, I am not blessed with a vaingloriously swollen stomach like that of a pig after finishing the last of its swill. If my line of work was a necessity, then perhaps I would feel different. But it isn�t and therefore I don�t. Most view it through the same lens as putting down an elderly dog. A means to an end.His words hover in my peripheral like ethereal locusts that refuse to be brushed aside. They are etched into my consciousness. Carved into the monolith of my being. A reminder of our courage. A reminder of our pride. They recount our collective heroism in service to our people. If this is heroism, then cowardice is unfathomable for that is all I am able to see when I can bare to look in the mirror to greet an unfamiliar face. A husk that is void of all that made him worth saving. Stripped of all that made him worthy of redemption and without the gumption to change. The equal tortures of his soul are reaching out in order to mend what cannot be mended, and with every failed attempt they only grow more desperate Who is he to dance between the lines of morality when his brothers and sisters in impermanence must face his dismal consequence? From this position of ivory, I am able to recall a cloudy childhood punctuated by such ideas.The boy flounders through a field of grass freshly cut. With milky eyes running down cheeks of redness raw, he holds a string loosely in one hand and its coil in the other. Impossible laughter sails a kite through the waveless sea that is the summer sky. And as the sun sinks behind a blanket of western hills, the boy gazes upon the kite and the kite gazes back. I wish I could speak to the child. I wish I could warn him to release the kite for the kite is an omen. An ungodly warning of his own captivity. Today he cannot flounder through a field of grass freshly cut for he is not free. He is a prisoner in his own right and he is chained to their cause.No longer can one sail a waveless sea. No longer is it tranquil. It now writhes and shrieks and damns me to a place of incomprehensibility. Her innocence stains my eyelids like a fine wine spilled over cotton. A deep crimson infused with the fibres of my being. Her hair was sunlight and in that brief moment in which time stood still the low-lying embers of my life were rekindled. Yet physically she was ghastly. A dying flame in the midst of darkness. She was a scarecrow picked apart by the very thing she was created to deter. Some archaic relic from a time rich in irony. Her shapeless body only exemplified the extremity of her mortality. She was an offering to some ancient deity. A virgin sacrifice. Her empty eyes were blackholes and deep within her irises shone stars infinitely bright. A perfect imperfection.Called forth by the shimmering twilight, my psyche is burdened with the impossibility of stitching itself back together. Entire lives are spent attempting to catch the attention of the gods who govern us, screaming at the doorstep of the hypothetical. Yet when I was greeted by the god of death, I was compelled to turn my face, refusing to meet his gaze. For the first time in my tragically unexplainable existence I had found meaning in the meaningless. That newfound sense of an optimistic nihilism haunts me to this day. It shall continue to haunt me until I leave this plain of reality, and until such a day finds me, I shall greet it as a friend.The calmness of the night sky is reflected upon the glassy lake in which I scatter the ashes of hope. The universe holds its breath as I am released from the unforgiving grasps of grief, if only for a single second, for I have lost the last of my humanity. I watch silently as my essence mixes with the infinite cosmos, dirtying it with the impurity of my being, and now I must journey with a sombreness much too heavy to bare. Alone at last, I take the opportunity to reflect. I look with hindsight into a past that is grey in hue; any splash of colour is silenced by the volume of the mundane.�Are you okay?��Yes.��You barely touched your food.��I�m okay.��Okay.�I brush the crumbs from the corners of my mouth and look down at a plate half full. Buttered bread and sausage. Egg yolk swimming in the cracks in the ceramic. There is more food there than I will need, yet I am determined to finish it anyway. I tense my grip around my fork and bring it to the partition in my lips, only to chase it with coffee freshly brewed. Dissociated, I rise from the table balancing a head filled with feelings that I cannot possibly articulate. Formless words swimming in an empty sea. As a product of my environment why do I feel so separated from it? I march with Wilhelm. Disjointed images of boyhood flash through my mind like that of a poorly animated flipbook. The personification of my own virtue had crumbled in its foundations of belief. Burdened with the promise of an idealistic future he followed the regime blindly like a monk in search of Nirvana. This is the man he was fated to become. And what of myself? Am I destined to meet the same fate? If not, then what remains to separate us? Either I break the chain or continue to live as its strongest link.I hold my rifle loosely barely registering the shuffling mass of cargo before me. A room of tile completely barren if not for the long baskets that line the walls.Take off your clothes.Skeletal children cover their naked bodies in shame. Faces drawn with the lines of age lose their composure only to be calmed by the fresh faces of ignorance. I have long since forgotten what disturbs me more.They are marched through double doors into a metal box and rammed together like kine. If this is the word of God, then our God is one unjust.Ready?Yes.Flashes of both humanity and a lack thereof it. How can I continue down this path when it is cobbled with such stark sorrow? I grip the switch limply. I want to run. I want to feel the grass between my toes as the kite sails once more through a placid sea. Hauntings of anguish mock all that remains.I cannot pull the switch. My ideologies beg me to search for my sense of altruism, for I am the god of death and must choose between my life or theirs. I cannot pull the switch.Yet I pull it all the same.*�Monsters exist, but they are too few in number to be truly dangerous. More dangerous are the common men, the functionaries ready to believe and to act without asking questions.�*\- *Primo Levi, Holocaust Survivor*

One day when I was 15 years old my dad drove me to pick up my best friend(we will call him Leon) . After we picked Leon up my dad said he needed to get gas because he was almost out. So we stopped by one of our local gas stations, but when we got there my dad asked if one of us wanted to pump the gas. My friend Leon quickly volunteered bragging that he does it all the time and loves to pump gas. Odd flex I know. Anyways my dad said �go ahead Leon I�m going to go to the bathroom cut it off at 30 dollars.� So my dad proceeded to go inside the store and Leon started pumping the gas. I�m standing right next him watching because believe it or not I�d never really pumped gas before. I wanted to get this divine educational experience and learn from �the best�, which was apparently Leon. Leon is pumping the gas and pump is creeping toward 30 dollars. When the 30 dollar mark finally arrives Leon pulls the gas nozzle out he doesn�t take his hand off the part that makes the gas come out. Gas is going everywhere. Leon is holding the handle in shock, panicking, not knowing how to get it to stop. He�s spraying the side of the truck, the ground, straight up in the air, etc. There�s an older black man in a truck behind us in the pump line yelling �YOU GOTTA TURN IT LOOSE, TURN IT LOOSE PLAY BOY!�. Leon and I to be honest had no idea what that even meant so gas kept coming out like a vicious water hose. My dad finally arrived to save the day. Once we got back in the truck and rode down the road in silence for a bit my dad said �Yeah that�s not happening again Leon.� We all laughed. This story is pretty funny told in person due to the voice the man behind us had when saying �TURN IT LOOSE� like wtf does that mean??? To this day every once and a while we just randomly say �TURN IT LOOSE PLAY BOY� lol. I hope you all enjoyed. Have a great day!

I never had a girlfriend or boyfriend before, and, as all my friends are getting married, I decided I�d take it upon myself to get myself some action.  I�d never cared if it was with a girl or a guy, and I heard about Grindr from that time that Muslim guy catfished a bunch of gay guys at a night club.  It made the news I think.  Now, I�m a very well-known guy in my community � Treasurer of my church actually � so I obviously couldn�t put my face in my profile picture.I had 2Pac abs so I put that as my profile picture.  Yes, I ran forty five minutes at my gym every month.  At first, I didn�t get any messages so I started messaging people.  None of the cute 18 year olds were messaging me back so I finally decided to open up my filters to see all the profiles.  And I was like HOLY SHIT, I saw my damn near naked cousin on Grindr!I learned that he had a fetish for knocking people out and touching them while they�re sleeping.  I had slept over at his house countless times.

As a kid I did the classic 'wake up on Saturday and watch cartoons, and never alone. I'm an only child who always had friends but never over during the morning, the real ones at least. I always had an almost see-through with reddish, almost scarlet colored eyes and a wide mouth. He was about 6'1" and never talked. He only communicated through tapping, but it was not Morse code (huge g i Joe fan so I would have known).Anyways, he only appeared during those Saturdays where I enjoyed it. He started to appear in other places though. School, in the classroom and at night, outside my window. Now might be a good time to say it wasn't built human.  This.. thing had 7 arms/ legs, claw marks down its chest and between its eyes. Now that that it clarified,  back to him. He appeared more frequently,and he got more aggressive. He started erratically banging instead of tapping, no more smiles as he watched over me, and he became... *static.*I no longer felt safe. He was everywhere. *was.* I haven't seen him since 2009, around this time. I no longer see him in everyday life, but only dreams. He is in almost every dream I have, standing in the background or something like that.I wish this wasn't true. I really do. This **thing** keeps me up. I still wonder why I saw/ see this thing everywhere. He also warns me in the number 7. always 7. Does any one knows what it means?Sorry for formatting or misspelling, as I've been up for almost 40 hours as of now.

I just found this subreddit because I want to share a story about what happened in the past lessons. I would like to apologize for grammar mistakes and potential non-sense (if I write any) that I'm about to write.So me and my friend (let's call him Noah) willingly signed up for coding club and it's actually my first time I'm using my free time on school related events. I was a bit scared when it was time for coding club since the only guys I knew was Noah and another friend of his. Also I was absent in the first 2-3 lessons because I needed to change my schedule so I could make room for coding club, therefore I may have missed a few important coding stuff.Lesson 1: I entered the classroom and told the teacher about why we were absent and he was cool about it. After that I had to choose a seat and wanted to sit next to Noah, but he sat next to the other friend to catch up with the coding, little did he he would be sitting there forever. So I sat next to a random dude and thought that he would assist me with coding whenever I needed help.Nope, I have never seen him code by himself, he only played krunker.io and ROBLOX with his seat neighbors and never got caught. That's pretty shit, I wonder how he's still in the club. Luckily I quickly learned the code by myself and that's all for lesson 1.Lesson 2: First we learned a line of code and then we had a little "mini-contest" with 2 tasks. Somehow I got 2nd place and I feel pretty proud  of myself of someone who got absent a few times. During "mini contest", winners were allowed to help others. I helped a few including Noah, who's still clueless about what we're supposed to do (honestly I had a bit of trouble teaching others, because I'm not very good at explaining and I just started coding).Then this dude asked for help and I went to him. I looked at the code and error logs and asked what was wrong about it. He immediately admitted that while I was helping others, he went to my PC, opened the file, took a photo of the code, closed the file, and went back to his PC and then asked why his copied code wasn't working. I was pissed from the inside but calm from the outside. I asked why he did it, however received no response.I helped him with "his" code and then my seat neighbors wanted to copy my code aswell, because.. well.. you know if you paid attention.I let them copy but I closed the file mid way.10 mins before lessons ended and winners were allowed to play games. I got on https://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight/ and wanted to show Noah a cool website, since he also plays Undertale.I went to him and told him to come, then all of a sudden I saw a dude, probably older than me playing the game on my PC without my permission.After he was done playing, he returned to his PC. I was confused and then tried to search for a browser game that is completely obscure. I ended up playing nothing and lessons ended. In conclusion, coding good, club member shit.

A few months ago I went to  Walgreens to get some medicine for my little brother. At the time my mom was out if town and my dad working. So i took my brother with me( we were home but decided to take him to the doctor).  As I walk in theres a well dressed guy standing by the door. He says nothing.I didn't have much money just enough to pay for the medicine (we had some expenses so we were kinda limited) . I end up with like a dollar all in coin change. I carry my brother with his blanket and leave and i feel a tap on my back.The well dressed guy puts a paper really close to my face and says- i need money, do you have any moneyTo which i answer- just some spare changeHe says okI give him 50 cents and he looks at me with an angry look. I felt like he was gonna scream at me. to which i was freaking out bc my little brother in my arms , and not many people around.He shows me the paper again and says that he was just out of jail and needed money. Im like well i dont have much i just took my brother to the doctor and paid medicines. He says.- Well ive been in jail and i have no money so please give me five dollars.This time i say i have nothin and i start to walk away towards my car, i felt his presence behind me. I put my brother in the car and i jump from the back seats to the drivers seat. The guy taps my window and says give me five dollars. He keeps tapping, i start the car and he backs a bit enough for me to get out. He follows a bit through the lot and then i lost sight of him once i entered the main street.I never told my parents about it bc even my brother didn't notice, he was sleepy and tired. Days later I see the guy again on a trail while driving with a cousin . The guy dressed all dirty and old clothes. My cousin then tells me he was in jail bc of breaking in some homes. And also selling drugs. And he had really bad attitudes toward people who dont give him money. After that i never saw him again, neither has my cousin. It honestly felt scary bc i once got jumped by some drug addicts that wanted me to "try that good sh#t" Is not an amazing or interesting story but here it is. Thanks for reading

Oh boy.Bad news. I just came in contact with a level of stupid that I thought was only present on talk shows. Today, I conversed with perhaps the most misguided person I�ve ever met. She tried to convince me that males were unnecessary. She was talking about synthetic sperm and that soon men will be a thing of the past. I thought she was joking until a full 30 seconds of silence convinced me otherwise. Being furious and not wanting to bring up an argument of eradicating another gender, I decided not to bring up the - equally as inevitable - invention of synthetic eggs, instead I made a joke out of it saying �Wait? But then who�s going to make an income and pay for your shoes?� Juvenile? Yes. True for this particular girl? Yes. It�s balanced out.I decided that I would bring up synthetic eggs only if this cunt decided to dig herself deeper into the hole of radical ideology. Luckily, that didn�t happen. However, it didn�t happen because one of the other girls at the table threw a water bottle at me. Dickhead.I�m still mad about this. I know I�m an asshole, but at least I�m not a proponent that bullshit.

In the dumps and in the rumps of the big city, the man shivered with bucket in hand waiting for someone to offer a buck or 2. He was once a big guy now shriveled to his bones. He had a wife, a daughter, but now he spends his time waiting for something to happen in his desolate life. He's got a guitar that he shakily plays. He plays all day till he gets money for food, something to nourish him for the week. He hasn't had a home cooked meal in forever, but he works towards it. He was once a druggie in the decade of splendor. For all the good stuff, he'd be a vendor. He'd sell to those that look alot like him in his future days.After 10 years of faking his music degree, his spouse finds out all the shenanigans he's been up to. He searches for an excuse to cover up his enterprise, but falls shallow. He gets kicked out and told that he can't see his daughter ever again. He swears on his life that he would never do the deed anymore. That he would indeed fix himself so he wouldn't hurt her again. He wanted his daughter back oh so much. The beauty of her eyes that brought him closer. The warmth of her hugs that gave him so much comfort. The playful nature that would get him into a joyous mood. All of it taken from him because of his sinful career. He just wanted to provide her with the care she needed, all the money from his,"Studio's", revenue that payed for all of her needs. He just wanted a bright future for his little girl. Now he spends his days on the street, using his old lies to make his own nourishment to last him through the day.He plays all day and all night to pay his dues. Not a single day without a meal, luckily, but not a single one with a home either. After many years of playing he stopped trying to get money, he accepted his position a slept on the street for a long time.But One day he got a home, a big spacious place that was all white beautiful and lively. The neighborhood had streets of a golden tint with houses white as old. The neighbors were very nice but pretty busy considering they were always flying form one place to the next. All of the neighbors shared his beliefs which made it nicer to talk to them. There were no rainy days in his new life, no sadness, no grief, for it was a place that was pretty neat.But one thing was surehe could never be curedBecause He had died

  Part 2 is out.... https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/dtgxic/the_only_story_i_have_worth_telling_the_best/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareI have lived a life, taken my fair share of risks and taken passes on others, but I�ve always felt that I really only have one story worth telling. I usually speak this story and I�m not entirely sure if this will translate well into text without my gesticulation, intonation, and other impressive ��ation� words that make this story so great. That being said, strap in, its gunna be a long one.There are three things I�d like to preface prior to starting my story. Three, very specific relationships that, through the years, have shaped, and ultimately solidified the man who I�ve become. I want you particularly familiar with these persons, as the impact of each of these individuals is pivotal to the story.The first of three, is the relationship I have with my father. To say our relationship has always been rocky is akin to accusing Fuji of being a mole hill. Looking back, I can acknowledge the fact that my father did the best he knew how, but without a real reference for fatherhood, he just sort of, missed the mark. His relationship with his father wasn�t exactly the most open either. More pointedly, his dad was sparsely around, if at all. I feel for my dad; what else can you do to raise a son when you raised yourself? Unfortunately, our relationship is just one of those cases where you do everything as well as you�re able to, and still have absolutely nothing to show for it.As far back as I can remember I have been scared of my father. He was the disciplinary force of the household and I wasn�t exactly the most well behaved kid. Nothing crazy, I�ve just always been a social chameleon. You know, the kind that shifts themselves into whatever disposition the situation dictates, just to be a friendly face and what not. Well, as you can imagine, with that trait, I talked a lot in school. Like, A LOT, a lot. Now, my father has always had this rule: if you get in trouble at school you get in trouble at home. And boooooy did I get in trouble at school. Mind you, I�m not talking high school (Though I did get into my fair share of trouble.) I�m talking about elementary school. From seconds grade and up. The formative years.I had a hard time rationalizing why I was getting into trouble simply for being who I was. While on the other hand, my father had a hard time rationalizing why I simply couldn�t just follow the rules. Either way, being as young as I was, and with the inability on either of our parts to communicate, the circumstances just sorta lent themselves to this emotional barrier between us, that eventually cleaved itself into an irreparable chasm as time trudged on. It happens I suppose. The point being, that for the entire duration of my life, my father was emotionally unavailable and frustrated that he couldn�t convey his emotions to his children. We rarely if ever spoke, unless I was doing chores or being yelled at for whatever trouble I was getting myself into. Though, I digress, I just hope you get the point.The second relationship is that of a man I truly respect, in every facet of the word. My best friend in the whole wide world, Chase. We�ve known each other since we were 11 (Currently 27 and 28) and spent most of our lives getting in to, and out of, varying levels of trouble.It�s funny how friendship slowly seeps into the crannies of your life. First you�re on the outside wondering when, or if, you�ll get passed the xbox controller. Then one day you�re in middle school, getting chased by a killer dog down Hacha Road. Next thing you know, you�re climbing your high school to piss on Mrs. Gibbson�s window in the dead of winter, all because it seemed like a good idea at the time. Another fast forward and you find yourself teary-eyed, face to face with the man atop an overpass in Lubbock, Texas, wondering who�s going to take the first swing. Then, one day BOOM! Baby announcements. It has, and continues to be, a truly wide ride.It�s a welcome thought that in this moment, I can look back on what slings and arrows I�ve suffered, and can confidently say that Webster�s ain�t got shit to tell me about the definition of friendship. Metals were tested, storms were weathered, great times were had by all, and both he and I, are better men for it. I have always said that there are few things I know with absolute certainty, and of those things: the sun is bright, water is wet, and Chase is my best friend in the whole. Wide. World.Now before we hit preface three I should mention: Since before I can remember, I have ALWAYS wanted to be in love. That being said, lets continue.As you know, I grew up avoiding my father, which meant I spent a lot of time attached to my mother or my two sisters. Which, of course meant years of Disney movies and the overly-compensated cultivation of a hopeless romantic side, within myself. (Daddy issues, go figure.) I took this and fuggin� ran with it. I would talk adamantly about love any chance I was given. I was the single guy that somehow gave great advice to dating couples. (Humble too.) Above all, I believed, so fervently, in the significance of the love I had to give. When you�re young that�s all you want: to love, and be loved in return. I spent years, decades, devoting myself to this craft. (I was 22 at the time so it technically counts) I knew the things to say to make knees waiver; the things that make a heart race, or skip a beat. I cultivated a charm, so profound it�s honestly one of my favorite attributes about my current self. I�m still working on the humility, but I�m sure I�ll get to it, eventually. I knew what it meant to be Prince Charming and I was enthralled with the idea of being that for someone. I worked tirelessly to that end. Soon enough, there, in the culmination of all those years invested into formulating this concrete ideology of love, stood Kelley.Saying I loved Kelley is an understatement. I was obsessed with this girl, and looking back I know for sure this wasn�t what love is, at all. Which is kind of why I enjoy this story so much. It serves as such a great reminder of who I am, and why I have come to be this way. Back to the point!I loved Kelley with reckless abandon. I loved her with the, ever-so-intoxicating, na�ve zeal reserved for the inexperienced, or truly crazy. With every fiber of by being, did I invest myself into this woman, and in the end it�s just another example of trying your best and ending up with nothing but a story to tell. Our relationship was rocky, and had always been. We met when she was a freshman and I a senior in high school. We were in band, so the intermingling of the grades was just expected.Funny aside, I met her because she stashed her trumpet in my cubby the first day of summer band. I shouted across the band hall �Who�s shit is in my cubby??� Imagine my surprise when a doey-eyed freshman meekly approached me. I vividly remember her eyes. They were innocent, and very vibrant, piercing green. They turn even more beautiful when she cries, but that�s kind of a shitty point to make. I�m doing this off recollection because I haven�t seen her in 5 years, but i do recall that she was shorter than me. Being 5�9� I�d put her around 5�5�, 5�4� ish. Wavy blonde hair that really couldn�t decide between being a windblown wheat field on a beautiful summer day, or being akin to the vibrant coat of a purebred golden retriever named Boo, because Chases parents got the dog around Halloween. Either way, Kelley was beautiful, captivating even. What�s more important-er, is that she was the first girl to make me truly believe in �ever after�. Which, you can imagine was a significant milestone in the development of my Charming Prince, persona. Admittedly, its a melancholy realization to discover that those who spur the passion in our hearts, the most, are not always those with whom we spend our lives, but hey, what can you do.As the years passed we were on and off, until 2013 around summer. I graduated 2010. Then I asked her to be my girlfriend, she said yes, and the rest is a hodgepodge of terrible decisions that ultimately lead to the demise of a potentially life-long love.These are them. Those of whom I hold responsible for creating me. They are the scissors, needle, and thread that weavethe rest of this story. Thanks for reading.As a sendoff, might I say: I am fully aware that there�s nothing that can be said in a few paragraphs to fully envelope the complexities and depth of any of these relationships. Had I the words to let you fully understand what these relationships mean to me I�d tell you a hundred times over. That being impossible, I leave you with this: What I am today and who I aim for my son to be, was founded on these three key people in my life. I am a more refined man for having experienced what I have, and my son will be better. God I look forward to seeing him shine.Alright strangers, we�re at 1625 words and counting. This was super long, she said that, and I don�t really want to type all this out if no one�s going to look at it. So I�m stopping here and if enough interest is generated I will tell you my story. Until then.TL:DR: There are 3 really significant people in my life that play key roles in a story a have yet to tell.

I had this German teacher who would always try and get me to talk in class and would frequently ask me to talk to him about my 'work'. I was an average student and I wasnt even that good at German but he would always compliment my work. He would also constantly come to my table and talk to us about how we liked german and stuff. When I chose my options he got really sad I didnt choose the subject and kept telling me I had to move. He would also always touch my arm or leg to get my attention. Which I reported. It got to one point where he was telling a teacher about me and said the exact dates I misbehaved. Finally some actions were taken against him and he confessed that he liked me in that way and wouldve wanted to move forward. He got sacked and is facing a minor jail time

This is a story of perhaps the most chaotic good thing I've ever seen. I was at a Halloween party about an hour ago. I was dressed as spider-man, and my friend was dressed as Captain Falcon, with the mask, helmet, and everything. It was honestly pretty impressive. This guy has trained in MMA for several years, this will be relevant later. So anyway, some douche dressed as Freddie Mercury has a few too many drinks and starts stumbling around being an asshole and causing trouble. He eventually approached Captain Falcon, and said something I could't hear. Captain Falcon tells Freddie to back off. Freddie puffs out his chest and yells "You wanna go?" Captain Falcon drops into a fighting stance and yells "Show me your moves" just like in Super Smash. Freddie throws a drunken punch at him. Captain falcon easily ducks under it, yells "Falcon Kick!" and roundhouse kicks Freddie in the side of the head knocking him flat on his back unconscious. He then grabs my arm and says, "We gotta go" and we both run out to my car and peel out of the driveway.

So I used to play this game called Pok�mon TCG online and I met this guy named Kyle, he was very cool and we became friends quickly, we talked everyday, he was my childhood best friend. One day, he told me he was having surgery and he wouldn�t be on for a few days, he promised he�d be back on, I guess the game sent notifications, cause a week later after that, he hadn�t been on for a month, then 3 months, then a year, I still check to this day and he hasn�t been on yet. I�m still sad to this day, he was my best friend.

Felt the need to write this because I still feel really bad. Long story short...Our class starts at 8:25 p.m and It's around 8 p.m. on a Wednesday night. Here I am sitting with my classmate talking as we usually do before class and have really great conversations about many things. She was doing her homework in the midst of talking to me and another classmate. Me being a person who has terrible jokes and makes these awful jokes as a way to I guess avert a bit of empathy or just get the other person to laugh. Except, I'm the one usually laughing at my own jokes. It's sad, I know. Anyways, 10 mins pass by and it's 8:10 and the class is going to begin in 15 minutes. The homework is due in 5 mins. The other classmate is helping her with the homework while I'm just jabbering. She finishes the homework on time and then started to do some previous classwork, which was minor. I told her, in a joking way, that she's a great friend and that I would've just said go home. I was just pulling her leg but I think she took it seriously. Me and the other classmate were heading to class but she was still writing and said I'll join you guys later when I'm done. So we're sitting in class and the class starts and she didn't come. 10 minutes pass by and the classmate tells me she left. At that point I felt really bad because I think I might have influenced her decision to go home and not attend the class. The class that day was the most easiest one yet as we just sat there and did group work and listened to a Spanish song. It would've been great if she attended and didn't miss class cause of what I said. I don't want anyone doing bad cause of me or the things I say but don't really mean. *sigh*

Im from England,In 1995,At the young age of four, I had an imaginary friend who wore a black cloak and had a white beak, he would walk with a caine and would have a white bag around his shoulder.I saw him every single night, henwould try to heal me, make me feel well.I have a terminal illness that is slowly killing me.I didn't think much of it at that time, until I turned 24, he had haunted me for 20 years.Little did I understand that it was the bloody plague doctor.I would see him everywhere,often when my bedroom light was off.Clicking from his Caine would echo in the living room room stairs; as if he was looking for me.I couldnt understand as to why he was constantly interested in me, why me?. Why am I so important that he has and had to of followed me my whole life.But it doesn't too bother me much; I just cope with it, he has become a major part of my life, when I was bullied in 2016 he was there and would sit at the end of my bed and lie down with me.(some may find it creepy)I would feel and see the bed make a dint in the covers and mattress.No one else can see him, so no one believes me, except my dog who barks and will not enter my bedroom on her own.It makes me think that he is trying to 'cure' me of this deadly illness.I would have nightmares of when they would cut limbs off people who had the plague, or smallpox.I saw the limbs, being cut off with a saw; I heard the screams off the victims and the fear it exposed to many around the world.Secretly I think it's to do with a past life.My nan also, I could be right, considering how long he has been with me.I'm not worried..I never have been.

\*Based on a true story\*YouTube Audio Version:[https://youtu.be/C3aZLA-qYB8](https://youtu.be/C3aZLA-qYB8)So today I have a very odd story for you guys. It takes place back in high school in the beginning of my sophomore year before I got expelled, which you can check out in my last video (or reddit page). At this time I was 16 years old. Just hitting puberty, beginning manhood, and just trying to find out who I was as a person. In the first week, I made some new friends that i didn't know from my freshman year. Which in high school, I loved meeting people, you never know who may turn into your best friend. And that's what I was looking for, a best friend. Someone who can be odd and goofy just like me. And I thought I found one. I had a pretty good friend in my history class. She was pretty cute, had a awesome personality, and was short (which is not a bad thing at all, keep in mind). Now I wasn't trying to turn my friend into a girlfriend or anything but whatever happens, happens.A few weeks go by and we get closer. Knowing a little more about each other and being able to relate quite a bit to one another. And she finally invites me over to meet her family. Which I obviously accepted. Now at this time I wasn't even sure she liked me in that way. I wasn't really looking for a relationship anyways. That evening after school I head straight over to her place. Her friend ended up dropping us off at her house and I was going to get a ride home by my mother afterwards. When we arrived I realized this girls parents are loaded. A beautiful marble fountain in the middle of their yard with a round about like driveway. But thats not all, she lived in a mansion.... like what. Really didn't expect pulling up to this. But we hop out of the car and head inside to meet her parents. Right when you walk through the front door, there's a beautiful crystal chandelier above you and a staircase on the right. We make our way upstairs to her moms room. And I meet her beautiful mom. Like wow, I might have to marry her mom and not her. She greets me and says that shes happy that her daughter, which we will name Sandra, found a new friend. As she doesn't have many friends. I thought this was weird. A cute rich white girl that has an amazing house, but no friends. She had to be crazy or something. It just didn't feel right that she was so lonely, she was cute and had an amazing personality, who would pass that up, even just being friends.Her mom was very trusting of Sandra or maybe didn't even care but she let us both in Sandra's room with the door shut. Thankfully, she had a PS4 and two controllers so we wouldn't be too bored. To not make it awkward I turn on the PS4 and load up Black Ops 4. As we are playing zombies shes telling me a bit about her life. She says her father figure left years ago and it as just her and her mom living there. Which I could relate to so we shared stories. Somehow the subject goes from 0 to 100 and shes talking about what she likes in a guy. Now, I'm sitting on her bed thinking "Is she tryna get with me or something? Why is she telling me this....?" She says, I like a man with a beard and he HAS to be dominant." And let me tell you, she stressed that he had to be dominant, without me saying anything.  Then she says "But he has to be into the same things I'm into, no exceptions".  When someone says that, of course you have to ask. So I ask, "What are you into..?"She explained that I'm not going to get it and think its weird. I assure her that It's fine and I doubt I would be. I reassure her by saying shes beautiful and has such an outgoing personality, It can't be that weird. She moves closer to me and rests her head on my shoulder and tells me that she can count on me and trusts me. Her secret then comes out.... Well, when I'm in bed I like to role play she says. Role play? Like what? She then states that she likes to dress up as a furry. Oh man, what did I get myself into. I couldn't resist to laugh. She kinda gets upset with me but then I ask her "What do you dress up as" I couldn't say it with a straight face.This girl tells me that she doesn't dress up as a fox, dog, or cat but a MOUSE. A FREAKING MOUSE. SHE WANTED ME TO CHASE HER LIKE TOM CHASING JERRY AROUND UNTIL I GOT THAT SWEET ASS. LIKE WHAT.  Now if you guys don't know me, I'm far from into that furry stuff. I thought it was just a meme. I didn't know people actually enjoyed it. I bust out laughing, not trying to hold it in anymore and apologize. I tell her I'm definitely not into that at all. And from the look on her face, she was hoping I was. It became very awkward and I ended up texting my mom to come get me. This all happened within an hour of me getting dropped off. I kinda felt rude but at the same time, what are you supposed to do in that situation? I feel like If I showed somewhat of interest or tried to understand where she was coming from, she would've tried to hop onto me. Moral of the story, Don't judge a book by its cover. When you open it, there may be things you didn't wanna know. From that day on, we never talked about her interests again and we strictly became school friends.Thanks for sticking around and listening/reading to another one of crazy life stories.

We are the unwanted.The unneeded.Even though we have friends and laugh with them and claim to be happy,we are one in the same.we share something we don't want yet we hold so dearly.Loneliness.we hold on to this even when we are in the company of people we consider friends.Lost but yet never found.Year after year we fall, deeper and deeper down this inescapable rabbit hole.we so desperately want to rid ourselves of this burden but we can't and even if we could, we wouldn't be able to function without it. Just stay,It will all be over soon.



******************************



You know not of my existence.I blend into the crowd.I watch and observe everything.I celebrate every single one your accomplishments no matter how small or irreverent they may be to you.No good action goes unnoticed.when you're sad, i'm sad.When you're happy, everything wrong in life seems to dissipate into nothing.You know not of my existence.Yes, we cross paths and share common laughs and smiles but i'm still the unknown in your eyes.I can't expect you to understand this madness!I can't explain in words how when you are alone for so long, you grow numb towards everything but when you see someone actually happy, with an actual good and pure heart, it pains you to see them sad, angry, alone.You don't know I exist but from our little talks, laughs, and just your smile lifts my pain and numbness- it brings me back to a time where I could just smile for the hell of it.You know not of my existence but the little we have together means the absolute world to me.

The first week of school.Bleak, dreary, and grey.Much of me had dread the reopening of school. I was in my final year so the end was already in sight; Just barely out of reach. I go about my days with my headphones on to drown out the noises of a world that was real. That world was really not something I wanted to be too involved with.I have my elective class every Wednesday. This class was unlike the others. In this class, there are new people. However, to me, it didn't matter. Different faces, same shit. I walked into class, get my attendance and I look around and notice that some of my classmates from the main class were with me so I sit with them, give them a smile and a nod before going back into my zone.The teacher goes over her introduction, class rules, assignments, what is expected, how we'll be graded, the importance of this cl- I stand up and excuse myself to go to the bathroom. I walked out the class and standing out in the hallway was a girl. Thick, beautiful, dark blue tipped hair with bright eyes that seemed lost. We made eye contact and I pay her a half-smile and her clueless expression quickly changed to a smile that could light up the darkest of caves. I approach her and asked if she was lost."Um... Do you know where is class #3-04?""It's right where I just came from."She lets out a nervous chuckle before heading off my opposite direction. I turn back to get another glimpse of her before continuing on to do my business with a gentle smile that couldn't be wiped off.I get back and see that she's sitting across the class from me. She noticed me and threw another smile towards me. I kindly returned the acknowledgement. Little did I know then that that was going to be our moment. The teacher calls her out for being late. Gracie... So that's her name.From then on, I would walk into class every Wednesday regardless of how tired or sick I was. I wanted to be there. I just knew I had to be there. All for just five seconds in a two hour class. Just for me to be sitting at my desk and waiting for our moment. The moment where from across the class, through everyone in between, to look into each other's eyes and just smile.Last week, I was feeling down because I had been having bad days consecutively. I was crammed with homework and part time work along with helping my parents out. I stepped into class having actually forgotten about the Wednesday Girl. The class went on for a while before I decided to look up from stressing about all the things in my life. In that moment, everything faded. The world around me went blank. All I could see was Gracie and I remembered about her and our moment. All I wanted to see was her. She let out the smile she had always done. But this time, it struck me hard. I lost my cool. In a moment of purest emotion, my mouth and heart took control and let out a ridiculous smile that stretched from ear to ear and a familiar nervous chuckle. I turned away to regain my composure while she lets out a cheeky grin at how I reacted. The story ends here with a guy smitten by a simple smile.May be continued.

So I live in a small town in Ontario Canada I have lived in this town for about 15 years I have seen many strange things but the strangest is dispiring people I'm not talking about missing people either in talking about you see somebody walking and then they vanish I have seen it multiple times but every encounter is the same it's somebody walking or biking or skateboarding and I have never seen them in the town before just today my mom witnessed it so I know I'm not crazy we went to pick up a pizza and we come down our road we live on mind you this is a long straight road so you can easily tell where some one went as we pulled in the driveway I said to my mom watch hes just gunna vanish and my mom didn't believe me we got out of the car and he's gone we know all are naibours and he just vanished evey encounter is the same somebody that has never been seen in the town before and when you see them they just smile and look at your then there gone and I can't seem to find any history of unusual deaths expect for 1 in 1946 when I boy caught fire so I'm just at a lost it doesn't scare me any more as I see one of the vanishing people about once a month but I'm just curious if any body else has ever witnessed something like this before

So I'm waiting for an appointment at the moment and what better use of my time is posting an extremely embarrassing time when I got caught watching porn at my school library in 5th grade So my private school has offered trips overseas and makes students pay a ridiculous amount of money for as long as I've been there. To take advantage of it I made an agreement with my parents that I could get $500 for every trip I missed. (Which was once a year).I think at the time I was 10 years old and I learnt about sex really early through TV and videogames as well as my curiousity. I wasn't a weird perverted kid but I went through the whole phase of wanting to watch porn for fun and not for other shit kinda fascinating for some reason.I always got scared of watching porn at home in fear of being caught but for some reason my dumbass yet kinda smart found a way to watch it at school.So basically during the school trip I stayed back at school with a bunch of other kids and a black kid in my class who was pretty nice in general offered to log into the library computer with his login for me since I lied that mine didn't work.I then logged into his computer and went back to my computer and since it was my first time searching further than a victoria secret christmas bikini I immediately jumped to celebrities. Did I also mention that the computers were in front of a large window in which many parents and teachers walked past?Surprisingly I got away with it for 2 months every day. I found it enjoyable for some reason at the time not doing anything else than look at naked women and sex.This quickly changed on a car ride with my parents telling me they got called by the school and they were recieving a printout of my search history.The next day I was panicking because all the teachers knew and some students did but not many. In the middle of 5th grade history which I assume was doing nothing but play games on the computers , The principals assisstant called me to the principals office where I remember having awkward eye contact with the principal and the vice and having an insincere, awkward apology and walking out of the office in the same awkward silence  I entered it in. I later found out that in the 2 months I wasn't caught in they were interrogating the black kid and trying to get to the bottom of the porn bandit and eventually they got to me.I assume I went wrong by using the only available computers in front of the windows but I sometimes wonder if it wasn't...

I'm 14. I'm a dude. I was with my dad who I always thought was an asshole. We went to see avengers endgame for the second time. Afterwards we saw a homeless lady digging through the trash. My dad asked her if she needed food (I was surprised bc my dad sometimes isnt nice). We took the lady to a weirnershnitzel bc that's what she asked for. On her way she explained why she was homeless. All of her past employers didnt like her which in my opinion wasn't her fault bc she worked for snobby rich people. After that we dropped her off were we met her. And she said that whenever she was in a dark place God would send an angel and it really touched me and opened my eyes. Ty for reading this just thought it needed to be heard.

  1:36pm, read the clock.It has been 6 hours with 36 minutes since he went to work, 6 minutes since he left work. I waited in front of the digital alarm clock, counting down the seconds for the 37th minute.   1:38pm, it passed. Did he leave? Did he forget? Did he find another one and left me here to rot? Will I die? Oh god what did I do? Was it because I didn't take my medication yesterday? Should I k-The apartment door's knob jiggled, following the satisfying unlocking sound of the door. I let go the breath I didn't know I was holding. I looked at the alarm clock; 1:40pm it read.   "Cathe? I'm home" Followed with the memorized jiggle of his keys. I stood up and ran towards him, my lover, my other positive healthy side. I hugged him tightly, feeling him hug me back as tightly in return.Even though I might go crazy tomorrow, next week or next month, I'm not sure. I'm only sure of one thing: he loves me and he won't ever leave me alone.:)*Please leave a comment if you want more or a different theme.

 Tuesday  slowly rolled around. I had spent all of yesterday in bed feeling like I  was hit by a truck and not knowing what to do with myself since Kaitlyn  hadn�t gotten back to me. I felt like my world was ending. It was  around 4pm with there was a knock at my bedroom door. It was Mike �*Hey man I have something to tell you it's big you might want to sit down*�  he said as he came into my room and took a seat on my computer chair.� I  sat down on my bed feeling my heart start to sink a little lower into  my stomach. �*What�s going on*?�  I asked not knowing if I really wanted to hear the answer. He sighed  and looked at me. �About what happened the other night man... it wasn�t  entirely Nicoles fault� �*What are you talking about her and Ashle*� I started to say before he cut me off. �*Dude it was Billy and Ashleys  plan. Ashley wants you and Billy has had eyes for Kaitlyn for a while  now. I guess they figured they could drive a wedge between you guys  while she was out of town and from the looks of you its working*� I stood up fists clenched �*That mother fucker*� hearing the of anger in my own voice �*I�ll beat his ass why is the hell would Billy of all people do this*� I started to walk towards the door when Mike spoke up again �*Already taken care of man*� he was smiling. That�s when I noticed his right hand was wrapped in a bandage. �*What did you do Mike*?� but I already knew the answer he just smiled again �*Come on man we need to go see Nicole take a shower and get dressed... you look like hell*�  I couldn�t help but let out a small laugh but I did what he said and  soon we were both in his truck headed to the mall where we knew Nicole  would be hanging out. On  our way to the mall we decided it would be a good idea for Mike to get  Nicole as I had said some nasty things Sunday night and she was probably  still mad at me. I sat  at a table in the food court waiting, thinking about what I was going  to say to her. I felt bad for what I had said but it had been in the  heat of the moment and I was hurting. I hoped that she would understand  and forgive me. I also know our friendship was something Kaitlyn really  valued. Would mending things with her help me get Kaitlyn back? Would  She go to bat for me and tell her best friend what really happen? Would  she even speak to me after what I said?� I was pulled away from my  thoughts by the sound of Nicoles voice. �*What do you want*?� Her voice was frosty I could tell she was pissed at me. �*Nicole I am so so  sorry for what I said I was hurt and angry. It�s not an excuse I should  have never said those things to you. Can we just talk for a minute and  try and work this out*?�  She thought for a moment then sat down across from me with her arms  crossed. I knew whatever I said I was going to get her sassy attitude  back but I deserved it and I was prepared for almost anything she would  say. I told her what Mike had told me about Ashley and Billys  plan and tried to explain why I said what I said to her told her I was  sorry and that I needed her help talking to Kaitlyn. She looked at me  across the table arms still crossed but her expression had lightened a  little. �*I�m sorry I sent that photo*� She said after a minute �*I thought the worst was happening and I wasn�t going to let my best friend go through that*�  I could feel myself get a little angry I didn�t like the fact Nicole  would think I would betray Kaitlyn but I could understand where it came  from. Nicole had been cheated on by her longtime boyfriend last year and  was still bitter about it. She uncrossed her arms and took her phone  out. �*I�ll see if she will answer my call and I�ll tell her it was all a big misunderstanding*� I breathed a sigh of relief just as Mike walked around the corner. �*Heads up*� He said �*Ashley and Billy are walking in*� The  three of us got up to leave, I didn�t feel like having any sort of  interaction with either of those two heartless assholes. We almost made  it to the doors when I heard Ashleys voice pierce the air. �**You son of a bitch**!� she yelled. I somehow knew it was directed at Mike but I turned around anyway. I was a little shocked to see Billys  face. Mike had gone to town on him. His nose was broken, he had a  massive black eye, and what looked to be a couple broken fingers. �*Jesus Christ*� I muttered under my breath hoping no one heard me but Nicole did. She looked from me to Billys face then to Mikes bandaged hand and made the connection. �*My god Mike*�  she said as Ashley was storming over to us with the look of the devil  in her eyes. I realized the argument that was about in ensue was not one  I wished to have in such a public place like the mall. I grabbed Mike  and Nicole and quickly as I could and pushed them outside into the  parking lot with Ashley close on our heels. As soon as we got outside  Ashley pushed Mike from behind and he nearly feel over a trash can. �*The fuck*?�  started to say as he turned around to face his attacker. Her hand swung  around and connected perfectly with Mikes face and made a sound that  made Nicole and I flinch. �**You asshole! How could you do that to Billy he didn�t do anything to you**!�  she yelled almost belligerent. I saw Mikes fist clench and was about to  grab him when mall security intervened.� He called another officer to  escort Ashley to where she came from and he took us to Mikes truck and  told us not to come back for the rest of the day.� We took Nicole to her  car on the way she told me should would reach out to Kaitlyn and get  her to call me. I thanked her gave her a hug and Mike took me back to my  place. He had things to do so he dropped me off.� I  took a long hot shower and finally breathed some sort of relief. I knew  Mike and Nicole had my back in this situation and I decided to cut ties  with the two back stabbing deviants. Things were finally looking up  after three long days of what seemed like hell. Thinking about it I was  glad mall security was there to break up the fight. Things would have  been a whole lot worse had they decided we were not their problem that  day. The water started getting cold and I realized the heater was empty.  I got out dried off and went to my room. I laid on my bed looking at  pictures of Kaitlyn and I and it brought a smile to my weary face. I was  soon drifting off to sleep hoping to dream of my lovey girlfriend.

I've deleted what I've written multiple times at this point, I'm not sure how to tell this story.&#x200B;17 year old me, was essentially a lovesick puppy, I pined and adored over one person, who we're going to call B. She was amazing and the conversations we had in the dark, lit only by a street light on cold winter nights will always be in my memory (I'm not dramatizing this is what we did). As you may be able to imagine at 17, I really had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I was naive and ignorant and it might be safe to say I thought I was smarter than everyone.&#x200B;One thing I did know, I knew for sure was that I was stunted, I had no idea where I was going, what I wanted to do, or even just how to exist outside of B's life. So, a day came after the birth of my youngest sibling when I decided to do something about my life. I met with B and asked for us to take a break so that we could work on ourselves and grow, what should've been obvious to me however, is how B would react to this. She always was stubborn and hot headed (This is basically my type of women, I always thought I went for shy women... But, nope. I realise now.)&#x200B;I and B had friendship rings that we had bought, after our previous friendship rings that were made of plastic broke. The conversation I mentioned previously did not go down well, she gave me the friendship ring back and walked away, I followed her for a moment and dropped the ring into her bag (To this day, my proudest moment in the art of pickpocketing. Ha.) I took my bus home and then proceeds the next few months of me thinking I've made a mistake, we worked at the same place so... Things got a little rough for me as B... I can only speculate but, she turned my co-workers against me, spouting non-sense I presume, I was rather civil after all, the worst hit came when we got back together though... Oh, what an idiot I was. Our relationship was a secret at this point, it was her terms for getting back together. Her Mother hated me, which is where a lot of my speculation comes from for the belief of her telling lies about me. As before then I and her mother were on good terms.&#x200B;Ultimately, this failed again. I went two months without smoking (Dirty habit, don't do it.) but, as things got rocky again, I started back up and this was the final straw for her I suppose, over the arguing... I accused her of liking someone else or perhaps I might of even said she was cheating on me. (I don't fully remember). The truth about that I learnt years later.&#x200B;The relationship ended, not without her accessing my facebook (I gave her my password.) and causing chaos, as well as the good old daily I hate you text. I'm sure there was plenty I did wrong too and could've done a lot more and been better.   Perhaps, the last thing I ever did for her was deliver flowers to her work and I don't remember speaking to her ever again after that.&#x200B;5 - 6 years later one thing has never changed. I still love B and I always will, despite the turmoil we went through, she is one of my most cherished memories. Every now and then I check in on social media and make sure she's happy because, in terms of B that's all that matters.&#x200B;If you read my story, then this is the point. One thing B said to me that has stuck with me all these years is this "My friend at work said, people will come and go but, your first true love you will never forget and never stop loving." (Not the exact words but, the same meaning.) If you find yourself with this person, please make sure you do everything you can to make sure it means something but, don't hold yourself back from finding out who you are.&#x200B;I've found what I want to do in life, I've found my family, I've found happiness.**\[Sorry if this is the wrong r/ - It is a story however and doesn't appear to be against the rules.\]**

 �Wooooooo,� I said, �Wooooooo�. With every pump of air, I feel fuller than ever-slowly seeping air that I need to live. I was created for a celebration, for a birthday. I looked down while bobbing up and down on the ceiling. I watched as Charley blew out the candles and the knife smoothly cutting through the cake. The magic that the magician did blew my mind and my permanent smile feels to be expanding. After the party, I was taken outside with the soothing heat beating on my rubbery exterior. I was then released going up and up and up. I looked at the beautiful landscape that keeps shrinking as I soar higher and higher. As I kept going up I felt a burning sensation within me the sun that once soothed me was now heating me up making me feel hot. Really hot. I felt like I was going to burst. I couldn�t help it. I felt a hole in me that was expanding. Goodbye.

The Counting of days�. I don�t know when it actually stopped�. Days, weeks, months�..decades.. Birthdays, anniversaries, memories�.All painful and bitter in their own way. No one can tell you personally how long your count will be. What will trigger it� and what will eventually make it stop�When my son died it took a lot of time, a lot of alcohol, a lot of self-hatred and a lot of friends to get me to the point that I could function. But I guess function is a relative term� Those I worked with covered for my lack of sobriety to the detriment of my sanity� Words were just that� words.. They had no coherent meaning to me. No magic elixir that could cure my ills and fix that which was broken in me.. A friend recently described it to me as �not being able to see past the hurt in my heart� My drinking didn�t subside for two plus years and that hurt never dulled. It just manifested itself as either hatred or apathy. At work, in relationships, in all facets of what was my life� my existence. And just like the ones that died remained dead, those of us left to live had to continue to do so no matter how much pain, anger and hurt we felt.�So� I pushed on� Some days better than others but all just a tedious walk through what remained of my life that I hadn�t burnt to the ground or burned the bridges to��As time passed, I came to realize that the hurt would always be there, but, the point came where the pain dulled and the happy memories were able to finally overwhelm that pain.�I�ve come to realize that the pain and hurt is the blessing and the curse for us mere mortals� Our blessing as humans for being able to love someone so deeply and completely�. And the curse of the same�So� for those who have suffered that loss at some point in your lives.. don�t allow anyone to tell you that you need to move on or get over that hurt. That hurt doesn�t represent pain� It represents that love.. And the more deeply you loved the deeper the pain will be. And, even though you may feel that you can�t move forward or that every step forward takes you three steps back��. Realize that every day that you wake up and keep your memory of those departed alive is a positive step�Don�t hide how you feel� when you feel like crying�cry. When you have a great memory� laugh or smile�So what if the world thinks you�re crazy? In a way� you are. Not everyone gets to experience that crazy kind of love for a partner� a parent� a child�� Don�t be afraid to celebrate birthdays or anniversaries if it feels right to you�My son died when he was a little over a month past his 8th birthday on this earth. This year was his 37th birthday. I will go visit him and talk�laugh�and cry probably like I always do. But I won�t forget that he was and is a part of me..�Don�t forget that love and don�t ever feel guilty about embracing that part of you�

Hi everyone, I'm new to Reddit and wanted to share my story with you because due to my position at work I couldn't do it anonymously anywhere else. Here's the story. Two years ago I went to college to study for a course that I really looked forward to. Students there (6-7 of us) were fairly friendly at the beginning. Towards mid semester I kind of got annoyed with them all and left because they were quite hostile and the tutor was a D..k so I got bullied out of that course. It sucked to be excluded from group activities and having lunch alone and constant being picked on by the tutor (still think shes a racist) Anyway, that's sort of a short summary for you.Now for the main topic. There was a woman there she's in her late 30's now and we are from the same country so of course my first instinct was to make friends with her since it's nice to know someone that speaks your language and you have much more to share. Anyways she was a total b***h to me for no reason. I was actually good at what I was doing so perhaps it was envy or hate that me being much younger I am able to by pass her. Fast forward two years and I'm currently an assistant manager for a company I won't mention. And oh can you guess who crawls In looking for a job? Yeaaaaa. HER.  It's ironic how we studied same course and yet I was able to get a job with grades from half semester that I did there and she's still unable to find a job. Has earned herself nice reputation around the town though ;) So here she is standing and telling me with a smug face that she's got an interview. So of course my manager knows the story about her and me and actually was excited and curious about her reaction that I'll be above her and training her. Anyways, I was at the front just listening in and he just asked her basic interview question. Now for the fun part, he goes on to tell about me. Mentioned my name and said that I'm a manager to what she reacted very surprised and said how she doesn't know me at all and that "Yeaaah? A manager??!" As if it's so unbelievable. She's the biggest snake I have ever met in my life. Funny enough checked my Facebook today and she has removed me from her friends list even though she's been in my friends list since we started to study... Coincidence? I think not. She's trying hard to hide that she knows me. Forgot to delete the posts she shared on my wall though... *insert a Kermit frog meme pls* I have never felt so f.....g good in my life. Humiliation she will feel when I b...h her at work will be sweet and that's for all the things she's done! I'm sure she won't last long here. Conclusion.Don't be an a.....e to someone for no reason just because you THINK you are better. Karma ALWAYS comes back to slap you.

So today I was a church and I experienced a somewhat scary experience.So when it was time for communion, all of the staff was lined up for communion and a kid (which I assume is the preist's helper) just falls over and is unconsious. The church staff was swarming around the kid and people (including me) were very confused on what was going on. Few minutes after that the preist tells everyone that the paramedics are on the way and communion will resume regulary. Me and my dad left after communion and outside was a cop car. This is probably the weirdest thing I've ever experienced at church.

I was going to a fancy bar to meet a new date. We had briefly talked beforehand, and he said he had arrived. I walked in the door, and sure enough a man is at the top of the stairs. He didn't really look like the guy, but he looked at me and said "sorry, I'm just admiring how pretty you are. I don't work here, I'm just waiting for my date." The conversation continued as such:Me: "oh! Um--"Guy D: "you must be--"Me: "are you?"Guy D: "lovely to meet you, I'm D"Host to me: "table for S?"S was who i was supposed to be meeting! I awkwardly apologized and left. Not 5 minutes into meeting my ACTUAL date, here comes D--Guy D: "excuse me, i think you dropped this"Sure enough, it was his number.Probably my strangest date experience.

So my crush from last year is going to move. She says she swapping schools. I�m sad the last gift I promised to give her is some Spicy ramen that I promised her if she didn�t spoil the end game ending. I just got done texting her she says she will be moving Monday. I want her to stay but she can�t I probably won�t be able to see her again. I�ve told her I�ll bring the ramen and I�ll see her Monday. Two days from now will be out last day together and I still like her since last year. I�m guessing I�ll have to let this one go. It wouldn�t have worked out I�ve told friends and my friends were hinting that I like her and she said were just friends and all that you know the typical shit. I still don�t care about that she�s still my friend and I don�t know what I�m gonna say to her whether I�ll tell her how I feel or let her go away forever. Knowing me I�m probably destined to be alone not everyone has a chance to be happy. Maybe I just don�t deserve anyone�s love maybe I�m supposed to live a miserable life. Gods probably torturing me for asking to much of him and if so I�m sorry. And if it�s not god then Lucifer has a tight collar on my neck restraining me from ever being happy.

So yesterday a guy had to fix the furnace, I was in my room minding my own business, doing work, and drawing. A few minutes later I hear my dad and this guy coming downstairs, they went in my room and they just talked. I was watching YouTube when they went upstairs, then the guy came downstairs and went in my room to fix some stuff for the furnace, I was watching a YouTube video out loud because I didn�t have headphones in, so he heard what I was watching, super awkward because the video was about text fails and there was a lot of swearing and sexual innuendos, I looked through my bag for my headphones but I couldn�t find it, so I played it without headphones and let it play, he also had to awkwardly ask me a question about the furnace in which I knew nothing about, as well as he probably thought I was 8 because I look like 8 but I�m actually almost 19, terrible times, but oh well I just did not care and played it until he left, next time I am definitely going to be out when someone is fixing stuff near my room.

I usually never post things that much but, I am just going straight with a very peculiar and complicated dream.It starts off, with some fences, blocked like. Almost like Minecraft however, with some civilians cutting down that fence. It's weird because I have never had any relation toward a fence. Next, are children playing amongst the fence and I am at a three quarter view at them. Finally, shades of black, with narrow streaks of lights, creating a large triangle. It is facing downwards. Towards the floor.Never, in ever will anyone could understand this I think. However, it's somehow about society.

Why do people say seeing is believing? I have seen magic, and I still don't believe it.Seriously!My nine closest friends and I had a reservation at a restaurant in San Francisco. We made the silly (potentially stupid) decision to squeeze into a vintage Dodge Ram van and drive into the City because we didn't feel like dealing with BART (the San Francisco Bay Area's version of the subway). After circling for an hour and after one heart stopping trip down a busy one way street in the wrong direction (totally be accident), we finally found a parking spot within a half mile of the restaurant. We parallel parked with a good two feet to spare both in front of us and behind us, and called it good. A few hours later, we returned to our vehicle to discover the cars in front of us and behind us were gone. Different cars had taken their spots, and (if you're familiar with the City, I bet you saw this part coming) there were three inches between them, at most. We were sandwiched in! If you can imagine making the perfect sandwich and then stomping it flat, our vehicle was the stuff in the middle.We had three options for getting out. One, push the vehicle sideways into the street (physically impossible). Two, levitate the vehicle straight up and then lower it into the street (physically impossible, unless you're a bloody wizard). Three, wait until the owner of one of the other cars returned (which could be frickin hours). We were in total despair when a woman walking down the crowded sidewalk noticed our distress. She looked at us, looked at the problem, and approached us with a confident smile that could best be interpreted as, "Dudes, I've got this! Not even a challenge!""I'm a valet driver," she said by way of introduction. "I can get that out for you.""It's impossible," we moaned.  "Packing cars like sardines and getting them out again without damage is what I do," she assured us. "You might say it's my superpower."We whispered amongst ourselves, and were like, "I don't know, man. This feels sketchy. What if this whole thing is a setup to steal our car?"Our "car" was a vintage 80's Dodge Ram van that seats eight people comfortably. We managed to squeeze all ten of  us into it for the trip. Oh, and it looked like it had taken on every car in the world in a death race and survived to tell the tale (with the battle scars/dents to prove it). But that mofo was worth its weight in gold for spare parts, so...  We whispered some more and arrived at a general consensus. Trust her just because the alternative was annoying AF. We tossed her the keys. She caught them one handed. She slipped into the driver's seat and did some sort of magic trick because 15 seconds later the van was in the street and horns were blaring because it was blocking traffic. We all witnessed it and yet none of us believed it. It was impossible, unless she was a witch, or a genie, or a god damn fairy godmother! I had chills. I mean the hair on my arms stood up, my heart raced, and I had chills! Seeing is not always believing, dudes."Just a valet driver," she assured us. We offered her a cool $20 bill for her service."I don't take tips when I'm off the clock," she said, and then she waved goodbye and  vanished into thin air. OK, so we actually lost her in the crowd, but she might as well have frickin apparated. So the next time you're in a situation like that, call on a valet driver. I swear they all graduated from Hogwarts.

Back when I was probably 15 years old or so my two older brothers got into a phase of routinely picking on me. (As all older siblings do). One day my mom sat us down and showed us a documentary about Matthew Sheppard, who was beaten to death because he was gay. Obviously she meant so show us why making fun or picking on people is awful, but the second the documentary finished both my older brothers go "Wait so your telling us \*insert my name\* is gay?"&#x200B;Varsity move by my mom, but JV execution.

So when I was 16 i was diagnosed with an iron deficiency, whatever, it affects me a bit but if i have my pills and eat right its not overly noticeable. But before i had found out what happened. I was scared out of my mind.So one day was at my boyfriends, I was on my period at the time(only bring it up because my body didn't have as much blood as it normally does), we had smoked a little weed to relax and relieve my cramps. Ive never had this reaction from marijuana and I haven't since. The room started to spin and my eyes grew really heavy. I stood up to get a drink and fell to my knees. I passed out for a few seconds and woke up only to throw up on his floor.(he was really good about it and was more worried about me than anything else).My mom picked me up and that night and for the next week i couldn't walk without feeling lightheaded and nauseous, i also passed out twice but I habe no memory of it. Everyone told me it was just the flu I was honestly scared. After bugging my mom for a few days we went to the doctor and I had blood drawn. When the results came back turns out I had very low amounts of iron in my blood, and the amount i bled on my period was enough to put me in danger. So in the end i prescribed birth control to make periods lighter and iron pills, and i never puke on my boyfriends floor again.

I�m new to reddit and thought I�d share this story..So back maybe a year ago sometime between fall and summer, I was with my Dad and his girlfriend at a lake which we had a grounded camper and a small, slow pontoon boat. Both my Dad and his girlfriend are in their early 50�s, and all they do on the lake is relax. I, however, was 15, and I already didn�t like going to the lake, because I was constantly bored and I HATED my Dad�s girlfriend.So on the weekend in particular we went out on the pontoon for some hours and of course I was bored out of my mind. However, I had brought with me a 32oz of lemonade-flavored Powerade, and this lone bottle of liquid energy is what kick-started the bad weekend. Now, my Dad�s girlfriend is an avid smoker, drinker, and also happens to be a nurse-practitioner. (This is important) She despises me and hates me for the fact that I love to play video games and stare at a screen for hours on end. She however doesn�t get that a screen is NOTHING in comparison to a couple smokes and a good portion of alcohol. She also doesn�t like when I drink something with a lot of sugar in it..  ...and my Powerade had JUST enough sugar to cause her to lash out at me about how it is �unhealthy.�  That�s when I decided to point out to her (and by point out, I mean make a scene) about how smoking and drinking several miller lights within an hour also isn�t healthy and is in fact MORE unhealthy than a Powerade.Fast forward to the next day, and right before we are about to set out on another boring boat adventure, the Girlfriend assigns me several tasks to complete; make a sandwich for lunch, take out the trash, get a towel, and change out into swimming trunks, etc. Halfway through completing my tasks, I feel it necessary to use the restroom before going out on the boat. I use the restroom and come out to resume finishing my tasks. Upon resuming, the girlfriend comes up to me and asks if I am done with my tasks yet. I respond with a firm �No.� and go on to list what I have left to do. (Mind you, it had been maybe 3 mins since she assigned me these things, not quite enough to finish them all.) She LOSES IT. She starts calling me �slow� and �pathetic� which really does it for her. Enter my Dad, who has seen me diligently following the rules, completing my tasks, and who has also heard everything she said to me. He absolutely DRAINS his anger into her, saying he�s �had it up to here with the bs about his (my) drink being unhealthy, and you being so rude to him (me) over every little mistake that he (me) makes, and we are going home, end of discussion.�The drive home was absolutely silent. Fast forward later that day, where the girlfriend has packed all of me and my Dad�s belongings into trash bags, demanding that we move out immediately. I was absolutely red with anger as my once organized room was now a wasteland of trash bags and belongings, haphazardly scattered around with seemingly no care at all. We promptly moved out, and I haven�t had to deal with her as much anymore, and I�m quite happy about it. P.s. I hope she gets mouth or lung cancer from the cigarettes.

This gonna sound super weird (I don�t do drugs, and I�m not mentally ill), but yesterday I was coming home from my daily routine of college. There are usually wild squirrels and raccoons that roam throughout my street, but yesterday morning as a I pulled up and got out of my car, I made eye contact with a squirrel that was spinning in circles with two other squirrels. When we made eye contact he/she stopped moving, (I was less than 5 feet away from them) we both stared at each other for 10 seconds before I said �what�s up bro?�(In a bro voice) and gave him a head nod. The squirrel then proceeded to give me a head nod, when I mean head nod; I mean a full on bro-bro head nod, just like the one I have prior. Then 15 seconds later I said �peace I�m going in now�, and when I said that. The first squirrel stood up on its back legs, causing the other two squirrels to stand on their back legs as well and motionlessly stare at me, until I walked inside my home. Now the squirrels  stare at me in the same spot everyday when I come home. I try not to make eye contact, it�s actually low-key scary.

This happened 2 years ago, so this is how i think it went (was in a different classroom). Sorry for grammar mistakes, I live in Germany. (first post btw.)I went to school as usual and we were having a test. A few minutes later after we began, an announcement came that the teachers should lock the doors to the classroom. Nobody knew what was going on until we finished the test. Later it was revealed that a former student who was either crazy or on drugs went on a rampage with a fire extinguisher. He smashed a window and scraped some posters off. The worst thing is that his rampage was near the 5th graders, which where horrified of course. Local police arrested him shortly after. Everybody called him Fireman Sam (named after TV series for kids) after that point, but quickly faded into obscurity.TL;DR: Former student goes on a rampage with a fire extinguisher at school, gets arrestedEdit: Thanks for the 12 Upvotes!

At the age of 7, my father passed away. Since he was always gone, we never really got to spend time together, and when we did it was play games. Whether it was me watching him or us playing together. Whether it was Socom, MX Vs ATV, Sly Cooper, or Tony Hawk Underground. They are some of my prized memories that I hold tightly onto. When he died, i got his Playstation 2, i moved onto other games like Guitar Hero and other popular games of that time. But from that time, i realized the beauty of story telling through video games, the beauty of the little intricate details that made games beautiful. I used them as ways to forget about everything, but in a way remember him. At the age of 10 i got a Xbox 360 for christmas, as well as Arkham Asylum, which is still one of my favorite games to this day. I dont know what it is but that game enveloped my life. But at the age of 14 i thought about taking my life. Out of depression, anxiety, and a mix of stressful things happening in my life at the time. I know this will sound cliche or whatever, but the thought of never being able to play the next games going out, not being able to continue the Arkham series, "talked" me out of it. At the age of 19, im still fascinated with video games. Everything that made me fall in love with video games, has kept me in love with them. Whenever im stressed from work or school ill just pop a video game in and lose myself for hours on end. Because of video games, im alive. Because of my father showing me the beautiful art form that is video games, i am here today.

This buff guy at a bar told me he was in a 24 hour gym late one night lifting. One other guy was there doing the same. There was no staff. So he went to the locker room preparing for a shower and wrapped himself in a towel. That's when he heard the guy lifting start yelling for help. He ran out and lifted the bar off the guy's chest, saving him, but in the process his balls glanced off the guys forehead underneath his towel. Neither acknowledged it.

There once was a scorpion and a frog near a river. The frog was about to go over to the other side when the scorpion said."Yo, frog. You're heading over to the other side of the river. I'm heading over to the other side of the river. Take me with you.""No." Said the frog. "That's crazy. You'll sting me.""What?" The scorpion responded, "That never even occurred to me. Why would I do that?""Cuz you're a scorpion! That's what you do!""Huh? No, no. Dude. I just got off work. I'm trying to cross the river to get back to my family, I'm a family scorpion. Got a wife and three kids, they change your life.""Hm." Said the frog."Look, why would I sting you? That's crazy. I'll just die too!"The frog rubbed his chin. "You've got a point.""Look, I'm just trying to see my son and daughters, man. Here let me show you pictures." The scorpion pulled out his wallet and showed the frog some tasteful pictures of his family with a Christmas theme where little antlers were affixed to their little scorpion heads."Alright, alright." said the frog. "Get on my back."As the frog paddled out to the middle of the river, the scorpion stung him."What the fuck dude?!""Yeah...""You'll die too now!""Yeah, probably."The frog gasped with his last breath. "You knew you would die! You used that as a reason for me to take you across! Why would you kill us both?!""Idk lol." said the scorpion. They both drowned.

Damn spy is going to topple the Maxican empire. We haven't done anything for almost 2 months because we can't figure out who the spy is. We finally decide how to catch this guy.Actually do something. He wouldn't talk to the principle if we weren't doing anything. We all simultaneously face palmed as we realized that we actually have to see the spy to catch them. We knew from the voice that it was a guy so it put us down to four major suspects.Note these are not the real names as I am trying to protect the innocent.Jarard. The only male queen. Jared. A male bishop who has been less and less active with usBob. A male bishop who was always active. (We didn't really suspect him because he was nice to us and didn't seem like he would do it.James. A male bishop who we didn't know too well but he did plenty of work so he got his way up the ranks. We told all our bishops and queens we were working on something big and it would be executed this month.For the rest of the day we did nothing but watch the cameras. Then it came. We were all sleeping at Max's house because we wanted to watch the cameras. It was fucking 9:45. (I know not that late but you have to realize it was a school.) The spy walks in with hoodie and all. He says to the principle that we were planning something big and to expect it this month. "Any more information?""No.""Well, at least we can have leads try to get more information out of them."She handed the spy a piece of paper and then said "Take this it's the stuff I want to know out of them."We had to find that piece of paper. Whoever had it was the spy. We spent the next week looking through people's bags and they all turned out empty. No paper. No laptop. It was Sunday and we were going to have another meeting to flesh out our fake plan. I went to get doughnuts for the meeting on Monday because we love doughnuts. Walking down to the local King Soopers I saw one of our Bishops in the store. I was going to say high but realized he had friends with him and I didn't want to interrupt their conversation.They were talking about the Maxicans. Then the guy says that his grades had been tanking and he was recruited by the principle to spy on them. In turn she would raise his grades. I've never been angrier in my entire life.I didn't yell at him right then and there I waited until the guy had left his friends. He was a smoker so he went behind the King Soopers to smoke. It was there I confronted him."You piece of human trash. I trusted you. Max trusted you. You're a piece of shit. Yeah I fucking get it your grades suck and you just want to get into college and whatever. But you betrayed your friends. You are someone who I've known since 6th grade and you just treat us like we're nothing. We're trying to make the school better."He was incredibly bewildered.I was just going to keep yelling at him but he said something that set me off."So what. I don't care about you or your stupid friends. You guys are just selfish and don't care about the school."I came right up to him. Even though he was about 6 inches taller I still intimidated him. He started to walk away."GET THE FUCK BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!"I was mad. I was beyond mad. I was ready to kill. He turned around and started walking towards me. He got up on his toes so he was even taller than me yet. He said "Listen buddy I don't care if you kick me out of your stupid group I'll still have an A in math."I responded "This isn't about grades, this isn't about popularity we are trying to make the school a better place. A place where we can learn and get a future."He just proceeded to insult me and call me selfish. Then I did something that I didn't know I had in me.Reached up my arms and grabbed the back of his head. I snapped his body onto my knee. He broke his nose. Blood was trailing out of his nose. He was on the ground and I got on top of him. I punched directly in the eye. He had a black eye.I whispered too him. So close he could feel my breath. "If you tell anyone about this, I'm going to get all my friends and we're all going to do this to you. I want you to know you're a real piece of shit man."As I walked away he yelled "Really, you call yourself some hero. Some white knight. Would a white knight really beat up someone they've known half their life for some stupid group."He then mumbled something I couldn't fully make out but from what I heard it sounded like "A real Maxican wouldn't do this."I didn't sleep that night. I couldn't get the sound of his nose crunching on my knee out of my head. I cried for hours. Did he tell anyone? No.Did I tell Max? No.Did he fully heal? No, he still has a scar on his nose.Did he forgive me? Yes.Did I forgive myself. No.I don't think I've ever done something so bad in my life and I swore to never hurt anyone again. But still to this day I think about it. I still cry whenever I think about it. I don't know how I managed to keep myself from breaking down whenever I passed him in the halls.Sorry for the end getting dark. Part 8 should be more light hearted.

2 years ago on the Long Island Railroad, I saw a guy on the train. We made some small talk, but went our separate ways. He seemed shy, but there was something about him. We bonded over someone spilling coffee on himself. It was pretty funny. A couple of weeks later, we saw each other again, and kept smiling at each other. Neither one of us said anything. I thought I'd see him again, but never did. Flash forward 6 months- I saw him on the train platform, but we were going in opposite directions. We both did a double take, and he gave me a small wave. A couple of other times I saw him, or thought I saw him. This morning, we both got off at the same stop, and I hadn't seen him in almost a year. We again did the double take, and smiled. I couldn't believe he remembered me. I almost hope we never get to know each other because seeing each other randomly every few months is kind of mysterious- an unspoken romance. Right now, he could be anyone.

To my darling.I'm going to cut through all the suspense, and all the uncertainty. Yes, this is, in actuality, a suicide note. However, my love, please forgive my insensitivity for what I am about to say, but don't think of this as the end for me, this is simply my chance to live. My first and last opportunity to live.It's been four years since I started remembering everything, every microscopic detail of every day. If I need to I can remember the last the last time we made love, I can bring back every moment of ecstasy and relive it in exact detail. I can remember the feel of every twitch of your body, every bead of sweat that rolled off my brow. I can also remember the look of disbelief the first time I tried to explain this to you. I can remember the subsequent shock when I repeated every word shared between the two of us that week, matching the cadence and inflections of our voices to the best of my ability. However, my actions today aren't motivated by the clear memories, by the exacts or the known. They are motivated by the uncertainties, by the blurry pictures that appear every time I turn my head, the pictures that a healthy mind would throw away. I can see all the blurry pictures, I can remember all the sounds that no one else heard, all the muffled misunderstood voices one hears in a crowd, all the contradictory ways in which the blowing wind touches a person. My darling, in all these memories that everyone seems to have forgotten I see things others don't. I feel things, and I've come to understand how powerless I truly am.I cannot even come to understand my experiences lest I am to throw away the bulk of them. That is all we do, that is all humans are. We are lie machines, we make sense of the world by lying to ourselves, by throwing away the blurry images, because we cannot begin to understand them. They are, by their very nature, incomprehensible. I am going to spend my last days in a dream world, I am going to recollect our first days together, before I experienced everything, before I remember every detail. I am going to spend my last days falling in love with you all over again, in a world devoid of the unknown. I still love you dearly, however I cannot keep my sanity in this world, I must leave it and regress into the past, and then further into the next.

[My daughter made ramen noodles with shiitake mushrooms for us tonight.](http://i.imgur.com/GfNrk.jpg)I always get a craving for this meal on cool, damp, cloudy days like today, thanks to a backpacking trip to Isle Royale National Park in 2001. I spent 11 days on the island, and nearly half my meals were ramen, with dried shiitakes added in for texture. When backpacking, weight is of utmost importance; the heavier your pack, the harder your days will be. Literally, every ounce in my pack and on my person was counted. Every meal and every snack was planned in advance. Ramen is not only lightweight, but it is fast to prepare. This is important too, because that means less stove gas is needed...meaning less weight you have to carry. Dried shiitakes, with a full weeks worth weighing less than an ounce, are a perfect way to add texture to the otherwise bland meal. It was a rough trip. Of the 11 days on the island, it rained 10 of them. The trails were wet, often underwater, and nearly always slippery. It was hard to dry out at the end of the day, and far too much of my time was spent inside my tiny 1-man tent. But I kept on my pre-planned schedule with grim determination...all the while praying for the sun. On day #9 of the trip, I was hiking from the Little Todd Harbor campground to the North Lake Desor site. This hike, only 5.7 miles, is the hardest section of trail on the island. You spend the entire time hiking from one low, wet swamp, up to an exposed rocky ridge, only to go back down to a wet swamp again. When it is raining, the rocky ridges are as slippery as ice. When you fall, you are 40 pounds heavier, thanks to the pack, and you land in a puddle. And then you are even wetter; carrying around even more water weight. There are about 15 of these dips and climbs on that hike. The 5.7 mile hike took me over 8 hours. For reference: on a good trail, I can hike 10 miles in less than 2.5 hours, with a full pack on. That trail, a section of the Minong Ridge Trail, is pretty damn tough, and even worse when it's raining. When I finally made it to camp, I found I was all alone. The temp was in the mid 50's, and it was raining fairly hard. So I dropped my pack, and waited for a break in the weather to set up camp. After about 90 minutes, the rain paused, so I quickly made camp, and began warming up a pot of water for my ramen noodle dinner. North Lake Desor campground sits in a large stand of white birch, right on the lakeshore. It was early spring (late May, but that's early for up there), and the undergrowth was still very small, so the ground was still covered in leaves. Everything was wet, and a bank of fog was coasting lazily down the lake in my direction. While I was sitting there, enjoying the heat from the stove and marvelling at my soggy view, I noticed some movement out of the corner of my eye. I looked around, but all I could see was the white trunks of the birch trees and the leaves on the forest floor. But clearly, something was moving, so I looked closer. After a few seconds, I realized that EVERYTHING was moving. The leaves, the mud, the tree bark...it was all...shifting. So I looked even closer...and then I saw the slugs. Slugs...millions of them...were everywhere...everywhere. They were large, about 1 inch long, slimy, and were dull in color; a darkish brown on top, fading to a light tan at their foot. With the break in the rain, they were coming out of the leaf litter en masse, and climbing the first thing their slimy little bellies encountered. Rocks, tree trunks, my pack, my tent, me. They were climbing up my boots, my socks, my legs. I stood up, shook & peeled them off, and kicked the leaf litter away from my perimeter. This, thankfully, got rid of the nearby slugs. I went back to my seat (a wet log) and turned off the stove. I opened the pot, and stirred in the seasoning pack while relishing the thought of warm food in my belly. And that is when I made a remarkable discovery.[Rehydrated dried shiitake mushrooms that have been broken in to small pieces look amazingly similar to slugs.](http://i.imgur.com/GfNrk.jpg) My dinner was delicious.

Inevitably, a minimum wage job will make you hate something. Fill cones at Dairy Queen for a summer and you�re going to end up with a strong distaste for ice cream. Spend a few months manning the fryalator at McDonalds, and it�ll be years before you can swallow a chicken nugget without gagging. However, in my experience, working at a video rental store does not make you hate movies�the feeling is a bit more abstract and complicated, like the way you �hate� that ex-girlfriend you can�t get over. And it�s not the movies you�ll feel this way toward; it�s the watchers.Allow me to explain:If you�re an average movie watcher, you rent about once a week�maybe twice. You�re not the kind of customer that bothers me. In fact, I probably won�t even remember your name when you come to return that new Keanu Reeves movie you liked so much, or whatever other putrid slops the cultural marketing apparatus has demanded you consume lately.There are certain customers who come in to rent movies every day. They need their daily fix of redundant melodramatic bullshit to fill the gaping holes in their lives. These are people whose existences are so pathetic that I have to suppress the urge to ask them if they would like an extra plastic bag with which to suffocate themselves after they finish their movies. At least that way they can die the way they lived, twitching like insects in front of their glowing electronic campfires.10 is the maximum number of movies you can rent at one time at Blockbuster. A woman once came in and rented 9 children�s movies and �A Beautiful Mind.� A few days later she shot her 7-year-old kid then turned the gun on herself. We found out when the police came in to return her DVDs.People who rent 10 movies at a time are dangerous. They�re ticking time bombs. They�ve reached a limit on the amount of space in their lives that can be filled with movie watching. There�s a reason that 10 movies is the maximum. The average movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long. Multiply that by 10 and you get 23 hours and 20 minutes, leaving just enough time to make some popcorn (on sale tonight, 2 for 1 with each rental) and take a periodic bathroom break.�Alright, I can take the next customer over here,� I said. Next in line was a family. I hate kids. They�re always pulling shit off the shelves and screaming. Working at Blockbuster is like birth control. This mother had five little mistakes, 2 of them in a stroller and 3 following her eagerly to the counter. A normal person would think about what a nice family she had. The only thought that crossed my mind was, �Wow, she must really like sex.�The family had almost reached my counter when a very large woman dressed in what could only be described as a green bed sheet with sleeves and a neck hole shoved the mother out of the way, almost knocked over several children, and announced that she, in fact, was the next customer in line. I wish I could say that it seemed rude at the time, but human behavior is inexplicably demystified when you�re exposed to a certain kind of it for long enough.�I want to return these movies,� she said. Her hair was orange, but grey roots were visible. In one outstretched hand she held her bag of 10 DVDs uncomfortably close to my face. In the other she cradled an enormous convenience store soda cup against her equally large bosom.�Sure thing ma�am, did you like them?� I asked. Customers love it when you act like you care. This one looked like a sucker, and she�d probably put in a good word with my manager the next time she came in.Instead, she gave me a contorted, sour look, as if I had stepped on her foot or been caught sleeping with her much-less-ugly-and-obese daughter.�Yeah, but I think they�re a little too sophisticated for you. I got them for my niece, she�s in college,� she said. On the outside, I appeared calm and collected, but on the inside my blood boiled. People who feel superior because they�re not the one behind the counter deserve to be verbally�if not physically�assaulted, but the manager was watching. Her assumed superiority was drawn from mere association with someone who was in college, and that was too much for me. And even more inexplicably, this greasy-faced pig woman mistook my wordless look of rage for an invitation to continue:�She goes to George Washington University. That�s in Washington, DC�our nation�s capitol!� she said.�I�m aware that Washington, DC, is our nation�s capitol. I have some friends at Georgetown,� I said.  (That was a little bit of a stretch, I have one friend at Georgetown and he�s really more of casual-acquaintance-slash-former-drug-dealer.)  �You don�t go to college, do you?!� she said, abruptly aghast. She looked perturbed by this new information. The signs were obvious: sweat was forming on her brow and she was nervously shuffling in her orthopedic shoes.�Actually I do,� I said. �Where?!� she said. �Harvard,� I said, lying outright, �I just do this for the free rentals�love movies.� I stared at her for a while.She tried to say something, but words didn�t quite come out, and then her cauldron of soda slipped from her red, sweaty hams. It hit the ground with a tremendous splash as she ran out of the store.The mother, still patiently waiting in line with her family, had missed the entire episode. She stood facing away from me, chatting with the bearded suit-wearing man behind her, as her son went down on his hands and knees to lap up the puddle on the floor.

I just have one question how would you define love?



******************************



When my grandpa was young, he, his brother, and his friends would dick around and do stupid shit in New York. The New York sewer pipes back then was made out of a really weak and brittle red clay. So one day, they start putting bread in the pipes so the rats would come. Then they would use M80s, an explosive with 1/3 the power of a stick of dynamite, to blow up the rats. Then, one of them got the smart idea to bundle up 20 M80s and throw it into the pipe. So, they lift up the manhole cover, light it, throw it in, cover the manhole, and dive for cover. A few seconds later, a huge fucking explosion blows off the manhole cover. A bunch of rat parts and sewer shit rains all over the street. A few days later my grandpa receives a letter from his brother. Inside is a newspaper clipping describing how the sewer had to be replaced for two blocks because of a "gas explosion".

Straight to the topic, I love a girl from my class and have lot of feelings towards her .So one fine day I was too disturbed of like wether she has feelings towards me or not and I mentally prepared to approach her to talk about this topic,as she is one of my close friend I was a bit scared that this should not be the reason to break our friendship either.And I was out with my friends and here guys I made a mistake,One called her and didn't propose her in person and Two wait for it ,I called her , her phone didn't reach so I texted her "hey I called you and your phone didn't reach" As soon as she saw the text message she called me and I was in the middle of the traffic , I ran out of the road and stood beside a tree in footpath .  I answered the call and started with hey how are you and I replied I'm fine and I was blank for a while and didn't talk yeah there was that awkward silence and she asked "hey what's the matter" and I didn't even have any words to express my feelings .I started with " like I wanted to tell you something since from the beginning of the college " and again I was quite for a while and came up with" hey I had a huge crush on you" and now she was quite for a while and we both were silent for about 25seconds and I said "hello"She replied " your a good friend of mine " so that's it and I got her point (actually didn't) and said " okay did you had dinner " and ended the conversation...Guys this is Second mistake that I was informal and wanted to know instantly without giving her time to think ..So what do you think ,Should I propose her again at the same date in person with all my feelings towards her ...!

The coastal elite controls the national news, so when the midwest was taken over and turned into a kingdom, it took about three months for the news outlets to notice. &#x200B;"What states were it again?...Kansas, Missouri, AND Nebraska?! ... is that a lot? Oof... We've got forty-something more of them left, right?" the president said. His oval office staff traded concerned glances. &#x200B;The following weeks brought news of the King, who began a campaign of conquest that saw the Midwestern kingdom annex Mississippi and Iowa. All under the eye of an astonished president. &#x200B;"Can he do this?" What is happening?!" the president's advisors shuffled papers as they struggled to tell him that as the president, he has to decide how to handle the King. "This is America! Land of the free-- home of all fifty states and the schmucks that voted for me!" The day presided without a plan in place. &#x200B;The Kingdom launched giant pumpkins via trebuchets against the military forces blockading the former states. Ranch hands sent cattle herds stampeding against the infantry. Water balloons full of sour milk and eggs peppered the remainders. &#x200B;The US army troops refused to shoot at the non-lethal enemy combatants, and instead began defecting after hearing about the kingdoms inclusive medical plans-- they included dental and visual! A couple of brace-face cadets started the journey over, but the rest joined when they heard about the four day work week (modeled after Finland's ambitious plan). &#x200B;The guns the troops took with them were melted down and reforged into community centers. The gun power they extracted from the bullets created the fireworks for the first annual independence festival. It took place on July third- unofficially named "Independence day 2.0."&#x200B;What had started as an initial domestic oversight turned into an international catastrophe as support from foreign nations for the young Kingdom grew. While the title "The King" was used- in truth, shadows were surrounding the figure that guided the growing nation. However, the data emerging from the residents placed it at the top of the happiness index, pipping perennial winner, Denmark, and with it, garnered further support and envy for its actions. &#x200B;Years soon passed without the reveal of the King on the throne. The world had no face to attribute the incredible rise of a near-utopia within the belly of the American beast. &#x200B;Year five finally marked the curtain crashing down- exposing a puppet ruler. A literal puppet sat on the throne- behind a velvet curtain. Journalists discovered a coalition of former film students ran the Kingdom. Their sovereign rise born out of a thesis project taken far too serious. &#x200B;They had intended to parody a split from the United States and unintentionally succeeded when crowd participants didn't see the cameras and assumed it was a legal separation. The coalition used film craft to keep the oppositions, spies, from piercing the veil. They also happily accepted all who defected- especially after escaping severe repercussions from the US armed services. &#x200B; Puppy Spring served as a vital cog in the defection victory. The remaining soldiers not sold on the promise of healthcare and sustainable work weeks were wrought low by the unbearable cuteness of the puppy horde unleashed upon them. Thankfully the success of Puppy Spring meant plan "Kitten Puffs" wasn't employed. Small studies showed that while adorable and soft, kittens get agitated at great heights and scratch those who pull them from their mini air balloons. An innovative aerial tactic, but a classic case of "cute, but not worth it."&#x200B;Exceptions for defection did exist, and celebrities and billionaires took the majority of cases. The Kingdom ordered those who possessed immoral amounts of wealth to renounce their assets. The old rules of cut-throat capitalism did not belong in the new nation. &#x200B;As the Kingdom annexed more states-- it left North Dakota for those who didn't want to join the nation. A rumor circulated through the Kingdom that the Koch brothers fought each other over the last functional oil well in the lone state. &#x200B;The Kingdom had repurposed Colorado into a solar farm, which Elon Musk applauded from afar in his new role as an orchard owner. He praised the achievement while insisting people stopped calling him "Johnny Appleseed."&#x200B;The final victory came with the arrival of the former president of the United States. He admitted that the job he took on held too much stress, and wanted to try out the four day work week. Especially since a three day weekend gave him a chance to finally read "Life of Pi" and expand his whittling collection. &#x200B;The Kingdom made a collective "huh" to feign interest and moved on. Within the decade, the whole of the former union bore allegiance to the Kingdom. While the fledgling nation didn't have the same military might as their predecessor, they did possess personal security and self-worth, and with it came ungodly amounts of cowbell and yoga.  &#x200B;[For stories like this and more!](https://www.hamjackal.com/speculative-fiction)

When I was in the 5th grade, I participated in shave for the brave. The next night, my dad offered to take me to a hockey game, and watch our hometown AHL team. I put on a winter hat to keep warm since I was now bald. Before every game, they sing the national anthem, all the fans are asked to stand up and remove their hats. I stood up, and took off my hat, revealing my bald little head. An elderly woman behind me gasped, saying �oh my god, you poor little thing� and started to pet and rub my head. She thought I had cancer. I didn�t know what to do or say, and my dad didn�t notice, so I just sat there while this poor old woman tried to comfort me for a disease I didn�t have...

When I was 16, I lived with my mom and grandma. My oldest brother (Greg, 23) was spending the week with us. He brought his Playstation and had cheats for grand turismo 2. I had a "job" at my neighbors house putting desktop computers together. My neighbors house was literally a stones throw away, super close. One day I got into an argument with my mom, I don't even remember what about, and I went to my neighbors house for a few hours. When I left his house, I noticed that my step-dads (Jerry) van was in the driveway. I thought "Oh good! My mom is leaving for a couple of days. Right on!". I walked up my driveway and walked between his van and my brothers truck. Jerry was sitting in his van and he said something when I walked by but I didn't understand him. I turned around and said "what?". He replied with "don't turn around and look at me you sorry son of a bitch, I'll shoot you dead where you stand". I said "OK, my fucking bad", and I went inside. My mom was in the kitchen cooking fried cubed steak and mashed potatoes with gravy. My brother was in the living room playing GT2. My grandmother was in her bedroom listening to Pavarotti. When I walk into the house I go straight to the bathroom. As I'm washing my hands I hear Jerry yell, "Where is that little sack of shit, I'm gonna whoop his ass!". I walk out of the bathroom and I see him standing in the kitchen. I said "Why Jerry, why do you want to beat my ass?". All he said was "you know what you did, fuck you" and he started walking towards me. After he grabbed me, I managed to get a few really good hits in to his head before my brother was pulling us apart. My brother was a BIG dude. He was 6 foot 3 and he had to be over 250 lbs. After he pulled us apart he started beating the living shit of Jerry. At this point my mom got involved and pulled them apart. Jerry got up said "Fuck all yall, I'm leaving" and he walked out the door. We were all ok, I got a bloody lip but that was it. Not even a minute later Jerry comes back inside, holding a .38 special, yelling " All yall mother fuckers gonna die today, I got a bullet for each of ya!" I ran to my room to get a phone to call 911. I hear a single shot, my mom and grandma scream, then I hear my brother say "You fucking shot me!" Jerry said "I got one son of a bitch, where's the other one?". All this time (maybe 20-30 seconds) I'm in my room looking for a phone and I couldn't find one. Then Jerry walked into my room and pointed the gun right at my face. I could see down the barrel. He was only 5 or 6 feet away. I thought, "Not like this" and I ducked down and to my right while stepping towards him. I grabbed his hand and the gun with my left hand and was beating his face with my right. He wrapped his left arm around me and stepped forward, causing us both to fall to the floor. I still had a grip on his right hand and the gun. I put my forearm on his throat while slamming his hand on the ground, trying to knock the gun out of it. Out of nowhere, my mom was on the ground with us helping me choke him. She told me to go call 911. I said "I can't find a phone and I'm not leaving you" She screamed "Just fucking run!". I didn't want to, but I ran out of my house back to my neighbors. I was almost on my neighbors porch when I heard another gun shot and I fell down. He had shot me in the back of my left calf. I knew if I didn't get up, he would shoot me again. I got up and limped as fast as I could to my neighbors house. I was screaming for help as I'm pounding on his door. As soon ad he opened the door I booked it inside. He looked horrified and said "what the fuck is going on?" I told him what happened as his wife calls the cops. While she's on the phone we hear 3 more shots. The dispatcher said not to leave the house until police arrive. It didn't take long. After they had Jerry in custody, my neighbor helped me back to my house. As we walk towards my driveway I can see Greg. ALIVE. He was sitting on the tailgate of his truck with EMT's. He was shot twice in the chest and drenched in blood, but he was alive. That was the last time I saw him. An EMT helps me up my driveway and we walk past Jerry. He's on the ground, face down with his hands cuffed to his ankles. HOGTIED! As we walk past him he yelled, "That's the mother fucker that started this shit! I'm the victim! You better lock his ass up too!" I turned around, broke free of the EMT that was holding my arm, and had every intention of kicking him in the throat. Just as I pulled my foot back to kick him, the EMT pulled me down by the back of my shirt. I was only able to get in 2 axe kicks before they pulled me away.On the way to the hospital, I found out that right after I got shot, Greg had made his way outside and managed to get Jerry on the ground, and was beating his ass until he was shot the second time. When I was shot it broke my leg. After 1 minor surgery, a few stitches and a cast, I was able to go home. Greg was in critical condition. He passed away early the next morning from a blood clot.Since death wasn't immediate, and on paper his cause of death was a clot, Jerry was charged with voluntary manslaughter and served 15 years in prison. He got out about two years ago. The odds of me ever seeing him again are almost zero, but if I do.......

It was 10 am. We had PE. Before the beginning of every PE session, my classmates and I have fun at the boys locker room, as usual. We closed the door (the room is isolated, there is no light aside from the one coming from the door)  and turned off the light. We shout, we friendly hit someone on his head (of course, he can't know who hit him ), we wave our smartphones with the light on, and we do a lot of fun things. While we do this, the PE teacher always enters suddenly, and everyone acts innocent for a moment. When he leaves, we burst out laughing, then we leave the locker room so the session could start. That friday, he did not enter the locker room. We wondered why, but we did not give it a lot of importance. All the students sat, and waited for him to speak. It was then he said with a low voice " this is my last session with you". We asked him "WHY?" (he is a teacher everybody likes, and he likes our class). He aswered "it is beyond my control, it does not depend on me". We were all wondering why would he leave our school now ? He has no problems here. Amidst the din, one student shouted "SHUT UP ! LET HIM FINISH WHAT HE HAS TO SAY". The teacher thanked him and continued "you know this is our last session, so please, let it end well. Let's keep a good memory of it. This is our very last session.....in 2019" What a man !  He got us because he acted so well, especially his tone.My english is not perfect. If there are any mistakes, let me know them :)

This is a real story that happened in 8th grade lolEnjoy :DSo it was a Monday in school, Me (M) and Friend (F) were at the bus stop waiting for our bus, then some little fat dude showed up, I was just looking in my bag for something idk what, he pushed me aside.I just thought silently, what's wrong with him, as I said he ran past me to F.F is a little small and thin, I'm just normal.So he spoke in a loud and entitled sound: "Hey! You there! The ugly little cunt!" I came from the side and asked him why he speaks like that, he just ignored me like I was air.He continued saying in the same voice:" You got any money or something, I want your mobile! Give me it or I will make you never laugh again!" That's were I came in, I dragged his shoulder and just said:" who even are you that you think you can say something like that, fuck off and everybody here will forget about it." Then he tried to push me, I just did a step aside and turned his arm around that he couldn't move. He said:" let me go I didn't do anything!" I let him free. He immediately punched me in the face, that was the moment were I couldn't hold back anymore (I have a problem, that if someone pisses me off that much, so I just want to let the rampage go).I got in front of him extremely fast that he stepped back like some scared kid and I just slammed him in the ground.I could calm down pretty fast and called an ambulance because he passed out.After all that nothing bad happened, and I didn't get punished because I just wanted to protect him.This was my first post here and sorry if my English is bad :)

When I was younger I got a layered haircut  and highlights and my friend was jealous. Her mom wouldn�t take her to the salon so she put bleach on her hair, then tied it in a tight ponytail at the top of her head, and cut straight across. The smallest layers were an inch long and her hair was fried.  To this day I can�t stop wondering why she thought that would work... We were 17...



******************************



On November 28th of 2018 I tried to kill myself. I recently just lost my Aunt to cancer and still living in the room I attempted in, is absolutely haunting, especially recently. I figured talking about it might help. During the years 2016 - 2018 I went though alot, I was hurting myself, skipping school, I couldn't get out of bed even if I wasnt sleeping I just couldnt leave my bed, get clean and leave. I went though alot of abusive relationships at this time. People who made me feel absolutely valueless and confirmed I had no worth. It was a constant cycle of negitive things with very minimal breaks, it was stressful, and I had so much anxiety from grade 8 - 12 I was very unstable. So when I met a good friend group near the end of Grade 11 it was an absolute relife, I never felt more accepted and cared for by these people, and even ended up dating one of them, which was an incredibly horrible idea. He was perfect. He spoiled me, gave me value, made me feel loved and like to someone I really fucking mattered. Then he took my virginity and a week later he dumped me, it broke my heart, feeling so loved then being exploited for some kink this guy has for cherry popping. But, come the next school year as all of this took place in july, I still expected my friends to be by my side. For a few months they were and I started seeing someone new, but slowly the only one who still clamed to be my friend suddenly droped me for no damn reason. I was hurt, and currently in a new relationship, that felt nice, bit in the end she hurt me too. So randomly in November, Ironically after doing a satanic ritual and committing myself to satanism, I got a text from that friend. Since it was a year ago I dont have it anymore, but ill condense the main parts, She claimed I made her uncomfortable, making sexual jokes around her, and that she hated my most recent art piece because apparently it was all about her and my so called love for her. It was two naked woman holding hands in a psychedelic setting, and at the time I still identified as male and I was dating that other person, so these accusations were shocking, and I was already in a horrible place, as I wasnt going to school, I was falling behind, I was alone in my life, and felt incredibly depressed. Then she added that she never loved me, never cared about me, and there was absolutely nothing that I could do or say to redeam myself.  I was heart broken I couldn't understand why I was suddenly so horrible, but I belived it, I belived I was as worthless and as  horrible as she felt I was, despite everything she said being absurd, I couldn't connect myself with the fact that it was wrong.So, already thinking about suicide, and now feeling absolutely alone in my life, I made the impulsive choice, that I just couldn't keep going anymore. I was crying daily, I wasn't eating, I wasnt taking care of myself, I couldn't, it was impossible to find value in myself. So I overdosed. I ended up in the hospital, lied myself out of getting admitted, claiming I regret what I did, and in all honesty getting admited would do more harm then good, as I have issues with separation anxiety and I need my dad more often then not. But, being alone in that holding room, really makes you feel fucking insane, As soon as I got to the second hospital where theyd evaluate my well being and decide of i was still a danger id just balled, I couldn't stop crying. They took everything I owned and made me feel like I wasn't even a person, my mom came and had to firmly ask them to give me a blanket and a pillow. They wouldn't even let me shower. It was the most belittling experince of my life, I could barely finish the school year, and had to drop out until February. But I lost all my classes, because I shared them with her, I couldn't breathe around her, I had so much anxiety when I did return to school, I left again because I was dealing with so much emotionally. The school ended up saying if I droped out for the whole year, they wouldn't accept me again, in order to scare me into going back into school, it worked, but I dont remember a day I didnt end up balling. Having it be the anniversary, id like to take time to say how much better I am doing in my life, I have a good friend, and an amazing boyfriend, it took me a long time but im not putting up with bs people anymore, and I am going to school constantly now, im doing much better. Im starting to value myself more, but its really hard, but in getting there, so its a plus, even when it seems impossible it does get better, sometimes it just takes awhile.

I was home alone one night, which was unusual because it was a six person household at the time. It was night time, the house was quiet and I was reading at the kitchen table. It was quiet for over an hour and I was immersed in my book when I heard an otherworldly howl rip through the quiet. It gave me goosebumps, made my hair stand up and sent a shiver up my spine. I didn't know what it was at first because I didn't know a dog was capable of making that sound, and I didn't see her make it because she was under the table. It was LOUD, lasted a solid 5 - 7 seconds and seemed to last longer in my mind. I slowly stood up because of how afraid I was and looked under the table to find our doberman/blacklab/rottweiler mix waking up- she'd been dreaming. My heart was hammering in my chest and I felt myself grow warm. "I need a cold shower," I thought- and I took one. I've never forgotten it, and it's been at least ten years.

I posted this on r/Scams but figured this sub is a good place for this.This just happened maybe 10 minutes ago.I was talking to my buddy on the phone about a project we are working on, and then he says "wait, hold on". So I mute myself and he adds this number to the call. I'm sitting on the call and the robot voice chimes in "You can reduce your interest rates" blah blah blah. So I'm quietly waiting and the call starts.( - Scammer, > Friend, < me)\*thick Indian accent\*  \-Hello, would you like to reduce your monthly interest?\>Uhh, ya that would be awesome.\-Ok Ma'am, which card? (my friend is male)\>I only have one\-Ok, which one then?\>The Master Card\-\*types on keyboard\* Ok, ok, I want to verify your expiration date.\>Go ahead\*Long pause\*\-You tell me your expiration date\>But you said you wanted to verify it. I already know it.\-Ok, I just need your card's expiration date.\*I un-mute myself and scream\*  <11/23!\-Who was that??<Me\-No, where is the lady I was talking too?\>I'm here\-WHO THE FUCK WAS THAT??<I am the lady\-NO! GO FUCK YOURSELF! FUCK OFF!<Hey, wait a minute you can't talk to a customer like that!\-GO FUCK YOUR SELF! FUCK YOURSELF FUCK YOURSELF FUCK YOURSELF<Now hey buddy, I still want that interest rate lowered! I want to speak to your manager!\-FUCK OFF FUCK OFF! \*Hangs up\*\>Bro what was that<I don't know man.\>Wow,I just had to share this. It was probably the best reaction I ever got back. Moral of the story, waste their time so they can't call someone that will fall for it, and having a friend on the line is never a bad idea.

I have been with my SO for almost a decade. Before everything happened we liked to spend time together and do everything together. Codependent, I guess you would call it, but reciprocated both ways. We would have normal fights about normal things and could never stay mad at each other for more than a few hours.  He always portrayed himself as someone who had strong morals and stuck to them. He was always very opinionated on people who act disrespectful, always pointing out other people and asking �aren�t you glad I�m not like that?�. I always would say to myself that I never had to worry about insecurities. My friends envied our relationship because I didn�t have some of the issues they had to face. I completely had my trust invested into him because he was my best friend. I had a lot of respect for him and would never go anywhere or do anything without checking with him first. Around January I slowly began to realize that things were changing. He started sleeping on the couch more often, texting his friends all the time. His attitude turned defensive. He would ignore my feelings and stopped listening to the things I had to say even if it was something trivial about work or something I saw on T.V. Money became more of an issue even though I was working two side jobs and a full time, 10hr a day, office job. He worked as well. He would yell at me saying that it was my fault that we never had any money. Of course I confronted him about how he was acting many different ways. I asked sympathetically, screamed, cried, pleaded, and it always resulted in a fight with the blame always somehow being directed at me. I told him I felt alone and asked him to be here with me and not constantly on his phone. Still it continued.  One day I decided to check into a fraud alert on one of our credit cards which led me to find charges to a different country. Upon further investigation I found messages and videos from a girl who he had been talking to since November and had spent hundreds on dollars on. He had sent her gift baskets, flowers, money and even a cake for her birthday. There were messages about how he couldn�t wait to meet her and telling her that he would never cheat on her even though he was in a way doing so to me. Saying that she made all of the risk worth it. Telling her that being with me made his life a joke. He was Skyping with her at hours at a time while I was at work and had photos of her just sitting there smiling or just doing normal things. There were also videos and photos of her naked and photos that he had sent to her. I found more messages to his friends and coworkers telling them how bad of a person that he thought I was and laughing behind my back that he was talking to this girl and I didn�t even know.  Telling them that he was hiding money so that he could go meet this girl and they were planning on meeting up in the UK.He was looking up ways to get a visa/passport. Sending different hotels to the girl asking if she approved.His friends were supportive of what he was doing/planning. There were plans of him leaving without telling me and moving away. Seeing it written down it seems so obvious, but living through it I was oblivious. I knew things were a little rocky but I was doing my best to fix it because I was being told everything was my fault. I never fathomed the idea that he could be cheating on me. I had foolishly gave him my heart and soul completely, I planned on being with him for the rest of my life. I was more than crushed.I confronted him and he pleaded with me not to leave. Told me that this is one big mistake and  he is glad that I found out because now it can be over and done with. Telling me that he felt horrible and that this situation made him learn and realize how much I actually mean to him. He went on and on for days telling me how sorry he was and how she meant nothing to him. That it was all just a fantasy for him and that he was never going to leave. I told him everything that he was spewing is all cliche things people say, but he assured me that he meant everything.  He confessed that the reason why was because he was stressed about his job, the very job that I encouraged and supported him to leave. Helped him on his resume that led him to get a job he actually liked that had great benefits. He said he was stressed about money, so I went out and grabbed two side jobs to help with finances. He told me he was stressed because I wasn�t fun to be around since I would expect him to do chores around the house and then would yell when they weren�t done when I got home. He said that because he was stressed it in turn made him depressed which led him to finding this girl. To me, it�s all bullshit. How can it be a mistake when he knew what he was doing? How can it be a mistake if it lasted months and would have continued if I hadn�t found out? How is it a mistake to laugh behind someone�s back, say disrespectful things about them, and portray them as a bad person to people who are supposed to be friends to both of you? None of it made sense to me, and still doesn�t. I know I�m not perfect. I have anxiety, I am not as self reliant as I should be, I have flaws just like any normal human. But I know I didn�t/don�t deserve the betrayal that has been given to me.It took me 2 months to decide what my next move would be. I felt like(and still do) that I wasted years trying to build a life with someone. Putting in effort of always being mindful and considerate of someone else�s feelings and thoughts. I feel like everything leading up to present day means nothing. That it was all a lie because he so easily threw it away. After a lot of thinking, crying, breakdowns, and late night screaming at him out of anger,  I eventually chose to tell him that I would try to forgive him but that it was going to take me a very, very long time. He in return told me that he would do everything for the rest of his life to prove that I�m the one he wants to be with and how sorry he is. He agreed to the stipulation that I would get to check his phone and any other devices whenever I wanted until I felt that I could trust him again. He promised me to never hurt me again. I took all of what he said as a grain of salt and I bluntly told him so. Actions speak louder than words and that he would have to prove himself. Weeks following, my heart still ached and my soul still felt shattered. I would sometimes cry just trying to return back to normalcy. Grocery shopping, watching t.v., cooking, etc. It all felt like a lie. I was mourning who I once was and the person who I thought I once knew. Coupled with my anxiety it felt like experiencing the stages of grief in short mini cycles and I was trying to hold it in, but that made it 100 times worse. As adults, I would try to have conversations with him about what I�m going through and to see where he stood in the situation but his reactions to how I was feeling were less than comforting. He would tell me how I ruining the good time that we were trying to have. And it would lead into a roundabout fight about how I felt was important too. Sometimes he would hug me and try to understand but most times he would tell me how I was being an inconvenience. Slowly over time, I found ways to hide how I was feeling. Sometimes it bubbles over and again I would be told �I thought we were getting over this.� and what felt like annoyance instead of compassion.  After spilling what I can�t hold onto anymore, the next day without fail, I get a text from him while I�m at work saying that he is depressed and that he wants to kill himself. Taking it seriously, I again put aside my emotions to be supportive and uplifting. However, the cycle would continue - over and over. I felt like I was being ignored and having all my compassion drained from me. I eventually gave up trying to get him to understand. While trying to process everything emotionally, life continued and we had many trips to the ER. My SO had to have 2 surgeries.He expressed to me how scared he was(these were his first surgeries he has ever had). Both surgeries were a month apart. And again, I felt that I had to put aside any anger, animosity, hurt, and brokenness to take care of him and be supportive through it all. It was one of the hardest things I had to do; To pretend I�m ok and be the doting girlfriend everyone expected me to be. The first surgery he came out of recovery and accused me of not caring about him and of going through his phone while he was in surgery. His father was sitting In the waiting room next to me the entire time. It was the first time someone I was close to was having surgery, I was upset and worried about him being under anesthesia, not worried about what is on his phone. But the way he reacted makes me wonder what I would have found if I had chose to look and a part of me regrets not doing so. Now, he is on disability while I work. I will admit that he does anything that I ask of him. But I am always constantly wondering with whom, what, and where he is.  I haven�t looked at his phone in months because I�m slowly trying to establish trust but I�m always wondering who he is talking to, if that really was a telemarketer call, if he is doing what he is supposed to be doing. I feel as though he doesn�t deserve my trust. I find myself  jokingly telling him that I hate him - but there is truth in it. I don�t know if I want to live like this for the rest of my life. I don�t know if these feelings will pass or if I�m stuck in the anger stage of grief. I have suppressed myself to accommodate him and I�m tired/drained emotionally and physically. I haven�t told anyone about any of this until now. Not even my family. It takes me a long time to trust people and to open up to them. But I can�t hold it in anymore, I have to tell someone - anyone. I�m embarrassed and ashamed that I let every guard down and someone got the best of me. I feel like a failure. I don�t want to see my family�s reactions and the look on their faces if I were to tell them what happened and that I don�t know what to do about it. He and my dad are good friends and I don�t want to ruin their future relationship if I truly choose to stay. I now sometimes hate to be around him. I have little to no respect for him. I have trust issues with him and everyone he calls a friend. I used to be excited when I would think about marriage with him, now I just feel panic in my heart. Will that change? I have no idea. It�s been 11 months since this first started and there are a lot of questions that I have yet to figure out. I feel like I�ve put so much energy, time, and work into this relationship and am conflicted if I should just walk away. I sometimes feel that don�t want to, but I don�t know if it�s because I�m scared of what the change will bring. I am conflicted because I don�t see him as a bad guy, I love him and I want to love him, he has good qualities. He is always willing to help anyone who asks. But I feel like what he did to me was sinister and he continues to stifle the raw emotions I still have. Always asking for me to be supportive of him and not willing to give any support back. I don�t know if I can get past the hurt and anger that keeps hitting me. There is a part of me that thinks this entire situation is stupid and Im not asking for sympathy. I just needed it floating out here to get it off my chest. Maybe bring clarity to myself. If you�ve made it to the end, all I can say is thank you.

This evening, about an hour ago, I was driving back to town from my parents place just outside of town.   The highway is a single lane, and has its twists, turns, and rather steep hills.  The local time is just after 22:53, I know this because of the timestamps of the following 911 call.The weather is unpleasant, it is sleeting lightly and the roads are just wet enough to make me drive carefully, there are no street lights out here, it's dark.As I turn a corner that leads to the steepest section of road I notice that there is a vehicle stopped about three forth's of the way down the hill from me. Not unusual given that there are several driveways in the area.   However, upon closing the distance to the truck, it becomes apparent that something bizarro is afoot. The truck, a red Ford T150, is stopped, and apparently parked, at a canted angle pointed vaguely uphill and opposite the steep side of the hill that is protected by a freshly dented guardrail.   The lights of my car are shining directly into the cab of the F150, and it appears to be empty. I bring my car to a full stop and call 911. I report that there is an empty, but running car blocking the highway about 10 minutes outside town.   The operator of the call asks me the usual questions as I peer around looking for the missing occupant(s) of the ford.   I see no signs of anyone in the area, so I make like a character of a horror movie and get out of my car. I'm still answering questions as I round the truck to grab it's license number when I catch movement out of the corner of my eye. Something in the cab of the truck moved.  My curiosity piqued, and instincts ignored, I peek into the driver side window. There is a middle aged man, lightly tinged with vomit, hunched forward and down strapped into the drivers seat. I panic.   I calmly yell at the 911 operator that there is an unconscious man in the car.  And then nearly shit myself as another car slams its breaks to avoid hitting my own, empty car. I forgot to turn on the emergency blinkers.The driver of the new car, evidently unphased by nearly hitting a car as well as my surely apparent distress, screams some choice profanity in my general direction before continuing on their merry way. The 911 operator snaps me back into focus.   At some point the words "oh shit oh shit oh SHIT, i think i just almost died" leave my lips, I can't seem to remember precisely when.   At any rate, I quickly returned to my fortunately unmurdalated vehicle and figure out how to turn the emergency lights on.I return to the F150, this time I open the door to get a better look at the occupant.  I'm absolutely slammed by the smell of cheap, hard, brown liquor, I feel my nose hairs curl slightly.  The driver is between the ages of 55 and 65, pallid as boiled chicken, lightly marinated in his own vomit, and sweating like a blind lesbian in a fish market.  His eyes are half opened, but unfocused, they wander aimlessly as I lift his head to check his airway and pulse. He is breathing, THANK FUCK.His pulse is another story, it's through the god damned roof, easily in excess of 200 bpm. (Mind you this could be mismeasured due to the effects of the adrenaline on my poor brain).   His eyes are dilated unevenly, and he has a mild abrasion on his right hand. There are no other apparent signs of trauma.  I relay as much information as I can spew at the 911 operator.   Ever the professional, she tells me that there is help on the way and encourages me to not endanger myself.I begin attempting to awaken the driver, I do all the special stuff I've seen in movies my entire life. You know, slapping him around gently, yelling mostly coherent questions at him, and so forth. He replies by slowly spewing vomit, and also shifting his weight off the breaks.The truck jackrabbits forwards with me halfway inside it, it's still in drive with the engine running.   The jerk from the acceleration flings my phone out of my hand and onto the driver leaving me both hands to hang on and swing my body into position and slam the breaks before throwing the truck in park. The engine revs loudly for a few seconds while I catch my breath before I take this doofus' foot off the gas.I pick up my phone, gently wipe some stray bile off of it, and inform the operator that no one, in point of fact, died.  Despite being on the other end of a phone, the operator is visibly relieved.  It's late, I can feel the quality of my writing declining and I have work in around 6 hours. I'll finish up the write up (if there is any interest) tomorrow.

So, there's this game called Jedi Academy. There's a mod for this game called Movie Battles, which expands upon the combat system and allows for you to partake in PvP with other players online. (The graphics are horrible, but the gameplay is really, really good.)   Now, I have a laptop and I do not have a mouse. I do, however, have a controller. So I used a program to map the buttons on my controller to mouse movements/key movements so I could play with the controller. The issue with this was how blocking worked.  So to block in a way that doesn't just end in you dying, you'd have to look or move? in the direction the attack was coming. This was either top left, top right, lower left, lower right. Now, due to playing with a controller though, I couldn't track the enemy very well. So the only way that I could preform this was to have absolutely no deadzone and to very slightly move my stick the moment before I was hit.   Now, I ended up finding a room that had (what I believe to be) a bot inside of it and the bot was really damn good. Like 3 of us could attack it at once and it would just absolutely slay without even using any powers. It would then reply instantaneously from a short list of phrases, either a macro or a bot coded to say things analogous to GG.   I remember I fought in that room, on a bridge, for like two or three hours and I had to stop cause my eyes hurt but I realized something, I was getting better. I was lasting 30 seconds, then a minute, then a minute and a half, but I couldn't beat him. But when I went back, there was somebody playing as Revan (my favorite character) and it was very befitting. For they had slain that bot over and over, only taking 10-30 seconds to do so each time. I tried to fight against this person and lost. I think it was cause they realized I was really bad, comparatively, they left. But I remembered their name.   So instead of fighting the bot that used the same sequencing and stuff to kill me every time, I went into a more populated room that averaged at 5-8 players at a time and we all dueled.  A lot of shenanigans happened.  But other than that, I decided not to use force powers at all and despite this I was absolutely slaying, pulling easily a 3.0 kd during the session and I was just continuing to warm up and get better, circling around enemies and slashing them in the back .  I decided I was ready and I looked for their person's name and I found them in a room that only had one other person in it and I swear fate designed our meeting because it was like, this huge stone Colosseum with a fire burning in the center. It had steppes leading up and ramps with archways at the top/bottom of them.  When I joined the room, they were fighting someone else so I came nearby but didn't draw my lightsaber or attack them. (Because it's disrespectful to interrupt a duel, the rooms are purely for fighting for fun, the game modes that are focused on getting kills are in a separate section, so it's like a code of conduct thing.)   They killed their opponent but their opponent was also really good. But they're irrelevant to our story. For it was the same day that they had humiliated me by easily slaying the bot that had killed me over and over for hours, had slain me without even a second of hesitation or worry that they would lose. But here we stood, me using a medium-style combat and them using a heavy-style combat.  I swear we fought for like twenty minutes, although it was more like three or four. And it was f\*\*\*\*\*\* epic.   Neither of us used force powers, as I found more skilled duelists thought they were cheap and I also found that combat was much more deadly and skillful without them. We dueled for a while alongside the light of the fire and it reached a point that he was circling me, about to get behind me and kill me when I jumped backwards with a force leap.  I landed on top of the broken part of one of those archways, I shit you not. I literally backflipped over him and landed over his head, looking down and him and you bet your ass I followed it up by trying to jump down for the kill. That didn't work and we continued fighting, working our way up the ramp to the top of the steps.   Once we reached the top of the steps, there was a moment of silence between our combat, where we were kind-of giving each other space and waiting for the other one to move. I refused to move and I swear we stood there for like 7-10 seconds just stagnant. Eventually, he went to attack and right as he did, I threw my saber. My saber deflected off his fkin saber, I shit you not, and went flying. So I started backing up as he kept swinging and called my saber back to myself.   I saw it flying through the air and he had just finished doing something analogous to a Sarlacc Sweep, that I recognized as having a long recovery time. So I instead, advanced before my saber ever arrived in my hand, narrowly avoiding the blow that would've killed me and I cut him down. I had won. It was exhilarating and awesome. We actually continued to duel, the three of us, and had a pretty great time.   Our combat was not pussy footing around either, we were like just going at each other. It was constant offense, fighting for momentum and guard meter. A few close calls and some epic moments later, I had a gaming experience more powerful than the movies for me lol.   TL;DR - Despite being at a disadvantage to the other players, that further play has proven to me to be quite a drastic one, I was able to overcome a really strong enemy in one of the most epic gaming moments of all time.  I really suggest this game for everyone/anyone and I suggest playing the Saber Dueling modes, not the battling ones because truly, guns beat sabers lol. (Until you're really good ;)

A month ago, my girlfriend and I got engaged. We moved into a new apartment and began living together. It was the first time either of us had shared an apartment, so it was a new experience for both of us. We were deeply in love. I knew she was the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with and I thought she felt the same about me.Everything went well until two weeks ago, when I noticed that my girlfriend was acting very strangely. She became so attached to me that it felt like she couldn�t stand being away from me for a moment.One evening, she said to me, �Darling, when you�re not at home, I still feel you near me.�I didn�t attach much importance to these words. I thought she was just being affectionate. However, a few days later, she told me something else.�Whenever you�re at work,� she said, �I often hear your voice� As if you are calling my name.�This began to happen more and more as the days went by and I started to get a little worried about her. One day, when I arrived home from work, I found her sitting silently at the kitchen table, staring blankly at the wall with a glazed look in her eyes. I grabbed a chair, sat down beside her and asked her what was the matter.�I think there�s something wrong with me,� she murmured.�Why do you think that?� I asked.�I saw you today,� she said. �You walked from the kitchen into the bedroom and then you stood back to me, staring out the window.��But I was at work all day,� I said.�I know,� she replied with a sigh.That�s when I really began to worry. I suspected that my girlfriend was losing her mind and starting to have hallucinations.Over the next few days, she kept telling me that she saw me in the apartment when I was at work. She could even describe exactly what I was wearing. My girlfriend was also acting more and more strange. She was getting more and more quiet and she was terrified of being left alone. Sometimes, she would just sit there, silently staring at me.Last night, my girlfriend was very tired and decided to go to bed early. I held her hand and sat on the edge of the bed as she was falling asleep.Just before she nodded off, she said, �You�re not here.��Honey, I�m right here,� I replied. �Don�t worry. Everything is fine.��No, you�re not here,� she said. �You�re in the kitchen.�Just then, I heard a dull noise coming from the kitchen. It sounded like a chair scraping across the linoleum. Then, I heard the sound of footsteps walking down the hallway. Fear gripped my heart. I didn�t know what to do.All of a sudden, the handle on the bedroom door began to turn and the door slowly began to open. Maybe it�s just a draft, I thought as my eyes grew wide with fear. But it wasn�t a draft. The door swung open and I saw a man standing there in the doorway.It was me.It�s difficult to describe exactly what I saw. It was me� but at the same time, it wasn�t me. It was as if I was staring at myself in a mirror, but the other me had cold, lifeless eyes.The other me looked at me for a moment, then turned and left, shutting the door behind him. It took me a moment to recover from the shock and then I sprang off the bed and ran after him.The hallway was empty. I checked the kitchen, then the bathroom, but he was nowhere to be found. The other me simply vanished. It was terrifying.And then, as I stood in the hallway, trying to figure out what had just happened, trying to calm myself down and convince myself that it was just a hallucination, I heard a faint voice coming from the kitchen.It wasn�t my voice, it was the voice of my girlfriend.�We are here to stay,� she said. �Forever.�I realized that my girlfriend wasn�t in the kitchen. She was lying in the bedroom, exactly where I had left her just seconds before. I was so frightened, I started trembling like a leaf.I ran into the bedroom, grabbed my girlfriend and dragged her with me, out the front door. We left the apartment that very moment and spent the night in my parents� house.Tomorrow, we will go back to pick up our things. I still can�t understand what happened in that apartment, but neither of us can bear to spend another night there. Hopefully, when we pick up our things, all will be well and no one will be there.

This summer, I was in Romania and I made a Tinder account and I met this girl (lets call her Emma) and she is 20 years old. Now on tinder you have to be 18 in order to use it so I just put that i'm 18 on my tinder, but im actually 16 (I can pass for a 21 year old EASILY). Anyway, the first day I arrive there I matched with her, we talk and she speaks English very well so I dont have to struggle speaking Romanian. The next day I have to go to my 'hometown' which is about 3 hours from where she lives, and thats where I stayed most of the summer. We still keep in touch, convos get more deep, she tells me more about herself and she opens up to me. We made plans to meet up but she was just way to busy and she had work and I couldn't go to her town because I brought a friend with me who doesn't know Romanian and It would be rude if I left him in the town by himself (even doe hes already made friends with my friends) Fast forward to the end of my trip in Romania, my mom said that we are gonna be in \[town name here\] our last day and the next morning were flying back to the states, and that just so happened to be the town where Emma is from and she was visiting there. So I asked her does she want to hang out my last day and she said yeah of course! So I meet her at the airport, she meets my mom and from there my moms friend drives her and I in the city center. I met two of her friends, very nice girls, and we just kinda walked around the town till like 1 in the morning. Then we go to Emma's house and her friends stay there a bit before their Uber arrives, so now its just me and Emma. At this point i'm shitting bricks, I can hear my heart pumping and  I broke a mean sweat in my palms. I was on my phone scrolling on reddit when I hear her say "I'll be ready in 15 minues" and my brain didn't really process that and I was straight up internally freaking out. All she did was change her clothes a little bit, a tad more sexy and we watched netflix in her living room as we ate pizza and I slammed some Coronas down (yes they actually have Mexican beer in Romania)  ffw to 4:30is AM, my mom told me at the airport that I have to be up by 5:30 AM because at 6:45 we have to be at our gate, at this point I asked myself "do I wanna leave this country a virgin" and I obviously said no so I just asked Emma "Hey you wanna Netflix and chill?" and she was caught by surprise and said "Wow that's straight forward, guys try to be a little more subtle about it" and the then the Coronas in me replied with "Baby i'm a cowboy, I want it I get it" (for reference yes I am from Texas)  so she said sure lets see where things go. So shes on the couch next to me and we're spooning and I start taking off her panties and then we go in the bedroom, I slap on my rubbers and did the dirty deed for 45 minutes before my gun ran outta ammunition. After that I got dressed, we talked a bit more and she called me a Uber for the airport. She blew me a kiss, I caught it and I was on my way to the airport. One problem doe, she doesn't know my real age, and I intend on keeping it that way until I meet her again face to face. We still talk, and we made plans to hang out on Hanukkah when I go back, so thats when im gonna have to break the news to her. We're not in a long distance relationship, we are just friends with benefits so if she wants to completely end things, i'm not gonna be devastated, but she is a very sweet and beautiful girl and I do intend on keeping this a long term thing between us because shes super interesting. Thats my story :) if you have any questions just reply to the thread and I'll get back to you with more details.

From the first time I saw him, I knew he was out of my league. Drop dead gorgeous doesn�t mix with below average. I asked him out in October 2017, but he was with someone else at the time. I composed a song for him, and I got pretty depressed when he told me he was seeing someone. But before I left, he asked if I was going to be okay. That meant a lot to me. I continued to go to the Atheist club meetings that he ran, and I met some of his friends. I became a regular there, and occasionally I�d bring brownies. I hadn�t really been a part of a club since high school, but this club made me feel like I belonged somewhere. Over the next 3 months, they were having problems, and I was there to comfort him when they broke up. I never knew her, but I really hoped he was doing okay. From that point, I assumed I�d just get a chance to know him better, and maybe in a year or so I�d get used to being just friends. Around Christmas of 2017, he messaged me on Facebook, asking if I had plans. (I figured he was inviting me to something with a group of friends. He was the president of the Atheist club at our college, and that�s how we met)I tried to get clarification, because it didn�t make much sense that he was actually asking me out until 20-30 minutes into our conversation. I was nervous, but got used to him as the night went on. We had hugged before, so affection wasn�t new, but he kept me close to him as we were walking. We had never seen each other outside of school up until this point, so it was new to me. We rode rides at Knott�s, and my IPhone got water damaged, along with all the contents of my purse. XD At the end of the night, he parked across the street from my house, and we sat there in silence for a while. I could feel that he was going to kiss me, I just felt nervous at the idea of it, so I didn�t make the first move. Our first kiss was beautiful. And through a lot of conflicts, disagreements, mistakes, and distance, we�re still together 1 year and 8 months later.

well, actually story kinda starts beforehand.Non funny bit (unless youre my mate then its hilarious apparently): ok a few years ago when I was 26 I needed to get a colonoscopy done as I was bleeding rear end due to complications of giving birth to my son.I'm pretty friendly, especially when I'm feeling nervous, so I was talking and laughing with the nurses during the 3 hour wait for the operation to go ahead. Now I knew I was only bleeding due to baby-making-related-issues, but there was a 15 min period where I was left alone where I started going down the whole "what if its ass cancer...' line of thought.One of the staff walks in and I was really cold and non-engaging with him because the thought that inhabited my mind during our interactions was my little son at my funeral after butt cancer. He went away and I got a hold of my thoughts and started to talk and chat to the staff again.At some point I realized the guy I had been cold to was the only dark skin member of staff. Weirdly, I became worried that he would see me interacting friendly with the other staff and think I might be racist, so I decided to make a point to say something nice to him or ask him something about himself next time he came by.But they wheeled me into the operation room before I saw him again.So I come out of it, high off my ladyballs, and continue to chat to staff, except this time I'm really making them laugh and I have no idea what I'm saying. Enter in Dark-skin staff guy who I've got into my head that I MUST BE NICE TO OR I'M A HORRIBLE RACIST.So my muddle-balls-high mind came up with all these things to say and the moment they left my mouth I had completely forgotten what I had said to him or if I had fixed the problem or if he was even really real at all, but I was pretty sure I had said something nice none the less.&#x200B;Later on when my partner was with me and I'm still high as a nut, the dark-skinned staff member walked by and I told my partner "Oh no, I think I told that guy he was pretty because I didn't say hello before.'My partner, whose been soothing high little me and all my weird fears for a while at this point, told me not to worry.The dark-skin staff came up to us and said some things (like that I can't drive home and such) and I blurted out "Did I tell you before that you are pretty?''Aha no you didn;t.' he responded'What did I say to you when I was putting on my shoes?''You said you liked my shoes.''Oh good good. I must of just thought you were pretty then.' and I was generally relieved that I had not embarrassed myself.The dark-skinned staff turned to my partner and said "are you together?' my partner responded with a frowny 'yes' and the staff member laughed and continue on his explanations of things I should not do for a while.So fast forward a few days and me and my partner were laughing about all the silly things I had said and done. I was trying to explained to my partner the full scope of why that interaction came about. When I got to the end of the story my partners response was "Well I'm pretty sure he doesn't think your racist.'MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

 Mom came home a few hours after I had made dinner and I quickly told her the good news. She smiled and gave me a big hug. *�I  told you it would work out for the best, you two are to good together  to let something like this come between you� �Thanks mom, I want to do  something special when get backs back Saturday night but I don�t have  any ideas�* She thought about it for a minute �*Flowers are always a good way to go they always worked on me when dad made me mad*�  It certainly wasn�t a bad idea. I hatched a plan to surprise her at the  airport when they came back. Sort of a grand gesture if you will. I  decided to get Nicole in on it as I knew she would picking  them up from the airport since she drove a big SUV. I grabbed my phone  to enlist her help. She finally answered on the third ring. �*Hey whats up*?� �*Hey Nicole I need your help but you have to swear to keep it a secret from everyone and I mean EVERYONE*� I felt the need to really stress the last part. �*Why*� she asked tentatively �*What are you planning?� �Promise you wont tell anyone�* I had to make sure she didn�t say anything as she usually told Kaitlyn everything. �*Fine I promise*� she said sounding kind of annoyed. �*OK  good, I want to surprise Kaitlyn at the airport Saturday when you pick  them up. I need you to let me know when they landed so I can sneak in  behind them please don�t say anything to anyone.*� I could hear her giggle �*Sure thing I think I can do that but I'm taking pictures and you cant say shit about it since I know you hate it*�  She was right I hated taking pictures but in this case it was worth it.  I knew it would make Kaitlyn happy and that�s what really mattered at  this point it time. �*Fine you can do that but if you spoil my surprise I will never forgive you*� I could practically feel her roll her eyes at me over the phone. �*I wont say anything I swear you idiot besides you should I know I wouldn�t ruin a surprise like that*.� That much was true she had helped plan Kaitlyns surprise sweet 16 party and it went perfectly so I knew I could count on Nicole. �*Thanks you�re the best*� She laughed �*Of  course I am that�s why I�m her best friend and besides you need to do  something for her when she gets back or I�m going to kick your ass*.�  I had some more planning to so I got off the phone with Nicole and  started looking at flower prices. �damn there�re expensive� I thought to  myself but hell she's worth it and more I decided on a dozen roses  because why the hell not this was a special occasion and I wanted to  make sure shed remember it. With that done I decided it was time for bed I was exhausted and my girl was coming home in three days.  Thursday  came and went like any other day. Mike came over early so we could  finish working on the mustang. I told him things where back on track  with Kaitlyn and he was happy for me. He had picked up some extra  parts�for me. We got about 75% done with everything we wanted aside from  the paint as that was going to be expensive. Kaitlyn called later in  the day and I filled her in on what Mike and I were doing. She was happy  to hear that I had finally made a decision on what to do about the car.  I told her I was slightly disappointed I couldn�t find any of the  chrome emblems that went on that sides but it wasn�t a huge deal and I  didn�t want to bore her to much with car stuff. She said she was having  fun with her family and she had a bunch of pictures to show me when she  got home. If only she knew what I had planned she might come home  sooner. I just missed her terribly but it was getting late and I needed  to sleep working on that damn car had tired me out. Two more days until I  got to see my beautiful girl again.

OK. so the year was 1643, the nights were long and the days were hot. it was summer of course. back in my home country Krays (not documented as a country because it was too long ago) now known as one of the 5 states in Russia, there was this beautiful lady over the few hundred years I've forgotten her name but we would always go out to the lake and play with a flat disc fly (now known as a Frisbee), I would throw it to her and she would throw it back to me and I would throw it back to her and she would throw it back to me and I would throw it back to her and she would throw it back to me, anyways back to the story. I once threw it to her so hard it went to the "out of bounds area" of Krays also known as Oblasts. a dirty little place that is, always thinking they are better than us with their top spins and their candle. silly people. if they only spent 102 more years in the dark they too would have night vision. Dirty Oblasts I can't wait till we bomb them all with the.. oh sorry let me continue. I threw it over the border to Oblasts and at this time they had a civil war just like the English. I walked onto their territory just to grab my flat disc fly but as soon as I look at it, some dirty scum blew it up. nuclear weapons were being developed at the time even though we had truce agents any explosive they said fuck you. those dirty bastards. so I sat on the lake and waited (while doing more awesome adventures around the word) until 1948. my good old chum Walter Fredrick invented the Plastic Frisbee. at this time the girl at the lake died from the chemicals in the nuclear explosion and I was doomed to live an eternity in sorrow and regret. Fucking dirty Oblasts

Today while waiting with my sister on the car my father was shopping I said to my sister that I gonna view "memes" on reddit (In a joking way) And then she said "What is that?, The best things are in Instagram" (not in an ironical way), Then I show her reddit (app) on my phone and she said again "What is that?".

I have all I need.The razors on the counter would allow me a quick death. So would the rope under my bed.The blades would allow me to do the world a favour. So would the rope.*I can�t take it anymore*... Mother�s new boyfriend was fond of visiting me in the dead of the night. The heavy smog of the city would obscure the windows and the incessant beeps of persistent traffic would smother my cries.*I can�t...*I thought it would get easier with every... incident. But it never did. My insides would remember the feel of *him* days on end and my mouth would have a sticky aftertaste for hours afterwards. *Can I take it?*I thought he would get bored after a year, or at the least, forget me for a night. But he never did.*Can I?*The perpetually moving bruises on my mother�s face only strengthened my hatred of him. The bruises he left on me, however, were less physical and more permanent.*I... can�t.*... And there I stood, rope in one bleeding hand and blade in the other, ready to end my life.To give in to Death. But I can�t.Who would take it in my place?Who would live through it?Who would suffer in my place?I could end his life, couldn�t I?I could strangle him as he slept and cut his body afterwards with the blades for all the pain he inflicted upon my mother and I.But I... can�t.Who would put the occasional smile on my mother�s face?Who would bring a gift while intoxicated to my mother?Who would torture my mother and I in his place?Maybe it�s better to live on.And wait for Death�s embrace.

A couple months ago, I noticed an Instagram account followed me. I didn�t recognize the name and none of the posted pictures had any identifiable information. I had just gotten back on Tinder where my instagram was connected, so I assumed it was someone from there and I didn�t think much of it.Two days ago I saw this account view my story as they always have. They never miss an Instagram story, but yet they never interact with my posts or try to DM me. Intrigued, I go back to their account. They have two new pictures both posted last month, but again, nothing that identified anything. I decided to go look at the follower/following list and noticed that along with a bunch of insta models and fitness chicks, this account followed almost all of my ex�s (let�s call him J) ex girlfriends and ex flings. However, this account didn�t follow his most recent ex, A, but yet she followed the account. Alright, so he used the fake account to follow her and she followed it back not knowing it was him. And then when they broke up he unfollowed her on the fake account for whatever reason. Nevertheless, I was so mad. It was J, using a fake account that he thought I wouldn�t be able to uncover to follow me when I specifically told him to stay out of my life. Or was it?I was furious that J would do something like this. So pathetic and so creepy. I blocked the account and made my account private so he wouldn�t be able to see my account anymore. Also out of anger, I decided to message A. I warned her about the account because it was just plain weird and I didn�t want her to allow the account to follow her only for it to actually be J and her not know it.  She didn�t respond to the message for 24 hours and during that time I was periodically checking to see if she had unfollowed the account and just didn�t respond to my message (which I would be surprised by seeing as I�m basically a stranger and all). She eventually messaged back and said �I had a suspicion that he was following his exes but he denied it. So thank you. I appreciate it.� I messaged her again and she didn�t say anything back so that was the end of that. Or so I thought.I looked at the list of people that she followed again. And even after all of this, she still didn�t unfollow the fake account. As a matter of fact, I looked at the fake account again and all of the old exes were unfollowed, but it now followed her (remember, this account didn�t follow her before I had messaged her about it. This was a new follow since she had gotten the message from me). So it no longer followed any exes except for her. And she still hasn�t unfollowed the account.Remember how I said I blocked the creep account and made my account private? So obviously the fake account can�t see my account anymore and whoever was behind it can�t see my account either unless they follow me. Guess who requested to follow me today. After listening to my warning and continuing to let the account follow her (and following the account herself). A.My guess is that A created the account when her and J started dating. She made it because she either didn�t trust J with his exes and was afraid he was still talking to them, or she was jealous of them. She followed random girls and kept up with the account to make it look like someone was using it regularly. When I found out about the account and warned her, she panicked and worried that the other exes would be able to figure something out so she unfollowed all of them on the fake account. She followed herself on the fake account just in case I was checking up on the account. She wants me to believe that it�s actually J and not her running the fake account. After all, J is using the account to follow his exes, why wouldn�t he follow her as well?This is the story of an amateur creeper. All she had to do was use her main account to unfollow the fake account and I wouldn�t have suspected a thing. I would�ve let her follow me. Instead she tried to cover up her tracks and did it so badly that I was able to figure her out. And the fact that she requested to follow me using her main account, thinking that I�ll accept it because we both have the same terrible ex when in reality she just wants to continue to creep? Pathetic.

When things were due on Friday, did anyone else send the teacher an empty email saying �hey miss heres my assignment� but never attached it so you could pull a �oh miss i forgot to attach!� You would think teachers wouldn�t fall for that shit like twice. I guess they also felt the same way about school. Sorry I needed to post this little flashback of childhood somewhere. Aaah ageing.



******************************



I was in High School when this happened and its kind of not one of my best moments in High School. I think it was bad but I was young and stupid. I was in the 11th grade and I had a crush on a guy who went to the Home Coming. I was shy and could not talk to him. So people told me to write him a letter so I did. I also had a girl tell him I had a crush on him. I later gave up on him but I saw him in the Hall Way to the computer room and he said hi to me. I walked home happy and in a good mood and I checked my Hotmail. I saw his e-mail address and a letter. He wrote that he liked me but he was busy with school and sports and other things and was not looking for a girlfriend. I felt upset. I later went to a party with some friends to feel better but I didn't. I was seventeen and depressed. To make things worse my sister who was in grade school came into my bedroom to tell me she had kissed a boy and she was eleven. I felt that I was a loser and would never kiss a boy. I felt pressure to find love by everyone. I later in life got into unhealthy abusive relationships because the fear of being a lone and that I was less of a person if I were single. I still have this battle. I want a husband and kids. I am in the middle of a divorce with a man that was abusive but I feel like a failure.



******************************



 Let me start by stating that this is not my story, thank god. It was actually one of my coworkers, I swear that the weirdest things seem to happen in his life but he always had one of the best attitudes I�ve ever seen.  A little background: we were US Military stationed in Germany and the restaurant he was going to with his date was in a warehouse that had been repurposed to a bunch of businesses but from the outside still looked like a warehouse with a loading dock all the was across the front. Each business had a metal door that had a small sign stating the name but no other identification or decoration outside. The Chinese restaurant had stairs inside the door since it was on the second floor.Cast: me: the one writing this, F1:the main character  GF: friend date  So on the the tale. I was at my desk that morning when F1 showed up for work and I just stopped in shock when I saw him. He looked like a prize fighter who had lost severely; eyes blackened, lip swollen scapes on face arms and hands. I was shocked and asked what the hell had happened. So he explained it as follows.F1 and GF had headed out last night to the Chinese restaurant at the warehouse. He parked his car and went up the stairs at the end of the loading dock and walked about halfway down the length of the warehouse to where the door to the restaurant was. About halfway to the door, they started hearing the sound of a bass thump rhythm and were thinking that one of the other businesses (a club) was playing really loud techno or something. As they got closer to the restaurant the bass got louder and faster. Just as he reached for the handle to the restaurant door, the door blew outward off the hinges launching him and the door 6 foot across the loading dock and out in the parking lot (about a four foot drop from the loading dock). He woke up to the ambulance.  It seems it was not bass he was hearing it was a cleaning ladies cart that was loaded down with all the leaning supplies. It had gotten loose and was coming thumping down the metal stairs gaining speed as it came. Just as he grabbed the handle, it hit the door and imparted all its energy into launching the door off, frame and all, into him. He only ended up with bruises and scrapes but it certainly ended the date abruptly.  For those of you wondering, no he didn�t sue the place, although they did offer to cover his hospital costs. We were military, so those were covered. I�m sure he got a couple of free meals. Also his GF was not injured, he just flew by her on his way to the parking lot.

A trip in hellAll my life I never feared death. I was ready to go at any given time, with out any questions asked. Now that I'm on my deathbed I have a doubt. My family surrounds me and I see the looks on their faces. They know my breaths are counted, so do I. I don't fear death itself, more what's after it. I blink and my family is gone. I am now standing. I can't see anything, not even my hand that I'm shaking just a few inches away from my face. A fire is lit just a few feet away from me. The ground around the fire is lit up, I can see myself now. My hands look much younger, my veins don't show as much on the back of my hand and my hair covers my eyes, they're long again. I look around trying to see if I can see anything else. The only other visible thing is the floor, a pitch black floor that reflects a deformed image of the fire. I look closer to the fire expecting to see something burning but it's only a flame floating just barely off the ground. I try to walk away from the fire. The distance between us doesn't change. I try walking towards it while looking at the ground. The ground doesn't seem to change, as if I was walking in place. Is this what death is? Nothing but a fire that follows me? To be honest I expected worse after what I had done.I rest on the floor. Trying to figure out where I am. Hell? Heaven, seriously doubt it. Something in between? Much more likely. I've done good and bad after all. The floor isn't that bad it's somewhat soft once you get used to it, well at least soft enough to let me sleep. I wake and its pitch black once more. I can feel something on top of me. I can hear and feel something breathing on me. Something wet touches my cheek and goes down to my neck once it's removed I hear a sound of satisfaction. The weight disappears and a flame ignites at the same distance as the previous one. This one is much bigger, I can feel the heat it generates and the circle of light is much bigger. I distinguish humanoid figures at the edge of the casted light. Some of which are deformed, uneven arms, missing limbs. Other's look just fine, regular human shadows. I get up and start looking around. So many of them�I can hear someone clapping their hands behind me. I turn around and see some 8 feet high monster. I'm a 6 feet man and pretty large. Compared to him I look like a dwarf. It opens its large month in some sort of disgusting smile revealing two rows of sharp white teeth. A tongue, red as blood, comes out of it and licks his thin lips, making them even more red. �ge 35I'm walking through the woods. I'm heading to a small house. No one lives there, I like to go there every now and then to breathe and flee the troubles of modern society. When I first found the house it looked pretty nice. Wanting to keep it for myself a broke a few windows and barricaded others to give it this abandoned look. I was hoping to keep people away from it by doing that but my plan clearly failed. Everytime I went back I found that stuff had moved, beer bottles could be found with faint smell of pot. I took things a step further and barricaded all the windows. I added some demonic symbols in red paint I had found in a book at the library. I was trying my best to make this place unwelcoming as much as I could. All these measures failed once more when last month teens walked in on me reading a book. It was obvious they had started to drink and smoke beforehand. I warned them to never come back and kicked them away when they showed they had no intention to leave. One of them tried to leave but he was way too drunk to run away. I picked him up and warned him once again to never come back and to pass the word to who ever had to bright idea to come again.I was about to walk in when I heard some girls laughing. This pissed me off. I warned them. You'd think they'd understand. I was coming here to drink a few beers and smoke, since my wife hated it when I did that at the house. I went back down the few stairs that lead to the front door, the only door. I reached into my backpack and took a beer and drank it all in just a few sips. It was getting pretty clear that I had to do something about those teens. I went into the woods and found some thick branch. I pulled it right to the door as I couldn't lift it because of the weight and laid it down. Then I ripped a piece of my shirt off and partly stuffed it in a second beer bottle. I took my lighter out of my pocket and set the cloth on fire. I opened the door and called all of them a bunch of fuckers. I threw the beer bottle at one of them. He immediately caught fire and I shut the door. I then pushed the branch between the door and a support beam made out of wood.I could hear them yelling and trying to push the door open, it wouldn't move at all. It took a few minutes before the teens stopped banging on the door calling for help. An hour later the house had completely burnt down. I then walked away with a smile stamped on my face. If I couldn't have that house to myself no one could. I never got caught and this would only be the first of many massacres I'd be responsible of.Rules of hellStep back! I yell fill with fear but the smile on the monster just keeps on growing. His white eyes are looking at me. It then starts laughing. The kind of laugh that could cause everyone in a room to laugh with them. Not for me, I'm paralyzed in fear.-I'm the last thing you should worry about. He answers. Things here don't work like everyone seems to think down on earth. He walks up to me. I won't dare to move. He approaches His mouth right up to my right ear and whispers, An eye for an eye. Then he taps my shoulder and walks up to a group of shadows at the edge of the circle. I believe you were to first ones. He says. Follow me. He walks back to the flame followed by the shadowy figures. Each step they take reveals them a bit more. Once they are up close the flame reveals ten teens with burnt scars covering their faces. The look in their eyes makes it obvious they had been impatiently waiting for me. The flame grows in intensity. I try to step back but i'm still paralyzed. All i can do is move my eyes as im choking and i can start to feel the burning kiss of the flame on my skin. I want to scream in pain but the air gets blocked in my chest. I wake up once more after my skin and my flesh has turned to ashes. I can still feel the burning sensation on my skin but it's not as bad. I look up and see the monster sitting down beside the fire, looking down at me. -What are you? I ask.-I am the judge who decides when people can go to heaven.-After all I have done i can still go to heaven?-Once you have you know what you made these people go through. He then looks around before adding: You'll be here for a while I believe. He then calls someone over under the name of KristianaA woman�s face shows up near a fire. A whore who offered me her services a few months after i burned down the house. I didn't kill her but to make sure she�d stop with her filthy duties I decapitated her right arm. The one in which she is currently holding a carving knife. She slowly walks up to me and lifts the knife above her head.The last judgmentThe burning sensation stayed after my immolation, the feeling of the knife carving into my forearm overlapped the one of burning. Then some person I hit with my car broke both of my legs before vanishing. I can't get up now. I'm partly blind and my skin is peeled off in some places. I look up at the judge, that's what I call him now. -That was the last one? I am more begging than asking at this point.-No. In a last effort I get up on my elbows and look around.-There's no shadow left. I cry. Everyone who I have wronged are gone. Who's left to torture me? I say that last sentence with arrogance. Almost challenging him. At this point I'm in so much pain one more broken bone won't change anything.He just ignores my tone and answers: no one he says. Before I have time to answer back, he goes on and explains to me: When you first came here, I said an eye for an eye. This applies for your good actions just as well. I look around and see a whole bunch a shadows around the circle once more. I break. I start crying and I can't go through this once more. -Look. He saysAll the shadows are now getting closer. All small. Soon their faces are revealed. Most of them are young sick children with a few older ones. One after the other they start thanking me. I look at the judge with confusion.-All these children lived longer thanks to you. Thanks to your donations at the children's hospital. Some of them were still alive at the time of your death. Some lived an extra day, others weeks or even years. It is your turn to feel what they felt when they learnt someone cares for them. Once the last child had thank me, they all got closer and closer. One by one they'd walk through me then disappear. Everytime one touched me, one of my injury would faint. I could finally stand and even breath. Once all the children had disappeared I was left alone once more with the judge. -You are just like me. You are neutral, just as good as you are evil. The judge took a long pause before adding. Your wrongs can't be forgotten neither can your goods. I offer you to represent me on earth. But if you wish you may now go to heaven.Eyes of truthI finally awoke. I know I haven't been gone for long, just like the other's, 10 seconds at most. I look around and I'm surrounded by the other devotees of Josef who have �transcended� like he calls it. I am one of them now. The others non-transcended were moved out of the room before the ritual. I look around trying to find Josef; the cult leader. I look at the devotees standing around me but they won't move or even blink their blood infused eyes. They all wear the same white silk scarf, folded many times on itself, only covering the most important parts. Josef should be here to guide me, like he always had, but he's nowhere to be seen. I'm starting to feel ill as he has always been there when I needed him. I hear him call me but his voice is dimmed. As if he were far away. Two of the transcended move away from each other revealing a room with a half-open door behind them.I head into the room. It's dark and cold inside of it, unlike the really hot and humid weather of the month of June. Josef's voice calls me to go in further. I really don't want to but I know I can trust him and will do as he asks. Once I'm a few feet away from the door it shuts. Not a violent shut as if someone were angry and slammed the door. Just a gentle closing, the kind a mother would after wishing her child goodnight. I turn around and see the judge. I want to run but I feel like a gust a wind would be enough to knock me down.-Don't worry, you can see me under my real form now. It's Josef's voice coming out of that ugly mouth. We should celebrate this! He goes on to say. You are now ascended and can see the world as it truly is. He invites me to walk back out. With him. I really didn't want to get any closer to that but I listened as I had always done. We walked back out and the room was full again with non-ascended. All of them were looking up to us except for the other ascended who were looking at the ground. Only they could see his true form.

Being 16 and in a dance class let's say i have a serious bad case where I embarrassed myself in the worst way. Let's start with a bit of backstory. We're supposed to wear tights whenever we dance. Now we've been told not to wear boxers as they show under the tights and instead we're supposed to wear tighty wighties. Now I have never liked this kind of underwear so I never wore them and I never had any issues. A good tuck and we're in the clear. No that being said I have a rather large penis. Again not a problem, a tuck and we're good, or so I thought. 2 days ago I had a dance competition and I was supposed to be dancing a tango. The first 2 minutes go by fine. We're now in the last 30 seconds and that's when we run into a problem. The girl I was dancing with rubbed by a little to close and that made my body shift into "Go Time" mode. Now when you have nothing but tights protecting you from exposing your manlyness things go sour fast. For 30 seconds I am now poking my partner with my dick (which is not attractive as many would think). This goes on and after the dance I rush to the bathroom. After the whole fiasco I apologized to my partner profusely and we worked things out. Overall not the best day of my life.

My parents kicked me out as soon as I turned 18. On my birthday to be exact, I guess it didn't rant matter that much since I haven't celebrated my birthday in years. I had no where to go, I hit a few homeless shelters but homeless people have major self hating issues. Eventually I just started living in my car. I made friends at some of these shelters, one of which would change my life. Everyone that knows me calls me Red, because of my orange-red hair. This friend, his name was Randy, he was homeless because he was a heroin addict. He put no effort into getting better, and he really didn't care about anyone. One day I get a call from him, he asks me for money. At this point I'd been homeless for at least 10 months, but I had a job and I was working on finding a place. I asked him why and he gave me a bullshit lie, but homeless help homeless out. I brought him the money, he obviously bought his shit and I thought that would be it.Flash forward 3 or so months later, Randy now owes me well over $500. I tell him not to worry too much about it. He calls me again, this time he asks me to drive him somewhere. I agree and I take him to a shifty place. Clearly where he buys heroin.I wait fur him to come back, he takes like 2 hours. At this point I'm pissed. Finally he comes back, clearly fucked up, and he asks me to take him somewhere else. I tell him no. He flips out on me, talking all sorts of shit right to my face.I'm a rather reserved man, and him blowing up at me because I said no was too much. I kicked his ass out of my car and I didn't talk to him for weeks.Finally I run into him one day, he's acting all gangster. I ask him if he has the money he owes me. He tells me to fuck off. So I call the cops, he gets picked up and talked to jail over drug possesion. At this point I'm done, I drove out to his dealers house and I walk in. I tell them that I'm a "friend" of Randy and I explain that he owes me money. The guy tells me he can pay off Randy's debt. I take the money and I go back to normal life.A few months later, I get a call. Randy is out of jail and apparently I owe him money now. I tell him off over the phone and I forget about him. Not 2 days later, I woke up to find my car was surrounded.I had this spot in town where I parked to sleep. It was secluded, dark, and had almost no wind. Well here I am blocked in by cars. I sit up and my window gets shattered.I'm dragged out of my car and beaten. I dragged myself to a buddies house and I patched myself up. I hid away for a few days. That's when I got a phone call. It was Randy, telling me to meet him somewhere to settle my debt. I'm not a stupid man, but I can be a force to mess with. I went where he said, after buying a butterfly knife. He acted like we were the best of friends. He introduced me to a load of his drug dealing "buddies" and he said that I was gonna need to work my debt off.I decided that I'd play his little game and it beat his ass when he was sleeping or something. I got pushed around for weeks. Running drugs, selling drugs, everything they told me to do. Then they gave me a shining hope.They sent me to go buy some guns for them. I was to go by myself and I was to bring them guns from this illegal dealer. I agreed, plotting in my head. They gave me $14,000 to buy a boat load of guns.I drove to this guys place, several hours out of the city. I get there and I knock on his door. He greets me like he's known me for years. We head around back of his house and he's got tons of guns.I played my hand smart. I asked if it would be smart to back up to the gate so we weren't seen loading guns into my car. He said that it was customary anyways. I back my car up and I check out the guns.He let me test fire a few because I "needed to know I was buying quality guns." I asked questions, just done small talk. I learned that he lived here alone and that he didn't get deliveries, he picked them up himself.I laid a few guns on the rickety table that was rain washed and moldy. I asked him to set his phone on the table out of respect. He obliged. That's when I picked up a gun and "inspected" it. It all happened so quickly. I went from fake checking out this hand gun to looking down the sites at the dealer. I shot twice, his body fell to the ground. I walked around the table and put a round between his eyes.I crushed his phone with the but of a rifle. After patting his body down and finding a back up phone, I crushed that one two. I picked the best guns out of the selection and I stowed then away in the hidden compartment that the dealers had build into my trunk. I searched the gun dealers house, finding drugs, guns, and cash. I busted open his safe, a still I learned in high school, and I took his cash. With guns and over $100,000 in cash I drove back to the druggies house. I was supposed to park in the garage and show the guns off to the guys. I didn't, I hid a sawn-off shotgun by my seat. I parked in the drive and I walked into the garage, pistol in my hand. I shot every person I saw. I went back for the shotgun and I cleared the whole house.I took 4 bullets in that gun fight. But I killed them all, except one. I barged into the guys room and I found him laying on the floor. He was high on meth and he couldn't hold his gun straight. I pointed my barrel at his head, "WAIT! Wait!" He shook in his boots.I asked him why I shouldn't kill him too. He mentioned that Randy owed him well over $500k. He said that after the gun fight that I started he be fleeing the city. I asked him why I should care, "You can keep it all, anything you get off of him. I'll even pay you! $200k, I just want to see him dead." His voice cracked and squeaked. I told him that I'd take the money up front and he could find pictures of Randy's dead body sent to him in his prison cell. I shot his leg, robbed the house and fled.Soon the cops were all over that house. I fled the city with my $200,000 and with a mission. Collectively I had over $300,000 in me in cash. A good arsenal of guns and ammo. As well as a bit of drugs that I could trade for info.About a week out from the city I called the prison, asking to talk to the guy. I asked for info, I got all I could. Now was time for the hunt.

So, like the title says, I had/have night terrors. Not all the time, but sometimes. A couple times a year maybe. Don�t know why, and don�t really care to find out. Well, one night, when my daughter was about two years old, my sister spent the night at our house, so my daughter slept in our bed while my sister slept in her room. I�m on the right side of the bed, my daughter in the middle, and my wife on the left. Suddenly, I freak the fuck out, jump up, and began screaming at the top of my lungs right at my wife and daughter. I�m kind of in the �push up� position, and my wife and kid are under me. It�s dead silent, and I just begin screaming at them. So, naturally, they freak out and both start screaming back at me. All three of us, terrified beyond comprehension, just screaming at each other. After a couple of seconds, my wife figures out what�s happening and tries to calm my kid down, but I keep screaming. Now, I totally remember trying to stop yelling, but I couldn�t. I knew I was scaring the shit out of my family, but i didn�t have control of my body yet. I was completely conscious, but my body was stuck in whatever dream I was having and I just couldn�t stop screaming. It was the weirdest thing. So, after about ten seconds of total chaos, I finally was able to get control of myself, and I jumped up off my family and sat at the edge of the bed, just breathing hard and trying to regain my composure. I start to giggle a little bit, which caused my wife to giggle, and then my daughter. �Daddy, uhhh, are you ok�?�Yeah. Sorry bout that. Go back to sleep��Babe, you scared the shit out of us��I know. Sorry�.We all are kind of giggling, lightly, still a little freaked out. But at least the screaming is done. Suddenly, my sister yells from the other room �Hey, you guys alright? Dafuq was that all about� and we all started laughing and went back to bed. The End

So, I would like to let you all know that this takes two years ago on December, after Christmas. During this time I was sent to a Mental Hospital for...well...reasons! Also there's a bit of a build up before we get to the main event so you get my situation properly.Quick cast:HK: Hyper KidHW: Hospital WorkerAF: Attractive FemaleMe: You...No it's me.As I was saying, I was sent to a Mental Hospital for the first time, and lemme tell ya, being sent in with tight handcuffs on my bony wrists wasn't fun. I'm not a idiot, but even I have a imagination so I originally thought the Hospital was going to be like those loony bins you see in movies. But surely enough it wasn't! One my first day there I decided one thing! A tactic! Separate myself from the others and live out my 1 week in peace. I'm a quiet fellow who likes being alone so eh. It was going well for a few hours but this beautiful gal, AF, approached me and started a conversation with me out of nowhere during yoga time. (We had schedules alright? Don't laugh.)Me, being the secret Chatty Kathy, enjoyed it greatly especially since no one as great as her has ever even spoken to me. Oh, so that your informed the other patients consist of a majority of girls which no one in their right mind would get on the bad side of. Luckily, your dearest narrator just so happens to be extremely docile and friendly. We talked awhile, she took my first kiss on the first day under the table, I was questioning my existence, etc. However, this is where the real story begins. All the patients were in the Dayroom (Like a living room in our section) watching TV while I got the most soothing feeling of AF petting my head. Don't judge. But that's the evening HK appears, and not for the first time. He's a little runt at the age of 10 I think. It's not even been 3 minutes and he is ALL OVER THE DAMN PLACE! With no control! His mouth running as fast as his legs! And to our misfortune, he scampered our way and with a big toothy grin he spoke--HK: "Hey! Are you two, like, boyfriend and girlfriend?! Like dating?!"Before I could even say anything in disagreement, AF beat me to it!AF: "Yeah, Now beat it you damn Skitz!"HK just ran off giggling like a idiot, while I was blushing and as confused as a fool, telling everyone about it quicker than a gossiping girl. Of course, everyone already found it kinda cute and had their suspicions. Later on during phone calls, AF grabbed my attention for a few minutes.AF: "Listen, I'm sorry for blurting that I hope it didn't bother you... unless you don't actually mind."And like the fool I said--Me: "N-Not at all! I'm actually quite happy to hear that!"AF smiled and got her phone call over with. She gave me her social media and the next day she got out, not without embarrassing me with another kiss straight on the kisser. Then the nightmare begun. The little bastard shared a room with me and he didn't even fucking sleep. And we have a strict schedule so you have to stay out if your room after 6 am so there was no extra sleep. He tried peeking at me in the bathroom, talking shit about me, and even was being pervy towards the girls which were gonna beat hit to a pulp soon.But one night, while I was relaxing, HK decides to act dead after I shoved him away. I rolled my eyes at this. He then got up, acting like he's sleep walking and grabs my throat then squeezed like my throat contained a inch of ketchup he really wanted to get out. I am Strong by no means but I delivered a mean right jab to HK, causing him to fall back.I was furious and half tempted to attempt a full on assault on HK, but instead I left my room and got the HW, demanding I get a different room after explaining the situation. I slept the rest of the night in the Dayroom. He left the next day and I got peace on my last days there. That concludes this little story. If you want to hear more of Hospital stories then I have a couple more from my second and third time. Oh, for you curious folk, the thing between me and AF clearly didn't work out. I regret allowing her to have my first kiss. Well, she more forced it but that ain't the point!!

So this Tory didn�t actually happen to me, but my sisters friends cousin but chances are they don�t have reddit:(Last year she was dog sitting for this older couple who were family friends and the dog was a huge German Shepard. Unfortunately the dog was very old and the couple were well aware that it could kick the bucket any day now:(When the girl came over one morning she found the dog had passed away overnight and she called the couple. They were in California for the week so they couldn�t just come home. They asked her if she could bring the dog to get cremated. Since she was in the city and didn�t have a car, she had to take the subway. She couldn�t just carry around a huge dead dog so she put it in a suite case. As she was getting on the subway she was having trouble picking it up and a guy went and helped her. He was like �that�s so heavy, what is it?� She couldn�t say it was a dead dog because she didn�t want to seem like a crazy person so she said it was her dads old stereo system. When the subway stopped to let pit all the passengers, the guy who helped her carry the suitcase grabbed it from the girl and ran. I wish I could see his face when he opened the suitcase. Anyway I just felt the need to tell you his this crazy story. If u want I can try to get a follow up on what she told the old couple.

I don't know if this is the place to post, so I am willing to move somewhere else if instructed so. Here it goes.When I was 5 years old (am 25 now) my mother told me a short and bittersweet story which I remember word for word."Once upon a time there was a young man who was so very much in love with his girl that he would do anything for her. He even tried to give her the moon and sun and everything that the eye can see.So he proposed, but she said that she will only accept if the young man would bring her his mother's heart.So without even doubting or flinching, he set to do the deed.With tears in his eyes he took his mother's heart and ran to bring it to the woman he loves.So he ran as fast as he could to the woman he loves, and ran, and ran and tripped and fell.While he was getting up he heard a voice coming from the heart:Are you hurt my sweet little boy? "So every time I was angry, sad or in trouble and felt the"need" to argue with or scream at my parents, I would always remember this story and would always say "I love you with all my heart, thank you for loving me."

I was sitting in the theatre, watching incredibles 2, and i was quietly eating some beans, keeping to my self, like normal, when, halfway through the movie, a black teenager came and sat in the same isle as me, a few seats away. I notice him and my hands go cold. My brow starts to sweat. I cant even focus on the movie. I knew I had to put my beans away. I slowly bent over, trying to place my beans on the floor, out of sight, behind my tote bag that contained 47 more cans of beans. I set the open can on the floor. I started to slowly sit back up in my seat, but then, because i ate so many beans, it happened. During a very quiet scene, I farted so loud, it must have set a record. It was a juicy one, and i felt everyone in the theater look at me. Some chuckled. But the one I was most worried about was the black teenager. I knew I had to get out of there. But, as i frantically stood up, I tripped over the bag of beans. The bag toppled over and the 47 cans if beans rolled onto the floor. I turned and tried to run out of there, but it was too late. He saw. In a deep, booming voice he yelled "THIS NIGGA EATING BEANS!" Everyone started laughing. I fell to the floor, defeated. I started weeping. Never have i ever been so embarrased. Only later, after the movie ended, I was able to walk out of there. I am commiting suicide after i finish writing this. This is a warning. You don't think it can happen to you, but it can. Moral of the story: dont go into a movie theater where a black teenager is present, whilst eating beans.



******************************



About two years ago I had the most messed up experience of my life. After having it sit in the back of my mind for all this time I decided I wanted to share it, since I�ve never heard anything exactly like it before. It still affects me to this day and I wouldn�t wish it upon anybody. It�s a hard experience to put into words, but I�ll do my best to try.It was my freshman year of college. I�m the stereotypical good kid, never really drank or smoked. Like ever. It�s not my thing... but my roommate smokes a lot of weed and I don�t have a problem with that. One day he asks me if I want to try it (weed) and I�m like �yeah sure, why not.� And so I try it and it�s pretty nice. It makes me feel truly stress free for the first time in a long time.Fast forward a few days and I decide to smoke again with him. This time he has a different, stronger strain. We get the room ready with towels blocking the door and stuff (we�re in a dorm... don�t want the fire alarms going off) We start taking hits from the same pipe and on the second hit I overdid it and started coughing a lot. Keep in mind this is the second time I�ve smoked anything in my life, so smoke and heat in my throat doesn�t sit very well. After that second hit I stop and try to get the coughing under control. I take a few swigs of water and the coughing eventually comes to a manageable point, but I feel light headed, and not in a good weed-high way. Sitting down on the bed, I start to feel the weed really kicking in, but there�s still that messed up feeling and I�m still coughing occasionally. As I�m sitting there, the high starts to build and I start to enter a trance-like state, and before long I�m not really aware of what�s going on around me.Then the most fucked up thing I�ve ever experienced happens. Time started to loop. I was looking at my roommate at the time and he just starts to repeat my name, as if to ask if I�m okay. Over and over. This went on for what felt like 30 minutes. The section of time that looped was something like 10-20 seconds. I started to pay attention to every little nuance of the situation and every time the scenario would loop, everything was the same. The way he said it, his expressions. I couldn�t respond. It just went over and over. Imagine feeling trapped in a 10 second section of time not knowing if it was ever going to stop. It felt like hell.At this point consciousness cuts. I�m not longer aware of the external world. I can�t see, feel, or think. This is the part I can�t truly describe with words because before I experienced it, I didn�t know it was possible to *not be able to think.* The only think I felt was fear. Just pure primordial fear not motivated by reason, it was just there, and it was the only thing that existed in that moment for me. An unknown amount of time passes and the hallucination starts to progress. I still can�t process any complex thought but I start to become aware that I have a body. I can see... something, but it�s not the real world. Everything is dark red and it�s like a super simplified outline of what I think was supposed to be my body. Imagine learning to move and sense your arms, hands, etc again. That�s what I felt. It�s was like rediscovering the fact that I had a body and that I could move and sense things.At this point I�ve regained some cognitive ability and I feel trapped within my body because I can barely move. So I try to move my entire body side to side and that seems to help get myself further out of the fucked up state. You know that feeling when your leg goes to sleep and when you move it you feel those sharp tingles? That�s what my entire body did when I finally got it to move. That helped to make me... feel things again. Now I can look around and vision is back but at this stage it�s like an acid trip (according to descriptions. I�ve never done it nor will I). The walls are moving and everything�s purple and blue. I still don�t know where I am or what�s going on, but I recognize my roommate and he gets me to the bathroom and probably gets me some water. This is the point where I realize where I am and that I had some kind of trip, and that I was probably going to be okay. I went to my room and let things that shouldn�t be moving stop moving, and then I just rode out whatever was left of the high, not that I enjoyed it after all that. �������I still think back to it sometimes, and every now and then I have a mini panic attack when I�m alone and something happens too many times in a row. It made me change my outlook on mental health, drugs, the fact that someone can experience things outside of the realm of the normal human experience. I realized there truly are things words can�t describe.FWIW, I�m not against weed. I think I have some weird intolerance. I�ve smoked since and it gives me panic attacks because it feels like it�s starting to happen again. It fucks my perception of time.TL;DR- don�t do drugs kiddos haha

I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

Last night at around 11:30 I looked at my best friends Snapchat story to see a black text with the only words of "I'm never good enough". I tested him asking him what's wrong and the only reply I got was a simple fuck off. This is one of my best friends and I treated him like family. I texted one of my other friends asking what was up with him and soon we figured out he was on the edge of a cliff ready to jump. Neither of us had any idea what to do. We got on a phone call with him and he responded to us with only yes's and no's not telling us where he is So at around 12 at night I got in my car to go searching for my best friend. We finally got some information from him, he ran from his house in no direction for 45ish minutes so going from his house we drove around looking for him. He said he was running to a beach we had previously been to and we met him there as soon as we could. Speaking from experience I talked him down and said he needed to be safe, side note I have struggled back and forth with depression. I saved his like. I drove him home and had one of my friends stay the night with him. Woke up at 6:40 today and now I have no idea what is to come today. If you have any resources or something that could possible help I'd love to hear it. This is one of the most surreal experiences I've ever had.

I lost my fellow redditor, and best friend. She was only 14. I dont think i can handle my life without her. I cry myself to sleep, some days i cant even sleep. I just lay there, missing her.I feel like it was my fault, i didnt do enough about it. She told me and i always tried to talk her out of it. I wont survive this. Even if i do, i will always remember you G.



******************************



  Daddy, i love you. You come each day to my room at night and cover me with my old quilt. You work each day and night to get money for me. You don't have a lot of money but you manage to bring me whatever i want. You ask me why i am always sad, but I never answer, because i know. I know you are not happy as you say and try to look like. I know you are in pain. I know your heart is not good. I know you struggle each day to get me food. I know, I know everything. When you put your big hand on your heart and tell me you are alright, i know you are lying. When you start coughing, i know you are in pain. When you go to work each morning i can see the sadness in your eyes although you smile. When i hug you Daddy, i can feel your heart beats talking to me, telling me they are not alright. Just don't leave me, Okay Daddy. Don't leave. I am too young to lose you. i am only 14.

HERE'S A SAD STORY WITH A HAPPY (KINDA) ENDING: (I spent a lot of time writing this so hopefully someone reads it cuz it does have a happy ending)The lowest point in my life was a period of a couple months. Graduated from college & applied to law schools, but got rejected from all of them. I knew I hadn't put the work in to study for the LSAT (law school admissions test), & right after the test ended I felt the lowest I'd ever felt because I knew I bombed and it felt like my life was over. I wouldn't have the career I wanted because of that stupid test. I'd also been dealing with serious depression & anxiety for a while before that, so bombing the LSAT and getting rejected from every school made it so much worse. I developed disordered eating and body dysmorphia on top of the depression and anxiety, and I couldn't get a job after graduating so I moved back with my parents where I was unemployed for a while. I was in bad shape physically too, I'd lost 15 pounds in a couple months from eating around 800 calories a day, so I was down to just 120 pounds- I'd only weighed 135 before, so I was skinny to start with. I was also anemic & super malnourished and almost passed out a few times from not eating enough. I also tried Rogaine since I'm losing my hair, and it destroyed my skin- it gave me cystic acne (under the skin) so topical creams didn't work to get rid of it. I already had zero esteem & body dysmorphia, so having my skin absolutely wrecked (it didn't clear up for 2 months) was a whole new punishment that made me more miserable than you could possibly imagine. So now I'm balding, severely malnourished and underweight (disordered eating), anemic, depressed (plus anxiety), rejected from every law school, and I'm living at home unemployed. So yeah, I was at absolute rock bottom. But it slowly got better. After 2 months of torture, the cystic acne finally cleared up & my skin looked decent again. I was still super dysmorphic (still am) but I def felt better now that I didn't have to hate my skin as much. Still hate my hair tho, I'd give anything to have it nice & thick again. Slowly, after many weeks, I started making progress on my disordered eating. I stopped avoiding food as much and started eating more. I've gained back 12 pounds over the last year, which was not easy. I'm still skinny, but I'm damn proud of gaining back that weight. I've also started working out more cuz I hate looking frail and fragile. But I was so much healthier now, so I'm super proud of that. I'm def doing much better.I also had to retake the LSAT & apply to law schools all over again cuz I got rejected completely last time. But this part has a happy ending too. I spent the next 6-7 months studying for the LSAT (an insanely hard test) & applying to law schools so that I could finally go to school & become a lawyer like I dreamed of. It was awful- it was months of brutal studying all day every damn day, plus all the work of doing all the law school applications on top of that. Finally, I took the LSAT again after months of working my ass off. I was ready for it- even though I wish I'd done a little better (everyone does), I knew I gave it everything I had. Instead of walking in to take the test and feeling totally unprepared like last time, I felt ready. I was ready, I busted my ass for MONTHS making the LSAT my bitch. I was an LSAT expert, and I was READY. I ended up getting the highest score I'd ever gotten, & was above average for that test. I was finally done with this stupid test after months of work, and my work payed off. I spent the next month and a half making my applications as good as possible, then I was FINALLY done with the entire law school process. A couple months later, and I got my first response from a law school: I WAS ACCEPTED!!!! And they gave me a $30,000 scholarship too! :DI ended up accepting that offer, so now I'm finally in law school & am making my dream come true!. Before all this, I bombed the LSAT and got rejected from every school I applied to, had to move back home cuz I couldn't get a job after college (my parents are amazing and I couldn't have done this without them), and on top of that had been dealing with an awful collection of mental health stuff that included depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, and disordered eating. So yeah my life was truly at its lowest point. But after months of hard fucking work, I worked my ass off on the LSAT and went to counseling for my mental health stuff. Still have some bad days mentally, but am doing so much better now. And in addition to that huge accomplishment, I got into law school with a $30,000 scholarship!!! :D

Oh, man. This was so painfully awkward and cringe-worthy I almost passed the fuck out.*I might be under-exaggerating.*I was in the 8th grade when I �officially� learned about the birds and the bees. AKA, penis going inside vag and magic (or horror) happening. I wonder why they even call it that. I�m pretty sure birds and bees don�t have sex with each other and they never should.*Unless there�s like a market for that.*It happened when I was home alone with my dad. He took this prime opportunity to finally teach me about something I had already learned back in fourth grade. I was re-organizing my socks by color when he called me down to the computer. He then bluntly told me:�I�m going to teach you about sex.� *No, thanks.* �Okay.� � Me.For some reason, my dad used *visuals* to actually show me on what exactly happens during sex.*Probably to torment me.*I can�t really fault him at all by doing this because he showed me in raw detail with no sugarcoating how it actually went down. He showed me an educational YouTube video where this Dude was penetrating this Girl. It even showed the INSIDE of the vagina where the penis was entering. First off, they must�ve used a vagina cam which is�interesting and second off�*Where can I get one?*This Video was 4 HOURS LONG by the way and I was beginning to think that he was planning on showing me the whole thing. *I would rather scoop out my eyeballs and eat them.**Crunchy.*I also wondered how the hell this video was on YouTube. I get that it was educational, but damn. I felt as though my dad was showing me a homemade porno.*My favorite.*After the whole thing was done, he asked me if I had any questions.*I didn�t have any questions.*So, I just went back up to my room and continued to re-organize my socks by color. Which got me thinking to the time that I actually discovered porn back in fourth grade. I was sitting my best friend at the time� Billy (not his actual name) and we were watching BrainPop in class on the Smart Board (big touch-screen thing on the wall). A few minutes into the video, one of our classmates� Wilson (his actual name) turned around and randomly asked us if we had been on this porno website. I forgot the name.*I think it was Club Penguin or something.*We shook our heads, but we were interested and we wanted to know more. So, Billy and I agreed to call each other that night and to go on the website together. I will also note that my grandma was home alone with me that night and she was just around the corner in the kitchen.*Making me a sammich.*When we both got to the website, we were horrified. We had never seen something like that before and we were pretty disgusted. We also called Wilson a fucking creep and agreed to never talk to him ever again.*Because yes.*�Eww! Naked people, what the fuck!!� � Me.My grandma heard me and she wanted to turn the corner to see what I was up to. I quickly told her to fucking shoo and that nothing was wrong at all. She insisted and said that she was coming to see what was happening.*No.**Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.*I managed to close the porn window, which for some reason whenever I�m trying to get rid of something illegal and morally corrupt on my computer� it pretty much always craps out and it�s like the computer itself wants me to go to jail. Luckily enough, my grandma saw nothing and I got off scott-free.*The first of many.*Billy and I promised we would never go to that website again. Until something changed within us and we formed a club.*The Sex Club.*

Alright this is a bit of a doozy, so buckle in. Nqvy, stationed in San Diego. Had a barracks room with three other dudes, two to a room, had your own bed. My two roommates were cool dudes, the one that shared my room however, total douche bag. An egotistical, eccentric asshole who thought he was just the greatest thing since sliced bread. Anyways, when he's not there, his only friend crashes in there all the time, and when I say there I mean on my bed with his dirty ass uniform. Nice enough guy, but no respect for anyone or anyone's stuff. Let's call him Francis and the other guy Blue, my roommate. It was a Sunday and we had that Monday off. It was about 7pm and I'm just chilling watching Spartacus while Francis is on blues bed doing his usual stupid shit. Blue comes in with a mutual friend, a girl whose nice enough that I feel she just either pitied blue to hang out with him or just was really that nice. Let's call her Clara. Clara comes in exclaiming she got a new dress, and wanted to go out with us and do something. To which I reply it's 7 on a Sunday, not much goes on really, what were you expecting? She tells us to get ready for dinner, so we do and meet up at a bdubs for some wings. I get those jamming jalapeno and curry ones which honestly taste like salty hamburger helper but that's just me, and then ask her where to from here. At this point, she admits she's never been to a strip club, as do both blue and Francis. Apparently I was the only one who has on a number of occasions, and said, "Well you're in luck cause there's literally one right down the street two blocks". So of course we go, and we sit in front of the stage. Now this is important, the stage was a long oval shape, honestly kinda like a dick and two balls now that I think about it. Anyways we're just under and to the right of the penis head stage, almost center. To our right is no one,I'm far left of the group. To my left in this order: empty, empty, two dudes, two chicks, one of which really into the dancers but not important, empty three dudes, empty empty and some really creepy guy who was already undressing the already naked strippers with his eyes. We get some ones and I teach them to fold it like a tent and give them come cash when they take off clothes, do a cool trick, or do something directed at you. Now a few girls go and then this black girl comes up, I think her stage name was Shauntay? Anyways, no offense but not really enticed by black women so I didn't pay attention much and that when it happened. Those wings had made it to my bowels and cooked up something fierce. I douches in my chair and let out a really quiet but hot fart lasting a good 8 seconds. I mean it was bad, but I knew it was worse cause I smelled it and gagged a little. Like damn, you know it's bad if you gag on your own brand. So I slouch so far into my chair and can't even look at shauntay cause I'm looking to my left and right to see who the fuck is gonna smell this bad boy and just die whenall the sudden my attention is thrown back to Shauntay. "GOD DAMN WHICH ONE OF YOU IGNORANT MOTHER FUCKERS FARTED? DAMN THAT'S BAD, YOU GUYS ARE SUCH JUVENILE ASSHOLES!" And she walked off stage in the middle of her song. All the while, no one else smelled it, they were all in such awe as to what happened and I can barely contain myself and we left shortly after. To be fair, I did give her 20 bucks as a tip but never mentioned it was me. Hope you enjoyed my night with a stripper!

Alright here's part 3(Backstory about the announcement.)Last year some idiot broke his arm while doing soccer. FUCKING ARM! DURING SOCCER! (I KNOW RIGHT) but anyway, the teachers shut down soccer. We were mad about this because it was the only sport we played, we found other sports stupid. But as student president we get to hang around teachers and listen in. The way the rooms were situated was the student principle room (Which reffered to as the command center and I may refer to it later that way in my stories.) was originally a second teachers lounge, so there was just a door seperating us and the teacher's lounge. One of our guys, well it was actually the only girl in our friend group, sits right next to the door. The day we were in there discussing our announcement she told us all to shut the fuck up and listen.We went over to the door and listened. The teachers were talking about bringing back soccer. One teacher said, "We have the money, but my concern is people talking about Chad." (The kid who broke his arm.) Another teacher added on. "Yeah, if we don't clear up Chad the kids will be on to us." They continued talking but we were too confused to bother celebrating that soccer was coming back.Our 9th grade math teacher was probably the most chilled and laid back teacher ever. He gave me a B+ in the class even though I didn't do half the homework. He was also really honest with us and super cool. Unlike most teachers, he actually liked us and we quickly became his favorite. Later that day we asked him about what happened to Chad. He said, be broke his arm while skateboarding, why?" Everything clicked into place. "We have the money to do it." "skateboarding". The fucking principle lied to us about a kid breaking his arm to shut down soccer because they couldn't afford to keep buying uniforms and shit. (Yeah my school was cheap as fuck.)Back to the announcement part!We make our announcement. But Max doesn't make the announcement. Nor does anyone in the Max elite guard. We got some guy from drama who was incredible at acting and could do a plethora of voices. He was using a voice that no one had ever heard before, so we could say what we wanted and they couldn't pin it on a student."Hello everyone. We have a special announcement to make about our good friend Chad. Now everyone but the 9th graders knows about this guy. He was a good person, and a hardworking student who broke his arm playing soccer. Unfortunately for us the school had to shut down soccer."A teacher opened the door.Collectively shit our pants.The kid then says hurriedly "and we're going to dedicate this day to remembering Chad and call it Chad day haha!" The teacher was convinced but overhearing later conversations the students were not. They knew that we didn't give a shit about Chad day and wanted to hear all of what we had to say. That day at lunch some kids talked to us about it. We told them the truth and why we had to lie. The kids spread the truth. Kids asked teachers about it. Our plan was working.The next day the principle got on the intercom and came clean.She was losing her grip on the school already. That's what we wanted.Part four should be up later today. Or tomorrow. Or maybe never. Whenever I feel like it. But this one was long so I hope it makes up for part two.

Here's a hodge podge of stories about my short stint in the ghetto, I tried submitting to /r/funny but the only comments I got were TL;DR.  I can't blame them, no one wants to focus too hard when they come back from a long days work, but hopefully some of you will enjoy it.An Adventure in the GhettoImagine yourself as an upper middle class kid who grew up in predominately white suburbs.  Hah, just kidding if you�re reading this you probably don't have to use your imagination.  But the for the sake of storytelling take yourself to that place real quick.  Think of home and your pristine lawns, moderately sized houses, and that one pot hole in the neighborhood house wives can't seem to stop cackling about.  All of a sudden you're all grown up and off to college with a shitty acoustic guitar, stockpiles of authentic Asian freeze dried ramen noodles, and nowhere to live.  You're looking to settle down somewhere that fits into your small budget and come across the perfect little place.  You find your new home a few to many blocks away from the hustle and bustle of your local campus and now you're in the ghetto.   The first dayYou give your mom a hug, your dad a firm adult handshake, smile, and wave at your parents in your brand new apartment door.  You watch them laugh as they drive away almost as much as that one time you tried to run away as a kid.  You quickly organize all your wordily possessions totaling a whopping $300.  You fantasize about traipsing over to your new hip urban neighbors and introducing yourself, maybe you'll impress them with some witty banter and knowledge of slick lingo and sweet dance moves.  You quickly decide against this and watch porn that makes you question your humanity instead.  After a quick bout with depression and shame you text some friends to come over and check out the new digs in a sad attempt to try and liven up the place.  A handful of soon to be acquaintances nervously walk in and ask why everyone was standing on their porches and staring at them.  Everyone drinks, talks, and promptly leaves before it gets too dark.  You watch more porn and try not to think about how none of your friends will visit you again.  CrackheadsSoon after arriving you see your first crackhead.  He tries to say something to you through roughly five and half teeth, but the only thing you can make out is nonsense and try to relate it to rap music you heard in the club.  The smell of body odor overwhelms you and the stench of feces is only compromised by the smell of desperation.  You're filled with fear and your body tenses up.  Your eyes grow wide and you be begin to tremble with excitement like a sorority girl at a margarita and roofies party.  But then it clicks, the man you're afraid of makes starving Ethiopians look well-nourished and has the body definition of a Japanese school girl riddled with polio.  Then you realize he's asking you for five dallahs to buy a sandwich.  You laugh, get in your car and enjoy your ten dollar vanilla bean mocha latte.  Later you tell your friends how a minority tried to rob you, but you managed to subdue and intimidate him with sweet karate moves you learned in that self-defense class you failed last semester.  Everyone laughs and someone offers you a bump of coke.  CopsYou're walking home and see a few young police officers; older police officers are unheard of in this area because they've wised up and got the fuck out.  You hope they don't notice you had a few strawberry daiquiris earlier in the day, smile and say hello.  You've struck up a conversation with them and they're pleased to see a student is willing to brave the neighborhood.  Hope glimmers in their eyes as they reminisce about how nice this place used to be.  Your conversation is rudely interrupted by the sounds of gun fire off in the distance, and they brutishly rush off and wish you a good day.  You mutter fuck the police under your breath and saunter off like the rebel you are.  You imagine how badly you would mess up anybody that tries to pull a gun on you as you cower under your comforter and nestle on top of 800 thread count bed sheets.  You showed them.New Year�s/ July 4th You can't distinguish between the sounds of gun shots and fireworks.  You stay in your house and re-watch every episode of game of thrones.  PaydayIt's Friday night and you need to study for the big test on Monday. You stagger over to the local gas station to pick up an energy drink to perk you up between hits of Adderall, and pictures of cats doing silly things.  The place looks like a disheveled tailgating party.  Cars are staggered and jauntily parked much like the flat brimmed hats on everyone�s head.  A week of hard labor is exchanged for menthol�s, Mexican sodas, and 40's.  The local denizens speak of that concert they can't wait to go to and discuss how one day they're gunna run this bitch.  Fo� real, they gunna run this bitch one day.  Everyone for the most part stops speaking as you approach and eyes follow you like hungry wolves waiting to pounce on some white meat.  You avoid eye contact and try to look nonchalant.  You've never been so happy to talk to the Muslims that run the store and reconsider your foreign policies on the Middle East.  The sounds of the wildIt's twelve in the afternoon and you're finally getting to sleep after a weekend of house parties, gorging on McDonald�s and blue balls (or for the ladies desert snatch).  Suddenly you're awoken by the sounds of the wild.  The rambunctiously loud sounds of their mating calls are clearly audible through your window.  The female yells �get the fuck out you lazy bitch,� and the male responds with the threat of a stiff backhand as he walks away.  The female chases after, threatens his manhood, and retorts by screeching �You punk bitch won't do shit.�  You stare at the ceiling and can almost see them.  The female is wearing a low cut shirt and has the body of a bean bag chair which spills over her gawdy colored shorts to cover up the word juicy.  The male is wearing a grey wife beater signifying everything he wishes he could do to his mate without the threat of prison.  A car door slams and you hear the ruuuh ruuh ruuh of a car struggling to turn over.  The car kicks with all the conviction of a mule with his balls in a vice and starts.  BRRR BRRR BRRR thunders and shakes your room as a large base rattles a shoddily crafted 1980's American made car.  For some reason you can only think about how the car probably needs new spark plugs.  This happens every week for the rest of your time in the ghetto.  Children teach you a lessonYou see a child and father walking through the neighborhood.  The child is happily running around in circles and laughing with the joy only youth can bring.  The father kindly asks his child to �calm the fuck down.�  However, the rambunctious little scamp continuous to run around his dad like a midget on speed.  Loving father�s eyes carefully follow his child as he raises his right hand to the heaven and takes a deep Shaolin like stance.  His face is that of pure zen.  An open palm cuts through the air as he steps into his new life lesson. The child runs face first into his hand, a poor choice in battle strategy.  The once gleeful little tyke hits the ground; luckily his fall is deftly stopped with the back of his head.  A crack reverberates through the air.  Not only did the kid gain some knowledge on not fucking around, but you and any other on lookers learned a lesson on keeping your fucking mouth shut.  You go back inside, sit down, and quietly behave yourself.  White guysYou see two young white guys traipsing through the neighborhood, your heart starts to flitter and flop as you're overwhelmed with joy.  You feel a happiness only rivaled by a Japanese business man on a train full of �let�s just go with it� minded school girls.  However, you soon realize they're undercover cops, and you're still the only white meat on the menu.  Everyone goes inside and peers out through the blinds like old western town folk at high noon.  Haunted So you've finally decided to carpet bomb your apartment with raid and Agent Orange to get rid of the ever present roach problem.  Your lungs are on fire because you neglected to read the direction much like the 3000 dollars of text books you bought this semester, and because fuck the establishment.  You open all your doors and windows and let Chernobyl part 2 air out for a bit.  You start thinking about your future and all the �this will stop 'em from leaving me babies� your alcohol ridden body will bear.  It�s about this point you realize an alarming amount of screaming goes on at night.   The kind of screaming that makes you almost want to stop watching Adventure Time, shut the doors, and peacefully continue on with life.  But you manage to convince yourself it�s probably just ghosts (spooks if you will) scaring women at a few of the abandoned nail saloons nearby, and only one thing can stop large burly ghosts.  You promptly call the ghost busters at 911 and afterward order a pizza.  The ghost busters never arrive and you struggle to convince yourself a trendy low carb vegan pizza is totally worth the $30 bucks you paid.more in comments

(Hey /r/Stories, this is my first story that I've ever written. Some feedback would be nice. It's a little long, but I hope you all enjoy it.)Today was a normal day. Rainy, cloudy, and dark, mud anywhere a foot would be placed down. Wolfram trudged through it, as he did every day after returning from his high school. Finally after 15 minutes of dragging his feet through the thick mucky puddles, he reached his house.  He entered quietly, and stood at the entrance for a few moments, listening to find out if anybody was home.  Silence echoed throughout the house.Wolfram proceeded inside after confirming that he was the first to arrive. The home was grey, and gloomy, as was everything in his town was. He kicked off his boots coated with mud, threw his jacket on the coat hanger and ran upstairs, straight into his room. He locked himself inside, threw himself on the bed. As he stared at the ceiling above him, he reached across his bed for his iPod. He put in one earphone. His music begun, blaring loudly through the earphone. He wondered where the rest of his family could be. His father would most likely be out drinking, or at his job. A low-paying job that would barely provide for his family each paycheck he got. His mother could probably be found trying to get money from relatives, shopping for the cheapest food around, or at the bingo hall.  After an hour and a half of listening to his music, he sat up straight, and sat down on his desk. He pulled out a pencil and an eraser, getting his utensils ready for when he decides to do his homework. He went downstairs and walked into the kitchen, prepared himself a sandwich and a cup of juice, and went back upstairs. He sat down and reached for his backpack for his homework. Wolfram kept grabbing at the air, until he looked towards the corner where his backpack was. No backpack. Of course, just like every other day, Wolfram forgot his homework at his school. All he wanted to do now was turn off his lights, close his blinds and sleep, but he knew he had to go back, before he knew it, he was once again trudging through the mud.Now, the mud was beginning to mix with the freshly fallen snow. The mixture slowed Wolfram�s pace. After an hour of walking, he finally arrived. He reached for the door handle. He pulled on it, but it didn�t budge. He tried harder, guessing it was just frozen, but still no luck. Obviously the door was locked, and Wolfram caught on. He banged on the door furiously. This walk that was an hour long was pointless, and he was going to have to repeat it just to get home. He knew if he called his dad for a ride him, he would just say what he says every day. �I can�t, I�m busy. Unless you want to provide this family with money, I�ll gladly come pick you up.� Wolfram wish he could, just to prove his father he wasn�t worthless as he thought he was.After a small pep talk to himself, Wolfram turned around and started walking back. He noticed a group of boys sitting around the route he uses to walk home. The quickest route. He hesitated, thinking of he should just keep walking and hope they don�t bother him, or take the long route. He chose after a few seconds of thought. He continued to walk down the route. As he got closer to the boys, he dug his hands into his pocket, and stared at the ground. He walked slowly and casually past the group of boys. This is it, the moment of truth. Will the boys decide to leave him alone? It was the longest ten seconds Wolfram ever experienced. He continued walking, unstopped. He let out a sigh of relief. Right after that sigh, a hand was placed down on his shoulder. �Damn it�� Wolfram thought, as he knew what to expect next.�Well, look at ole� Runt here, thinking he could just ignore us.� The group laughed a bit. A blonde tall, muscular boy arose out the group. �Alright, Runt, just give us what you got and we�ll leave you alone. Wolfram stayed quiet and stared at the ground, almost if he were thinking if he should give them his belongings. He broke free from the grip on his shoulder and kept walking. The boys laughed again. Wolfram was then slammed into the ground and rolled onto his back. The boys huddled around him, two holding him down, and one sitting on top of him, punching him repeatedly in his face.  The rest of the boys were kicking and punching his sides. Some were kicking him in his head. After 10 minutes of being beaten. They got up and took the money from his wallet, and walked away. Wolfram stared at the sky. His face badly swollen, his head throbbing, and some of his bones even fractured.He tried not to cry, as he was told by his Uncle, that a man should never cry, because it washes away the suffering and pain, and that suffering and pain can be the greatest weapon a man can have. So instead, he reached into his jacket and pulled out his iPod, dug one earphone into his ear and lied back. An ambulance siren blaring loudly as it raced down the road Wolfram lied on. Wolfram sighed. �Of course, as soon as my face heals from the last time, it gets swollen up right away��

Today, as part of highschool English homework, I had to read the short stories "Two Friends" by Guy de Maupassant and "Damon and Pythias" retold by William F. Russell.  For most of my homework I leave the radio on one of various rock and roll stations quietly, but to read the stories I turned the radio off to help me concentrate.  This will be lot more significant if you know these two stories, but they both have themes centered on strong friendship.  Anyways, after I finished the stories, I turned on the radio again and flipped through a few stations until I got to 91.3 Jack FM right on time to hear the last 20 seconds of the song "You're My Best Friend" by Queen.It thought it was interesting.

I can remember the exact EXACT moment I realized that people are fucked and that I was going to have a relatively weird time on this planet. I remember playing in this playground, swinging on the swings, hanging from the jungle gym, etc., basically normal stuff. This title old lady sits down on a bench and bends over, putting her hands between her knees (you know that pose) and leans WAAAY down and calls out to me. So I go over."So, how old are you, young man?" she asks me, condescendingly."I'm three years old," I replied. "I live across the street over there."The lady seemed really unimpressed or even disappointed with my answer. What'd I do wrong, I wondered? Then another little kid joins us (probably sensing candy--in those days, the chances of an elderly old lady at the playground having candy was pretty high). The little old lady turns to the new kid and, with the same pose, asks the same condescending question. "So, how old are you, young man?"The little kid throws three of his pink little sapling fingers into the air, and, as cute as can be, shouts, "I'm FREE!"The little old lady throws back, laughing. BINGO, and I could see that she got exactly what she wanted. "Why, aren't you just ADORABLE!" she exclaims to the new kid. She reached into her purse and, from some wax paper, handed the precocious little tyke a homemade cookie.The little old lady's elderly husband joins us. He walked with a cane, so he had just arrived. "This little boy knows how old he is," the little old lady explained, pointing to the cute new kid. "It earned him a cookie, too!""Is that so?" her husband replied. "Well, let's see if this other young man knows how old he is!" And, quick as a wink, without knowing that I'd already been asked, the old man turned to me and said, "And how old are YOU, little boy?"This was the moment. This was when it all happened. I stole a look at the little old lady, then, turning to the old man, I scrunched three of my fingers high into the air and said, as much like a baby as I possibly could, "I'm FREE YERS OLD!""Well, mum!" the old man exclaimed, turning to his old wife. "I think this little fella deserves a cookie, too!"And with that, I turned again to the little old lady and, taking a small but extremely deliberate step forward, I HELD OUT MY HAND. Our eyes remained locked as I watched her reach slowly into her purse for the wax paper."Why, goodness me!" the little old lady exclaimed. "All's I've got is crumbs now. But here you go, little precious. Make do with that."And she handed me a broken, crumbly third of a peanut butter cookie.  I clearly and distinctly remember seeing just a hint of a sneer on her face, as she knew that she'd been had by a three year-old. I remember exactly how I felt. So this is how it's going to be, I thought."And what does a polite little boy say, young man?" her husband asked.I looked up at the little old lady. "Thank you very much for the cookie," I said.And that's when I was three.

When I was a kid my mom took me to the barber shop, my father was coming later with my older brother. When I was getting my haircut my father pulled across the street because the parking lot was full and my brother (maybe 10 or 11 at the time) got out the car and ran across the street without looking. I remember hearing my father yell as the car hit my brother, launching him into the air, knocking him unconscious, and breaking both of his legs. I remember my mom running to the front window and saying " Someones child just got hit by a car" When she realized it was my brother she screamed " my baby!!" and ran outside to help him. Thankfully there was a fire station two blocks down the road. my father picked up my brother, ran him to the station, and they had him at the hospital within 10 minutes. He made a full recovery but just thinking about the way my mother screamed still haunts me to this day

The Whirling Winds whipped across the Ocean of Desolation, relentlessly buffeting the coastal village Gladiolus, seeming endless and timeless in their attacks. Not long ago the few remaining souls of the small village either fled or were flung to their deaths by the Whirling Winds. Now, she sits in her small wind-battered dwelling with little to no hope. Alone she struggles to survive. Alone. The Whirling Winds, alone. Her spirit not broken�at least not yet�she persists, clinging to her few remaining joys. Alone, unbroken, yet devoid of hope, in the Whirling Winds. The coming of the Whirling Winds was the harshest day she could remember. Claiming the life of her mother, Daisy, a beautiful creature, so tender to the cruel Whirling Winds. She recollects that day with a shiver. A frightened baby crying in her father�s arms as he grasps her for dear life in one hand while clutching tightly to the porch railing with the other. Daisy was swept up, up, up into the dark and misty sky until she was nothing but a speck, forever wilted and withered by the cruel breeze. Then she was gone, gone forever, lost to the ferocious winds. The girl left her small dwelling in the village. The Whirling Winds are unusually peaceful. Looking around her, she sees the grouping of rotting and withering houses. In some places, only the stone foundation remains; the rest, long ago blown away. The dead, wind-blasted grass calmly whispering around her. The clouds above changing to a dark shade of gray. An improvement from the usual blackness of her world. As she trudges along the familiar dirt path she remembers Alder.The next of her family to be swept away from her by the Whirling Winds was her father. She was older by then. Strong enough to help in the fields, but not old enough to appreciate the few days of sun with Alder. One fearful day, as she tended to the fields with her father, the Whirling Winds made their attack. They blew, with such a terrifying force, it nearly lifted the harvester off the ground. She grabbed on to the shuddering harvester as Alder reached out grabbing on to her arm. The winds blew harder. With every gust Alder�s grip tightened on her arm, digging his nails deeper into her skin. With every gust, he slid down her arm leaving deep gouges scarring her; forever reminding her of the day she lost Alder. Uprooted from the ground, he too fell at the hand of the Whirling winds. She continues up the dirt path to the cliff overlooking the gray Ocean of Desolation, now whipped into a gray and furious froth. With each step, a tear falls from her cheek. As each teardrop hits the earth below, a small yellow flower rises. She did not notice, lost deep in her thoughts of stormy and joyless nights. Further up the path, she goes. A trail of yellow flowers pursuing her and expanding outward, growing into vast swaths of brilliant color as if begging her to see them. Three months earlier, the Whirling Winds carried away her little sister: Iris. They were together, sitting outside, playing pocket full of posies. Iris�s beautiful blue eyes twinkled. It was pleasant until the Whirling Winds came and snatched her up. Iris was gone in the blink of an eye so short the life of sweet Iris. Like Daisy and Alder, uprooted and carried away by the Whirling Winds. At that moment she became nothing: completely and utterly alone. She arrives at the top of the cliff. Behind her an ever-expanding field of color. Her tears grow, spread, and give a breath of New Life. Suddenly, the clouds grow black and the Whirling Winds begin to rage again. They tear at her clothes and howl in her ear as if shrieking their hatred; Threatening to take her away just like they did Daisy, Alder, and Iris. Following her, the New Life begins screeching back at the Whirling Winds. The noise swells louder and louder reaching a deafening cacophonous roar. It was the roar of love, anger, hatred, angst, sadness, and pity. These noises twist and turn in her head until the Whirling Winds drive her head-first off of the cliff to the ground below. As she plummets, the world goes silent. The Whirling Winds die. The New Life held its breath. That poor conflicted soul hits the ground. Slowly the beautiful products of her tears vanish. If only she had turned around to look back over the village of Gladiolus, she would have seen a vast expanse of yellow tulips. Unfortunately, the world finally lost Joy.

In middle school all sixth graders had to go to this camp for three days. At first it wasn�t that bad I got a cabin with some of my friends and my leader was chill he let us stay up and mess around. The next day we have pizza day (I�m allergic to dairy) and my leader said to get the vegan pizza. So I go up to the people handing out food and asked for the vegan pizza it had vegetables on but i thought to just take it off. After eating it my throat felt itchy and I get nervous so start downing water I went through a whole pitcher of water and still felt weird. After dinner we go to this kind of chapel service and my gut is aching. I go tell somebody that I feel like I�m going to throw up. My teacher comes up and takes me to the nurse cabin and it gets worse so when I�m there I start throwing up and I felt so bad because it was a lot and this poor girl had witness this and once I�m done they ask me if the pizza had vegetables on it. I say yes and the nurse says �ok so they gave you the vegetarian instead of the vegan so just calm down everything will be okay. I start freaking out (which is normal) they call my parents and they learn how bad my food allergies are and they start freaking out they are talking so fast I don�t realize they just stuck the epi pen in my leg I got pretty shook and then the paramedics got there and get me in the ambulance I see people jumping to see who�s in the ambulance then i just think about my friend because he knows how bad it can get I learned he was freaking out all my friends thought I was dead or dying. In the ambulance they gave me an IV and they couldn�t get the needle in and ask if I was drinking water ( I drank 2 pitchers and whole hydro flask of water) it was even harder because the camp was on a hill so they�re winding down this road while trying to stick a needle in my arm. When I got to the hospital my breathing got worse and I was getting extremely itchy and I thought I was going to die. My parents had to drive 5 hours to come pick me up at a hospital after they learned I had an allergic reaction. But before it all I had a gut feeling this would be bad so now I always trust my gut.Thank you if you read the whole thing it can get boring But I appreciate it

In middle school this happened and I�m really shy in real life just as a background So it�s break time and I was chilling after I had gotten my things for my next class ready, pretty normal right? Well the dumb part is two girls walked up to me while I was chilling and not paying attention, I did see them walk up but I didn�t think much about it I thought they were going to go around me or something but no. What happened you may ask? One of the girls asked me to date her and this caught me off guard but not only that there was a crowd incoming that was going to get in the middle of the two parties (me and the two girls) so I fake think about it until the crowd blocks me from their view I join in on the crowd and by the time the crowd passed I had managed to mandalorean sneak my way out of having a girlfriend

An interview. Pitel shuffled on to the stage, taking a seat on a plastic chair. �Comfortable?� the interviewer asked.�Yes... Does it have to be plastic?... The smell... It's so... Potent.� Pitel asked.�Yes... We apologies; we didn't account for your kinds sensitive noses, please overlook it and let us get on with the interview.� �Alright...� �The question I think everyone wants to be answered is, when did you first become an Active?� �... I guess that's a fair question... Always, I've always been active.��And who was your first save?��First, save?...� �Yes, who did you save... Pitel?... Hello?�Pitel wasn't listening; his mind was in a faraway place. Back when he was twelve, and he was out front shoveling the driveway. He remembered it like it was yesterday... A girl he liked who went by the name Mary, always walked by their house, as opposed to taking the bus, even on cold mornings such as that day.Pitel was nearing finishing the driveway when he noticed that Mary hadn't come by that day. A small thing to see but none the less... It was seven. Mary wasn't the type to be late. Pitel decided he would check-up on her.So he put the snow shovel back into the garage and headed over, it was only a block, and he was wearing enough clothes to melt a snowman. He knocked on her front door to find it unlocked and left ajar; it swung open at his touch.�Hello?!� Pitel called out, �Anyone home?� Something hit the floor up stairs with a loud thud. �I�m coming in.� He walked in, shaking the loose snow onto the front steps. Then he headed upstairs, finding the bathroom locked. �Mary?... Are you in there?� he was ready to walk away and leave it were when he got a feeling... It was the first definite time Pitel could recall having it. He jerked to the left, inside a bedroom, narrowly avoiding a knife to the back. Pitel�s eyes went wide as he looked over at the long kitchen knife embedded into the bathroom door, a black-gloved hand clutching it.�Did you try to stab me?!� Pitel would later wince at how obvious that question was, but in his defense, he was twelve.The man managed to free the knife, crouching down, ready to either bolt at Pitel or down the hall.Pitel was just ready to give in, to give him whatever he wanted so that he would go away when he caught sight of Mary. She was tired up on the floor in the bedroom across from the one he was currently in, possibly bleeding judging on the reddish puddle around her. Pitel strengthens his resolve, to hell with just letting this guy get away. �Put down the knife.� it was convincing, very authoritarian, it would have made a raging dog roll over in submission.The man sadly wasn't an obedient dog. He wasn't going to listen to some boy. He lunged at Pitel; then, Pitel had another feeling, this one born out of fear and desperation. Pitel jerked his hand out toward the man, a seemingly weak defense against the knife, that was until the man flew back into the bathroom door the knife embedded in his torso. Pitel watched in frozen shock and horror as the man slid down the door, leaving a bloody smear. Then Pitek snapped out of it long enough to call the police and untie Mary.Later the police questioned him about the event; they were sympathetic toward him. A boy caught in a scary situation alone. So they didn't go into much about the knife making its way into the man. Pitel sat on the steps, wrapped in a wooly blanket, watching the man get pulled into an ambulance, police lights flashing across the yard. His mother's car pulling up to the curb.She wasn't gonna be happy about the unfinished driveway... I�m juat writing. Leave a like if you liked this.

The world feels gray and dull. Meaningless chore after chore, the mind numbingly dull work that you keep doing over and over in the name of a job, the same path travelled over and over again till you don't even think about where you're going, but the kind that leads you. Life feels like it's on auto pilot. Nothing new, exciting or adventurous. You come home, sit at your desk.Suddenly, you make the decision to grab your earphones, and head out to your terrace. You select a song off of your playlist, and hit play. And thus, you are lost. No specific thoughts make an impact on your mind. You are drifting in a sea of thoughts, gliding through them, to no particular destination.The stars twinkle like diamonds across the rich velvety dress of the night. You catch the rare view of a bird making it way across the sky, perhaps going  home to its young ones. It almost feels like your mind and the music has melded into one. Objects around you spring to life. The street light in the distance seem a little brighter, the stars a little shiner, and the sky a tad bit darker. The concept of you, doesn't seem to exist for the rest of the song. It's just your mind wandering aimlessly throughout the world while your body sits at one spot. Time seems to move across all directions. The past is the present while the future seems like something that has already happened. Nothing is certain at this moment, and yet, you are. In this sea of thoughts, you are everything you wished you were, everything you wished you could've done and everything you wished would happen. And then, the music fades away, and the stars are no more. Just an empty darkness where the beautiful night sky was. And as you remove your earphones, the deafening silence washes over you. The world returns to the gray it was, and you return to the monotonous life you live. And the earphones await for their next use, a chance to take you away, a portal to another world.

This happened to my brother 5 yrs agoBackstory: we had a maid who was like 16-18 yrs old (she wasnt part time), she gets to eat with us at the dinner table, get to use our tv, and we take her with us if ever we will eat out, but she was always scolded for not doing her work properly and just lazing around and is always on the phone texting, we didnt want to take her phone because its her joy,.but one day, my dad has had enough, So he confiscated her phone for maybe one week so she could learn her lesson and work properly. Ofcourse she was devasted but didnt really talk back, but we could clearly see her menacing angry face, The next day we went out to buy groceries but my brother and my maid was left at home. So while me and my parents are out grocery buying, she asks my brother if he could go to my parents room and get her phone, and ofcourse he refused, and she kept asking but my brother kept refusing and this got her furious so she started shouting and throwig a tantrum and my brother told her to calm down but she scratched him on the chest (my brother was shirtless) and she ran to the kitchen, grabbed a knife and then ran to the bathroomMy Brother told her to open the door but she refused and say "if you dont give me my phone im going to kill myself" and my brother being 17, he called my dad, so we dropped our groceries and drove home,. My dad wasnt worried that my maid is "going" to kill herself but the fact that she could kill my brother, anyways, we arrive at homemy father then proceeded to knock down our bathroom door  (he succceeded), and there she was, sitting on the floor with her placing the knife on her chest (not like the point part but upright, like how u would hold flashlight to make scary face). And my dad just yanked the knife from her hands and scolded her and everything else was a blur, but she was sent back home the day after i think and my mom gave her P500 so she could go homeThe end lmaoThis is my first post btw hehe

Yeah. You read the title right. When I was 10 or so I was bullied and only had 2 friends (this might seem a lot to people who get bullied really badly, I�m sorry). They were very dear friends, but there was only one who occasionally stood up for me. So, a few years ago, during lunch break, we were sent outside to play. There were some constructions going on there as the playground would soon become a hotel (don�t ask). A few weeks before this guy, we�ll call him �Z�, had an accident and therefore needed crutches (this�ll be important for later in the story). I was playing with my friend, you know, the one who always protected me. I�m going to call her �N�. N and I were casually playing when I suddenly hear Z whistle. He was my classmate so I recognized his voice. I didn�t think anything of it as he does that all the time, you know, to annoy girls. But then he calls my name and tells me to turn around, and being really shy and not wanting them around me & asking me why I�m not turning around, I turned around. Within half a second I see a brick headed towards my way. I have pretty bad reflexes, so I didn�t dodge it. The brick lands right in my face, and as the 10-year-old that I was, I started crying. My nose was broken & my upper lip severely bruised (we went to the doctor after school). The teachers who were outside saw me crying and took me in. They brought me to my own teacher and they scolded Z for throwing a brick at my face. While I was walking to my teacher I see Z well... walking in through the main entrance of our school. He looked really pissed. So, Z and I arrive in our classroom and our teacher�s just sitting there, but not the teacher we had before lunch (we had 2 teachers and they�d switch during lunchtime, because our school had this really weird system). We sit down and I tell the teacher what happened. I wasn�t even finished when Z interrupts me to tell the teacher I pushed him and hit him with his crutches, and that�s why he threw the brick in my face. I stared at him with an open mouth. One of the teachers who were outside walks in. He clearly overheard the conversation and knew Z was lying. So the playground teacher tells my teacher that I didn�t hit him with his crutches and that I was telling the truth. My teacher wasn�t really bothered and said; �well, he may have done that, but I�m not going to ask him to apologize. It didn�t happen under my watch.� Wow. Like 15 minutes have passed since the incident and my mom storms in. Oh, yeah, the playground teacher also told our principal to call my mom. She was absolutely pissed. She doesn�t have a reason to hate my teacher yet, though, so she just greets her in a friendly way. Then she looks at Z and starts yelling at him for throwing a brick in my face. When she was done she noticed that our teacher just finished grading tests and didn�t seem to care. My mom asks her; �so, did he already apologize?�, my teacher responds with �no, and I�m not going to ask him to. It didn�t happen under my watch, so one of the playground teachers should ask him to apologize.� Mom went to the principal about it a few days later, and I don�t know what she said, but a few days later she was gone.BTW, my mom encountered Z�s dad and Z�s dad asked my mom if I actually hit his son with his own crutches. My mom thought he was having a go at her and almost yelled no. Z�s dad said that he already thought so and that he wouldn�t expect me to do something like that. My mom was so embarrassed about yelling at him for no reason, she won�t let me talk about it lmao

One time in 6th grade we had a sub in geography class. Keep in mind this was the meanest and most hated sub in the entire middle school. So anyway there was a really smart, calm, straight A student. For this story we will call him jake. So anyway when we all walked into class and sat down jake asked, �Sir, what is the lesson plan for today?� For some reason this made the sub REALLY mad so the sub (in a full on shout) yelled, �WHY DO YOU THINK I WOULD KNOW THE LESSON PLAN?� Then the sub said (again in a full on shout) �YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU CAN GO OUTSIDE IN THE HALL!� So jake stands up and is walking towards the door as the sub says, �Anyone else want to join your little friend out into the hall?� And to that a kid stands up and says, �If you�re sending him out than you can send me out too!� So another kid stands up and says, �yeah me too!� This repeats until about half of the class is going out into the hall. From here I can�t recall if they all went out into the hall or if the sub caved in and made nobody go out into the hall. Well that�s my story! I hope you enjoyed!

"You took quite a fall there, young lady".Looks painful.�You�re *such* a drama queen�.A hand reaches out from a blur of green and helps her up from the ground.�Come, let�s go� her friend says.She rubs her head as she trails behind her friend, she turns around only to see that the man in green has disappeared.She shakes her head, a bit confused as to what just happened.She scrunches her face but can�t recall anything more than from a few moments ago.They turn the corner.The all too familiar smell of biscuits, cakes and breads wafts over them as they pass the same bakery.Her stomach rumbles, when was the last time she ate?Who knows, she can�t remember.A stinging sensation from her arm impinges on her attention as they walk down the street.She looks down to examine what's causing the pain and doesn't notice the green figure pass right by her.Her arm is grazed badly, she doesn�t know what from.She hasn't noticed the fa�ade yet.As they approach the next corner, her attention is drawn to her legs.They�re hurting, it feels like she�s been walking forever."Wait� where are we going?�Maybe she thinks she has amnesia. "Oh come on, you know why you�re here.�She nods, but shows signs of visible confusion. Her head is thumping from the fall earlier, she rubs her head to ease the pain.They turn the corner and proceed down the footpath.Everyone she passes has a lifeless expression on their face.A busy street filled with people and clothing stores, but not much commotion.As they weave through the crowd of grey a green figure stands out in the distance.Someone wearing a long, green rain jacket.Strange clothing choice for a sunny day like this.She slows her pace and tries to make out his face as he approaches.Her friend grabs her by the hand, �Oh look!� as she directs her attention to a dress in the window.He passes right by her, she turns to try get a better look at his face, but barely manages to make out any detail.The green figure fades into the crowd.She'll soon start to realise.Her friend is babbling on about how much that dress reminds her of her first date.She�s barely listening to what�s being said, she�s heard the same story a million times before.She�s starts to take in her surroundings, as they continue down the street a look of hesitation appears on her face as they approach the next corner.It finally hits her as they move around it.She's questioning everything now.Right on time.She pulls her friend to a stop and turns her around so they�re face to face. One politely smiles while the other has a perturbed look behind their eyes.�What is this place?"A blank stare is all she gets in reply."Where are we and how did I get here?�She looks her friend up and down.Bewilderment comes over her face, "Wait� *Who are you?*"A soft blanket of silence covers the area.One person's footsteps are heard above the rest, echoing off the street. She breaks eye contact and notices the green rain jacket over her friend's shoulder. She breathes a sigh of relief.She tries to push past her friend and moves toward him, but she can't. Her legs are frozen.He starts to get closer, like a predator closing in on its prey. Just as he passes, they make eye contact and she can see it now.It's not what she first thought, it's not a friendly face at all - it's a look of deciet. A thinly veiled smile of his tells her all she needs to know.The reality of her situation has become clear.Her face turns white, fingertips trembling.As usual, her panic overwhelms her and she starts to run. She knows she has no place to go and she knows this, but she continues to run.It's an amusing thing to witness, to see someone so scared out of their mind.In her terrified state she doesn't notice grazing her arm on the corner.As she looks back to see if the Greenman is behind her, she loses her footing.She trips and hits her head on the pavement.It looked painful again, she'll be out for a while. Everyone moves back to their positions....She�s starting to wake up."You took quite a fall there, young lady"

So today, we were doing a greeting in class. It worked like this: someone would say, �Good morning everybody, I feel _____.� And Everyone would respond with, �Good morning! You ARE _____!� This one kid who is my awkward weirdo friend, when it was his turn he said,�Good morning. I feel nothing.�Then this ONE KID, she said,�Good morning! You are nothing- wait��

So I�m from the uk so we don�t really get given a timetable for sports so we really just do random lessons but there is a teacher I have called �rice� (not his real name for obvious reasons) and rice is a really cool guy and he also likes memes except he has a weird obsession for Russian hard bass music so whenever we play dodgeball we either hear Russian hard bass or some dramatic music that makes it seem like the final battle in endgame

This story took place when I was 7 or 8, i had this orange scooter that i loved riding outside, anytime I was bored I just ride the scooter to have fun, I didnt know how to break on the scooter so I just used my feet to stop the scooter, (i would put my feet out to stop the scooter) the thing was that everytime I did that it would rip the bottom of my shoe slightly. One time I was riding my scooter and I fell off my scooter, I cut my leg when I fell I was bleeding, there was dirt around it and I was scared I would get infected but I knew I cant worry about that right know, I knew that i needed to clean my up my blood, So I screamed so loud that my mom could here me, she heard me screaming, I think she was cooking or something cause it took a little bit, but she helped me get up and clean up my blood, I dont remember walking at all,AftermathI remember her helping me clean my leg so I didn't get infected, and she told me "stop crying and relax" I immediately stoped crying (that was the funny part) she got me these huge bandages to put on my leg to stop the bleeding, and I put my leg on a chair to relax, I didn't get stitches but I should have, my leg healed fast after that.

Well as my title says be nice to neighbors, sure there are some who u probably dont know or little communication but just do be bad to them. Here's a story from a few months back. My neighborhood is pretty much normal, not really much going on until the weekends, the casual party and cook out. We arent really into this stuff, in my family we are the only ones who live in this area. The other part live pretty far away so if we have a birthday or something we just go out and eat. There was an empty lot on which my brother and I would play. There was no sign as of now trespassing or anything. Many kids actually loved it there. A few weeks later there were some people going around the lot. We hear someone bought it and was ready to build a house. At first it was sad but hopefully it was good. I was so wrong, the people working on the plot would block people's driveway. They would leave so much trash around. They would be in the back alley until very late at night. Which was a bit suspicious. About a week later of people's complains the owner said he would fix it. It got worse. They would make more mess, we ended up with bags of McDonald's in our yard.Fast forward they finished. Which was good... Until someone broke into our shed in the backyard and stole tools and lawn equipment. Sure maybe it was someone else but they spent so much time in the alley that we just didnt know.The owner rented the house to a couple. And damn do they like to fight alot, idk how many times I've heard the word bitc* from that house. They have loud af parties and they constantly scream at other neighbors. Their kids sometims i see them wanting to jump to our backyard. Which by some reason we make a little noise and they run back inside their home. Is pretty much a mess lately. One of the kids actually put dirt on one of the neighbors cars a last month which damn is going far. I dont like messing around with them or talking bc it can get so loud and defensive. I post this bc i rarely can talk about it with people, Just please be nice to neighbors, don't make their life difficult or mess with their thingsHave a nice day:)

Note: This is only my second post but 1st post on this subreddit. I'm on mobile so please excuse any grammer mistakes that this might have.So this happened just tonight. So I was watching YouTube and I realized that my rabbit (his name is Bean) was still on the loose. So I had to get Grace( Little sister. Not her real name btw) who was watching Spongebob on the couch and we looked for him. But then Grace found a pile of rabbit poop in the bathroom. So while I cleaned that up (gagging all the way through) Grace went and looked in her room. While she looked she  thought she heared scratching noises in her room. So she went and told me and we looked for around 20 minutes (probably because it was a huge mess). When we couldn't find anything I had Grace get my mom and help us look. She got all of Grace's stuff out of the way and lifted up the matteress. Now this is probably the wrong time to tell you this but Grace's support beam under the mattress is hollow. So my mom was about to put it down but then she said she saw movement, so she put the mattress back down and had me get scissors. Then she used the scissors to cut open the support beam and that little brat poked his head out as if to say hello. My mom grabbed him before he could get away and she had us put Bean away. And right now I'm snuggled up in my blankets and writing this to share with all of you. K bye!

The year was 2002 and it was Halloween so our teachers wanted to celebrate it by choosing a topic to make a costume of.The topic was how humanity has evolved Into a better society.my class and I were thinking of a recent thing that happened recently until someone said 9/11.I don�t know about everyone in the world but in my school you must do a short performance about something when it�s Halloween.The teacher who was in the class didn�t care what topic it was just that we did the play.There were barely any rules about kinds of topics so we did 9/11. When it was 31/10/2002 we were hyped for what�s going to happen to us after this.We did our performance and our whole class got suspended for 1 week. We all missed a lot of work while we were gone and we barely passed the exams.

I was 20 years old, walking around town one day trying to approach women,  I saw an attractive woman sitting outside of PetCo smoking a cigarette. I approach her and ask her if i can bum a cigarette, she says yes so we sit down and start smoking and talking, nothing crazy. I end up getting her number and go on my merry way. I really never thought I would hear from her again.Later that day I get a text from her. She asks me if I want to come over and help her do her hair. Roger that. I hop in the car and drive over to her place. We start talking and she starts telling me that her boyfriend had recently beaten her pretty bad and left their house. Red flags popping up everywhere but I keep on truckin. We start playing this shitty old video game on her PS2 (her boyfriend took the xbox with him when he stormed out).We finish playing PS2 and she turns on some show about Lemurs. Some awkward silences and small talk goes on for about an hour. Eventually, we start talking about sex. I ask her about her kinks and strange things she likes. She lists off some BDSM things and then mentions that she had been in a porno before. Well, that intrigued me. I suggested that we watch the porno. She fires it up on her phone and it's a casting couch video, she starts giving me a handjob while we are watching the video. So we continue watching the video and towards the end of it, an old man with a "basketball gut" enters and they have sex. So here I am, getting a handjob from this woman I just met while we watch a video of her getting smashed by an old fat guy.After we finished watching the video I ask her "Alright, whats the craziest thing you have EVER done?" She is hesitant to tell me and says she won't directly tell me but she will ask me a question and let me figure it out. I agree. So she looks at me and says "do you like dogs?" Yep, she had sex with a dog. I ask her how she managed to do that and she said that she posted an add on craigslist and essentially, some guy brought his dog over and it went down.Naturally, I decide I want to lose my virginity to this woman. We talk more and she says she's down to have sex. We walk to her bedroom and she asks me "how many girls have you been with" I got news for ya, I'm a virgin. I tell her this and she says she doesn't want to have vaginal sex because she doesn't want to take my virginity, but she's down for other sexual activities. I suggest that we have anal sex, she says she's down. Welp, we didn't have any lube and I didn't think to use spit. So essentially, It wouldn't go in, after many attempts, penetration was just not happening. (I also had trouble keeping an erection). We call it a night after thatI went over to her house again a few weeks later and we had normal sex. TL;DRAttempted anal sex with an amateur porn actress who fucked a dog

I can see you sitting over there quietly disappointed. You shift uncomfortably in your chair as you look down at the floor."What now?" You exhale. "I dunno..." I look for your eyes, maybe you'll guide me. Give me a hint as to what you want me to say. You lean back in your chair. Our eyes meet once more. I'm ready for you."I can't keep doing this." My heart drops to the pit of my stomach. I can feel my legs quake beneath me. You've never said that before. "I-" You hold up your hand to me suddenly, impatiently. "I've given you so many opportunities." You let out a sharp sigh. "You tell me it'll get better and I just-"Please don't say it."I just don't see where this ends. I've tried helping you, comforting you but it's never enough." You look at me in a way I've never seen. You're exhausted, remorseful. "I dont want this anymore." I can tell it pains you to say it.I open my mouth to defend myself, but what can I say? You're right. Is it better to let you go? I'm not the person you knew or the person you deserve. I take this opportunity to look at your face and take in every ounce of it. Your eyes, your nose and what used to be your smile."Well?" You gesture to me for a rebuttal but I just sink down into the chair behind me. "This is your opportunity to fight for us!" You're angry now as you rise from your chair. "Is there anything left in there?" You're closer to me now as you examine my hollowed out shell. I want to say yes. I want to fight for us! But... I'm not right for you."Unbelievable." You scoff and shake your head slowly as you back away from me. I want to reach out to you to comfort you, but I turn my head away instead. "Goodbye then." I feel you turn your back to me. My eyes start welling up, my chest starts to ache but I dont turn to face you. I dont say a word. You need to be free. You hesitate at the door. Are you hoping for me to call out? Or are you dreading it? Deep down I know it's the latter. You yank open the door and pass through the threshold. You're free. If I was better I would have said what you wanted to hear. I would be the person you once knew, but that's not me. At least not right now. When I am maybe our paths will meet again. Until then..."I'm sorry."

So I was on a week long cruise in Alaska and there were these private rooms you can hang out in. My little brother and I were messing around outside of the rooms and I see one of the doors is open. So I quickly glance in there to see of it was available and I see a middle aged man who has circuit boards and other stuff spread around him. He would mess around with wires and what not connecting them to things and stuff. He was really secretive and would look up every now and then to make sure no one was looking. Luckily no bomb went off and thinking back he probably wasn't making a bomb. There was strong security on the ship but who knows.Was on my phone so sorry for bad grammer/spelling

About 10 months ago I had a house fire, we lost almost everything, except for a few exceptions.January 2nd 2019 I wake up on this day with the plans of lounging around all day, boy did that change. Around noon I was laying in my bed watching YouTube, my phone was charging. Usually my mattress wasn�t touching my wall but a relative came to town and gave me a comforter because she hated my bed and had to sleep on it. So now the phone charger is touching my mattress, and the wiring in our house is extremely old. It sparked and ignited my mattress while I was laying in it, luckily I got out before it reached me, but the fire inspector said I was lucky it happened during the day. My 4yo. brother was in the bath, my stepmom was overloaded and got little done, but she was able to get him clothes (so he wasn�t naked and freezing) while I got him, and our dog, out and outside. The firefighters put it out in roughly 15 minutes and little was salvaged. Other than electronics the only thing saved was my bass guitar, witch to this day smells like smoke. It took 8 months to refurbish the bass and we will be back in our house in two months.They also did a [news broadcasting](https://kfdm.com/news/local/12-year-old-boy-saves-little-brother-from-house-fire) witch was cool.(I�m the 13 year old)

One day in the fourth grade, i was having the time of my life, skipping around with my best friend. He and I have always loved Peter Pan and knew every track. So we were skipping around singing Peter Pan songs. Somebody did not like this so he had to think quickly. As everyone would OBVIOUSLY do in this situation, he picked up a nearby soccer ball and threw it at my left eye. And let me just add that the soccer ball had mud and dirt covered in it. It hurt like shit. I started crying and my best friend walked me to the school nurse. I know it is a stereotype for school nurses to not care, but it is a true stereotype because she gave me an ice pack. Long story short I saw tunnel vision in my left eye because the bud scratched it. every time i would close my eyes for too long (sleeping) my eyelid would tear tissue from my eyeball and make it worse. It pretty much stopped n 7th grade but that isn't even the worse part. The literal only person who cared was my eye doctor. my friends teased e and were like"ooooohh there is your boyfriend" my family only said "it is just because he likes you" and all my teachers did were make him apologize. And obviously he did not care either because he stood 25 feet away from me and yelled 'sorry' and then laughed and ran away. even if he did like me, it was a douchey thing for everyone to do and i am still mad about it. Am I weird?

 I am bread. Bread is life. Bread is death. Bread is you and me. Bread is Earth. Bread is the universe. bread is ying. Bread is yang. Bread should be treasured.   � These are the things you need to remember. Bread is what keeps existence. Crusty outside and a soft inside. Who could've think of that?  � The bakery is my house. I always smell the oddly satisfying scent of fresh loafs. I take a piece, lick the crust to claim it and bread it.  � I have never been caught. Why? Because I am like a ninja running through forests of isles. I pick out my favorite bread and just run.   � I run so swiftly. I am like Usain Bolt in a fairy costume, a cheetah in a tutu, Flash in a dress.   � I am the ruler of bread. White, brown, seeded, cheesy, flatbread, pizza.  � I admire bread from afar and up close. I just love bread.  � After getting to my cave of fluffy, delicious bread, I eat.   � My mouth is surprisingly slow. I savor the flavor,� meet my desire. I just love bread.  � I am bread. Bread is life. Bread is death. Bread is you and me. Bread is Earth. Bread is the universe. bread is ying. Bread is yang. Bread should be treasured. As I'm peacefully eating some beautiful white bread, the FBI (finding bread investigators) comes in with some guns. Of course I am ready for this occasion so I attack them all with my Tiger bread.  � Oh no! I'm doomed, I think to myself.   �� I take 3 hits to my shoulder. Enough to make me unconscious. My breath tastes like moldy seeded bread. I don't like it at all.  �� I still somehow know what's happening out there, even if i'm unconscious. I try to shout help but nobody comes.  � I wake up. It looks like a hospital just worse. A hospital made out of pastry. Yuck.  �� The ruler (I assume) comes up to me. She's pale and quite old.   � Before she said anything, she clutched her heart. I look behind.  �� George Washington!   �� He looks as young as ever. He comes up to me with a sword. I kneel.   � He gently places the sword on my shoulder.   �� I am now queen of all foods! I   � I kiss him. It was sweet, quick but meant a lot.  � He then kneels down. He pulls a ring from his pocket. Yes! I will marry him! I am now a queen with a duke!   �� Later, we go out to eat. I order a soup and bread, (he gets the soup) and the best part is that I don't need to pay because I am the queen of food.

I was 14 and at the time, a huge fan of EDDSWORLD. If you're not aware: Eddsworld is/was a series of animations created by Edd Gould on YouTube. His worked inspired me to draw cartoons and I attribute him as to why I pursued further education in applied art and graphic design.Part of my graphic design class (it was like year...9?) required that we research a known artist and guess who I chose? It wasn't that far fetched: the Eddsworld animations had garnered millions of views and the BBC had even done a report on Edd and his friends. My teacher gave me the green light and I was happy to be researching and creating responses to someone who at the time, was my favorite artist.Some of you maybe aware that Edd Gould would later pass away due to cancer on March 25th, 2012. When YouTuber and friend of Edds Tomska broke the news of Edd's passing, I was devastated. It wasn't quite on the same level as losing a family member, but you have to understand: i'd lost someone i'd looked up to and admired; someone I had hoped to at least meet someday.Couple days later, I would have Graphic design class and just as I thought I was starting to get over it, all the thoughts and memories would come rushing back as I opened my folder and looked back at my research on Eddsworld. But that alone wasn't what made this day traumatizing: my teacher noticed me staring blankly at my work and came over to comfort me; asking what was wrong? I of course explained the situation; that Edd Gould had died and almost immediately he cut me off by replying:"Oh, well you're going to have to make some changes then."&#x200B;And what followed was me spending the entire lesson on the brink of tears as I was told to go back through my work and replace sentences such as: "Edd Gould is" with "Edd Gould **was**" basically going back and writing about how he was now dead while I myself was still trying to get over it. Sure, this may seem trivial and probably somewhat over-dramatic. But I was young, had very little experience with people I cared about dying and I felt like there was no one I could turn to in this moment: my teacher sure didn't care/understand and i'm sure my friends didn't want to be around me should I burst into tears; it would make them look uncool after all.

So i'm a 16 year old boy and im a lonely guy in my school because my friends go to a different school in a different town. My philosphy class was about to end so I started to put my stuff into my backpack. I picked up my backpack from the floor and put it to my desk. Then a pack of condoms just fell from my backpack to the floor. I was with my gf yesterday so I forgot the condoms in there. I started pick up the pack of condoms while the whole class was watching and laughing at me. Thank God the class ended right after that. So I ran to my moped and started to head home. I drove past this busstop where were about 30 students waiting for the bus, and so many people were just staring and laughing at me.

First of all, I'm not a native english speaker and not a great story teller, so please forgive me for that, but I hope this little story going to be interesting anyway. In 2018, I got the opportunity to work at a summer camp next to Brevard, NC, thanks to a company called Campleaders. (I was a 20 years old college student, living in Hungary, Europe). I arrived at the 30th of May, and worked there until the 10th of August. It pasted fast, everything was alright, but the story begins now.  Since I was a teenager, and only had a junior debit card which I couldnt use in America, I couldnt reserve a place to stay on my own, so I had to ask one of my friends at camp to rent me an apartment in Washington DC. He was a really nice guy, so he did this favor for me, and I gave him the cash of course. So after camp finished, they dropped me out at Charlotte and everyone started their little journey. I arrived in Washington with a Megabus early in the morning. I was completely on my own, but I was so excited, I didnt care at all. I was heading to the apartment I rented, with a big smile on my face. Until.. I got an email. They cancelled my reservation, because the debit card owner name and the booking name (mine) didnt match. Not gonna lie, I started panicing a little bit, but somehow I kept my head cool. I thought its a good idea to go there, maybe I can somehow convince the owner so I can stay there and pay with cash instead of a debit card. Well, It didnt happen. But atleast he gave me an address, 2 streets further, where I can pay with cash. So I walked there and stepped in the house. There was a group of people ahead of me in line, so I just stood there and waited..until I heard 4 guys talking in hungarian. I waited a minute, because I wanted to make sure they are really talking in my language.. After I was sure about it, I greeted them in hungarian, they were suprised, so am I, what a coincidence, right? But wait.. We said a few things to each other, until I heard this: Szia Gyurci (Szia means hi in hungarian, and Gyurci is my nickname) I looked up, and next to the counter, there was my fellow classmate from highschool, who I havent seen and talked to him for about 4 years. We were looking at each other, I think none of us believed that we met each other in Washington, 8 thousand kilometers away from home, just because my reservation got cancelled.. After that, I got a mate to travel with.. How little the world right? If nothing goes wrong, or If i get there 5 minutes later or earlier, they check in and probably never meet him after, because the apartment had like 20 rooms in it. Whenever I think about this, I get goosebumps everytime.

Well, yes, but actually, no."M" told me this story while we were talking about the Impossible Whopper.M worked as a sushi chef at a Japanese restaurant. One day, a vegan customer ordered a vegetable roll. Note that "vegetable" doesn't explicitly mean "vegan." The customer complimented the sauce before leaving. A few days later, M realized that, while the roll was vegan, the sauce wasn't - It was eel sauce.M decided to keep the secret sauce under raps, and sold multiple rolls to vegans topped with eel sauce before moving on. Nobody suspected a thing, and every customer enjoyed their vegetable roll.He now jokes about going to hell for this.

So a few days ago I saw this older fellow with a child chasing him. Apparently, the child thought that the guy was his grandpa. The kid didn't even bother to see who it really was, being a young child, and continued telling his story about something and the guy just followed along. Until the kid actually noticed who he was talking to. Oh boy, you should have seen his face. It was a mix of regret and embarrassment, and  the kid just walked away quietly. I saw the kid later that day with his actual grandpa, (very similar looks)and he was suspicious the whole time. I guess it was his first time talking to the wrong person.

I was the third brother of 5, doing what I had to do to survive. I'm not saying what I did was alright, but trying to break out of the ghetto was a day to day fight.

The thing I hate worst about hunting demons is the hours. It sure as hell ain�t nine to five. I�m not saying it�s always at midnight, but it is very rarely earlier. Definitely nothing good happens after midnight.I've been waiting on this one for a few days. The Strauss family had given me the key to their house and rushed out in obvious relief on Tuesday. As I had requested, they had tidied up but not moved too many things. I had come in with my gear and set up in the garage. A military style cot, dried food, two changes of clothes, some basic toiletries, and my box.Yeah my box.It�s important.Years ago, I carved my box from an oak beam salvaged from a burnt down church. I had salvaged several things from that old place after it burned. I had a lot more of the wood, of course.� The firemen had let me in as soon as they had completely extinguished the flames. Some of the metal objects had been quite warm but I figured I owed the congregation my best efforts. They deserved it. I was still pawing through the wreckage when about fifty parishioners showed up with tools and trucks. The had food and drinks with them. Two of the men had gently but firmly removed me from the wreckage and sat me down on a tailgate with a cup of coffee and the best damn egg sandwich I had ever eaten.That was the night my eyes had been opened and my calling made perfectly clear. The night a demon burned down my fucking church. Right before I killed the little hellspawn.These days I don�t get surprised. Some of the tactics vary with the demons but mine was pretty set in stone. As one of my childhood heroes, Bruce Lee puts it, �I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.� My kick is my box.I realize it seems a little weird as a weapon. It�s not so much the weapon exactly as a trap and a coffin. The box is very important and the nature of its making is important and hugely complicated. But in the end it makes the work so much easier. You can do this job without one, I had killed my first demon without one, but the box makes it possible to do so without burning down the structure you currently occupy. Bonus.I won�t bore you with all the Symbols carved into the box. They are important certainly but the importance is directly related to me. If you made a box it would be very similar to mine in many ways. I could use yours and you could use mine. Assuming, of course that you are also a thaumaturge blessed by heaven. A thaumaturge is what they used to call a wonder worker or miracle worker.I�m not making this shit up. Lots of Catholic saints, godmen in India and various other chosen people around the globe have done this throughout history. I can do it but I have no freaking idea how it works. I am satisfied knowing that it does, and I can help people with it.Now sitting in the Strauss� garage over the past few days I have really caught up on my reading. Mostly on my phone but also on my tablet, I devour series and single novels voraciously. If I could just make a living doing this I would be set. I eat a healthy, if a Spartan diet. I have all day to read, exercise and nap. Most nights are quiet and when they aren�t I have the grim satisfaction of knocking another invader off the wall between us and hell.Have you ever looked at your watch, then someone asks you what time it is and you have to look again to answer them? That is the feeling I get when some demon shenanigans are about to begin. Like I did something stupid and I will likely do it again. I guess because the evil of the demon has a range and the perimeter feels more like exposed stupidity than actual evil. Chagrin maybe, I don�t know.I set down my tablet when I get that feeling. I flex my feet in my boots to make sure the are tightly fastened. Standing slowly, I check the function of my joints and do a quick little stretch. I don�t want to pull a muscle for crying out loud. Some of these whoresons can get kind of rough. I snagg the box from where it lays on my pack. Finally, I roll my neck out one more time and walk to the door into the house and open it.As I step through I catch a whiff. Butt funk and honey, Eu d� Demon, my least favorite smell. The Strausses had told me that the demon seemed to begin in the kitchen and then move through the living room on its way upstairs to the kids rooms. I quickly decide to meet it in the living room instead of the kitchen. Too much sharp shit and glass in there.Moving quickly I set the box down on the spot I picked out when I first arrived. The lid opens silently and I get a whiff of the oil that I rub into the wood after each use. It�s a pleasant and wholesome smell that covers up the demon stink very well.I move silently and crouch behind the couch. I control my breathing and begin focusing on one of the small thaumaturgical miracles I can do. It essentially freezes any hellspawn in place for a few vital moments. I�m not one hundred percent sure why this is but it has something to do with how our brain functions versus a demons. Our amygdala is the part of the brain that processes our emotional reactions. Our amygdala loves a surprise. We like scary movies, surprise birthday parties and unexpected events. Even those people who say they hate them enjoy them. Well at least their amygdala has a positive reaction, even if the secondary reactions are not good.I can sense the demon enter the room. The malevolence is palpable. An oppressive wrongness that kicks the senses into fight or flight. It�s time to make my move. My thaumaturgy is ready and I jump up from behind the couch and scream,�Peek-a-boo!�The reaction is instantaneous. The ugly blue/green thing with a clown�s face goes rigid, stiff as a board. I dash in and grab it with both hands and throw it as hard as I can towards the box. I hear the satisfying clunk of it closing, signifying the thaumaturge has taken affect.I have never had the phobia but I do understand why people fear clowns. Something that closely resembles a human face but is slightly wrong in its features and movement makes us horrified. Deep down we know that the smile is wrong and hiding something. Every demon I have ever killed had a clown�s face. Horrifying.�I'm already fixing in my mind the next piece of thaumaturgy and I spin around putting my back to the demon and placing my hands over my eyes. I began to count aloud.�1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi, 3 Mississippi, 4 Mississippi, ��When I get to ten I spin around and speak to the closed box.�Ready or not, here I come.�The box sits there, the lid is closed. I walk to the box and lift it onto the coffee table. I sit down on the couch and stare at the box for a moment and then reach out with my fist. I tap on the lid, the old rhythm. Tap tap tatap tap, Shave and a Haircut...a short silence. Then from inside the box comes the answering taps. Tap tap, Two bits. Got the bastard.Now comes the coup de grace. I focus nearly all my attention on my left hand. I make it a weapon of the light and good in this world. I focus the wrath of God in my hand so that it begins to glow. I hold that power ready.My right hand reaches for the little handle on the side of my box. It is the crank for a music box. As I begin to turn, the tinny sound of the music box floats in the room. I mouth the words to the song as I slowly crank the handle:�Round and round the mulberry bush...The monkey chased the weasel..�I think of all the little children in the world who go to sleep at night with a tiny touch of fear. They don�t know if they are the monkey or the weasel. Do they pursue their goals like their monkey. Scampering and trying to catch the things and people in their life that make them happy. Or do they scamper along in terror and panic? Stressed by the world and it�s pressure and always fearful of failure.�The monkey thought twas all in fun..�I know. I know they are both. I can�t save them from their own thoughts and choices, but I can give them one less thing to fear.�Pop!...�The lid pops open and the demon springs up. It is hideous and ridiculous all at the same time. It slobbers and snots through its horrid clown face. It�s blue hair bounced in ridiculous shoots at the sides of its head. The hands, in fat white gloves, reached toward me.I reach out my left hand and touch the sickly soft fabric of its costume.�You�re it, motherfucker.� I say in a low growl.With the combination of the touch and those magic words, the clown screams. It lays its head back and howls. The hands come up straight in the sky and the entire clown body slumps all at once back into the box. One more scream comes from the box but it trails off. Like the old Roadrunner cartoons when something fell off a cliff. The scream fades and dies. I look in the box just to be sure. It smells like unwashed ass and honey but otherwise it is empty.My right hand is still on the crank handle, I play the last notes.�...goes the weasel.�

The want for more, The desire to achieve as much as possible. That want pushes us through school, work and every day life. That persuit of happiness, the idea of being accomplishment. It has been the goal since the dawn of men. We hunt the weak, we kill animals, we are the most powerful. Yet we're also the weakest of all living lifeforms. Our primitive mind is being surpressed, our desires are no longer ours. We are being told what to desire, told what to eat, how to sleep, how to think. Our freewill is a consept that we are told what we have. I have the right to eat what I want, but yet I need a government forum saying I'm allowed to hunt and fish. I have the right to bear arms, but I have to wait three days along with that gun being tracked. I can't sleep, but I need medication from the government to sleep. It's control, it's power, they have dominanted the food chain. We fight their wars, we eat their food, all while the they our money, take our freedoms and our "freewill".

I wanted to tell this story because it was so wild and I needed to share. Feel free to read, I'll also add a TD;LR here because you may need a preview!**ENJOY BECAUSE IT TOOK ME THE WHOLE DAY TO TYPE:**&#x200B;**TL;DR: Got high first time, attacked my tongue, got high again, got gay asf, texted friends, became Kevin from split**&#x200B;**There are five important people in this story:*** A: A fellow employee who I work with* B: A�s sister, who is also an employee* C: The son of one of the senior employees* D: My dad�s friend�s son, who I met at parties before* and I&#x200B;**Background:**I went on a large vacation to Wisconsin Dells with 20+ other people. This was a work vacation that the boss hosted, and all the employees and their families were invited, including my own parents and sister.We lived in cabins that were small and had only two bunk beds and one queen-sized, with no bathroom. The bathroom was a shared public bathroom that needed a card to unlock because they didn�t want random people to use the bathrooms I guess.We only stayed there for two nights.&#x200B;**DAY 1**On Day 1, we went on roller coasters and go-kart raced for the whole day. After a long day at the park, we went home and got ready for some relax time. We eat some grub and get ready to hit the sack.It is around 8:30, when I get a text from A saying, �Yo, I got some stuff do you want some?�Now, I already knew A smoked. He told me about his wild stories and we�ve always had a blast together. I drank with him before, but I never smoked with him. In fact, I never smoked before at all. So, I was a bit scared. So I texted him back, �I�ll think about it dude, my parents are here. And they know what weed smells like.�And this kid legit replied with, �But dude, it�s Wisconsin Dells!� And that one phrase sold me, I agreed that I would join him later to smoke at around 9. He also informed me that he roped in C because they were sharing rooms. I�ve never met the kid before but he seemed cool.But then, the adults said that the park was still open and that we should go to the pool. So, I got my swimsuit and zoomed to the park. By the time we got back, we were tired, wet, and ready to sleep. Then C�s mom saw me and said, �HighFivo! Where are C and A?� I stood there confused at first, but then the realization hit me: I totally forgot that my schedule was booked at 9 for smoking and I went swimming instead.Slightly panicked I said, �They weren�t with us.� Like that helped her at all, at this point, she was now also panicked because she assumed that they both went with us to the park, and was expecting me to say, �Yeah, they�re right behind us.� Luckily, my dad came to the rescue and said, �They went on a walk.� So now C�s mom is more relaxed and legit grab a cold beer and chugged it down, so I knew we were in the clear.I grabbed my phone ready to send a text to A asking him where they went. I saw that I had several text notifications from A and C asking ME where I was. I realized I never told them we were going back to the park. Turns out these fiends smoked a whole blunt and came back high to the camp.A was chill and started drinking cans and cans of beer acting as usual (the adults didn�t care about underage drinking so he was fine).C was shitfaced. He was staring at the sky and like talking to himself like a complete loon. You may be wondering why none of the parents cared, well it was because they were all shitface drunk too, so they didn�t care. At this point, C�s mom couldn�t even walk and had to go to sleep.I was lowkey sad but it was fine because A picked up on this and whispered in my ear when we were drinking, �My sister is coming and she has more.� Bless this man and his drug connections.We waited for a good hour and A stands up, he doesn�t say anything at all. And starts walking *INTO* the forest. He calls out, �I�m going to pick up my sister in the parking lot.� But the parking lot was in the opposite direction. C, D, and I all stood up and followed him (D came out later when he finished showering) except he disappeared into the night. It was like 12 AM at the moment and the only light we brought was C�s phone and he was still woozy.So we had to find a slightly high, drunk as fuck teen, with the only light source coming from a Samsung being held by another slightly high teen. Let me tell you, we couldn�t see shit.We walked in circles and called out his name. For a good five minutes, we were equally lost as there are many other cabins and darkness all around us. Then C screams, �I found him!�, and points to this figure walking in the darkness. It was A, also holding up his phone. Except he was walking through other people�s cabin areas. We called out to him to come toward us and his silhouette turns toward us and RUNS AWAY FROM US. He is running and ducking behind cars and cabins, but fortunately, he was heading towards the parking lot.In the end, we all made it in one piece and all five of us were together, A, B, C, D, and mE.C and D start walking towards camp, and while we walk A offers me a blunt he just pulls out of nowhere. And tells me to smoke it. I was honest and told him, �How the fuck does this work?� Both he and B start laughing and told me they both forgot it was my first time. Noobs amirite? So they told me to inhale, then inhale again, then breathe out. So I put the blunt�s end in my mouth and sucked in the air, then I sucked in the blunt AGAIN. A then starts laughing, while B was like, �No, no, no, no! Breathe in fresh air for the second time!� Oops. I try again and get the hang of it after like 2 or 3 more puffs. Then I start coughing. I�m coughing and I ask A, �How the fuck do you get used to this�, after seeing him take his 4th puff without discomfort. He looks at me and says, �Well you stop coughing after you smoke it every day too.� That is true.I�m about to take another puff until I hear my dad, who is an alcoholic through and through, yells, �HIGHFIVO IS THAT YOU? IS A AND B THERE TOO?!� He was obviously drunk, but it didn�t help that we smoked two cabins down from our site and that I was coughing non-stop. He kept screaming at us, A was busy smoking in the darkness with only the blunt�s red color being seen in the dark, B was doing I don�t know what, and I was coughing my lungs out since I just pumped them full of drugs for the first time. It was an experience walking back to the camp trying to hold my coughs in, and ignoring my drunk father�s questions. Luckily in his drunken fit, he forgot to drink more and forgot about yelling and started getting more drunk.Now, as it was my first time smoking and the more experienced members were already gone. So, I was on my own to fend for myself. It also didn�t help that D called his friends who, coincidently, were also on their vacation. So 2 minutes after I smoked my first blunt, I was in some random dude�s car in the parking less than 50 feet away from camp, vaping for the first time. For a whole 30 minutes, the whole car smelled like strawberries and sounded like a bunch of screaming teenagers. Because we screamed in that car for a whole while. Then I stepped out of the care to get to bed since it was 1 AM right now.Here is when my mind got a little tipsy. I wasn�t sure how being high felt, as I�ve only experienced getting drunk. So I was here thinking I�m sober then a lightbulb sprung in my head. I need to get rid of this smell since I was sharing my cabin with four other people (I slept on the floor if you were wondering how we fit five people into a cabin with 4 sleeping spaces), and I had to pee really bad. I walked toward the public bathroom and unlocked the door and walked in. At the sink and rinsed my mouth. I gargled some water and spat it out. It was yellow. Now I�m not sure how but, my entire tongue was yellow as fuck.Now, here is where you may be thinking: Brush your teeth. But AHA here is the conundrum. I had left my toothbrush inside the cabin. And at the time I ran the simulation in my head if I went into the cabin to grab the toothbrush they would smell me and therefore defeating the purpose of me being in the bathroom. As I continued to think and gargle more water, I began to bite my tongue and try to scrap the yellow residue on my tongue. I then made direct eye contact with some soap. Now, this isn�t the hand soap in bathrooms, no this was one of the free shampoos that the cabin had. Now I had an inner dialogue with myself about the pros and cons of using soap in my mouth and it ran like this:* If I use the soap it will be cleaned and I won�t smell like weed. But it might taste really bad.* If I don�t use the soap, I will smell like weed. But my mouth will taste okay.Since I was only scared of the taste, I tried a bit. So I squirted one blob on my hand and stuck my tongue inside the blob. Free Cabin Shampoo tastes like nothing initially but has a strong chemical aftertaste. In the end, I rated it a 3/10 since it didn�t taste the same way it smelled. SO I SQUIRTED MORE AND SMEARED IT ALL OVER MY TONGUE. Since I didn�t have a brush I used my fingernails and started scratching. I scratched and scraped my tongue for a good minute. Sidenote: The foam tastes better than pure soap. When I rinsed my mouth and gargled some more water, I looked in the mirror tongue out. And it was the same. But I assumed the smell disappeared, so I left the bathroom and went back to camp.I go to the cabin to everyone already sleeping. I curl up into a ball and open my phone and text my friend about me getting high. As my phone runs out of battery I tell my friend good-bye and I�m ready to get some shut eye. As my body begins to fall asleep, my bladder justs *SCREAMS*. I forgot to pee because I was scratching my tongue in the bathroom. Now I walk outside, the adults are still outside drinking and pay no attention to me. I wanted to go to the bathroom, but it was dark and I left my glasses in the cabin. Being outside already, I wasn�t about to go in again. So I walk around the back of the cabin and just pee. Behind the cabin. Next to a tree. I did this because the tree was in the line of sight to some of the adults still drinking. I finish my business and walk back inside. And fall asleep.&#x200B;&#x200B;**DAY 2**That day was more painful, but more fun than Day 1. The whole day we in the water park, so it helped cool us off from the blistering heat. Except we all got sunburn and suffered without any aloe vera on hand. When we got back it started to rain so had to duck for cover. So we all split up at around 7:30 to get back into our cabins. I was exhausted and started to fall asleep. Then my phone rings to life, it�s A. I pick up, half asleep, �Wassup?� Then he spills out his plans to me, �Hey! Me, B, and C are going to shower. But we aren�t gonna really shower. You feel me?� I felt one thing: Sleep. I reply with, �Yo bro I�m so tired� I think I�m gonna pass.� Dejected that I declined his offer A said, �Awww, okay dude. No worries.� I fell asleep, content that I easily rejected drugs and followed those drug PSA�s. They weren�t that addictive lmao. Then I blackout.I wake up 30 minutes later. \[insert �ah shit here we go again� meme\] Then I call A and say, �Have you smoked yet. Cause, like, I�m down.� Well, I guess Buddha is gonna send me to hell cause I�m doing drugs and I lied to myself. Two sins in less than an hour oops. However, A informed me, �Yo okay bet, but your dad is taking a shower so we have to wait for him to leave the shower room.� By now the rain had stopped so I walk outside, feeling super energetic even though I only had a 30-minute nap. So, it�s 8 and A walks out with a can of beer, as usual, and C is sitting by the picnic tables. We congregate and chit-chat. My mom walks over and tells me to remember to shower. This makes A crack up laughing and C to smirk. Way to make it obvious. Mom is confused but lets it go because she is also hyped: turns out she and the other wifeys are all going to hang out! At the casino. When she leaves, A, C, and I look at each other and smile at each other, because now half of the camp will be gone gambling while the other half will get more drunk. It was like as if Buddha forgave me for my sins and allowed me to partake in the devil�s lettuce.So when all the women leave the men to drink, the three of us escape into the night to smoke a blunt. Now, the plan was to use the farthest shower stall, since it was under the ventilation system and had the most space. But when we arrived someone had it occupied. It was a dent in our plans. Being the mastermind behind this and many previous adventures, he obviously had a back-up plan, �Why don�t we cop an empty tent and smoke in it? It won�t take long so we probably won�t run into someone.� C and I were not for it. A shrugged and went off to hunt down some tents that weren�t occupied. By the time he found one a good distance away from camp, B walked by and asked us what we were doing. We told her our problem and she offered us the safety of the girl�s bathroom. Whatever flags rang through our heads were cut down quick, because she said there was less a chance of women going to use the bathroom since a good 10 of them went to the casino. Whether this was a solid enough excuse or not, we all ran in the girl�s public bathroom to the farthest stall anyways. With a flick of A�s finger, a fire from the lighter, and a blunt being ignited. This was the beginning of Day 2 of getting high. Being the closest to the shower I turned it on. It was powered by a button which needed to be pressed every so often to open the water again. As we passed the blunt around and around, nothing has really happened as we barely talked and passed it around. It was like a hot potato, except everyone wanted to hold it the longest, and the potato was weed, not actually a potato. Loving social interactions, I broke the silence and asked A to do tricks, since he was the master. He blew some rings and as if on cue the bathroom door unlocked and opened. We heard a bunch of footsteps walk around and chatter rang through the air as a whole family, a mom and her children, eager to brush their teeth crashed our session. B was shook, C was scared, I was nervous, and A took another puff. He passed it to me and said, �This is Wisconsin, enjoy it.� So I did. We passed the blunt around while I had to press the shower button over and over to pretend someone was using it, I also used my foot to hit the water to make it sound like it hit flesh and not the floor. By the time the blunt was all spent, we were just waiting for the family to move on. In this time I kept the shower on and my feet were still getting bombarded with a torrent of water. Now, I kinda suspected that weed took time to set in. And we had time. C was gone again, he went the fastest and was wobbling while sitting down. B and A seemed chill since they were standing, waiting. B especially seemed sober as she would peek out to scout the family every so often, during this time more people walked in so by the time the family left, we had more females to keep track of. Lost in my own thoughts, A leans over my shoulder and whispers, �Your feet must be really clean.� I was so puzzled at first, then I looked at my feet. I seemed to have forgotten that my feet were being hit by water for a while now then two-and-two connected and I trying to be sober try to hold my laughter. Except on grunt escapes, and like it was a deep grunt. A, B, and C give me a look of utter shock. I didn�t realize what had happened, then I smiled and turned to A and whisper, �I hate you.� Now a good ten minutes later we are waiting for one last female who is still here, then B has an idea. That we should use towels to cover all the guys head to pretend we are girls. Since we are all high as fuck we thought she was Einstein and followed suit. I borrowed B�s towel as she was going to shower for real beforehand, as A and C donned their towels over their heads as well. We opened the curtains dividing us from the rest of the girl�s bathroom and RUN THE FUCK OUTSIDE. By the time we are outside, we split from each other. A and C were going to for real shower now. And I had already showered so I was ready to walk home. As B was going to leave I run up to her and hug her, I gave her a big ole� hug and say, �Thank you!� She laughed it off and went to the girl�s bathroom. Now being high as the Empire State Building, I stood in the dark, right outside the ray of light from the bathroom. So I stood in the dark waiting for the boys to leave. In this time, there was another man who was on his phone. He was looking over at me because I was some random kid standing in the dark to his peripheral. And I may or may not have smelled like weed, so I guess I was scared. I took pity on him and sent inside the bathroom so he would be more comfy. I looked into the mirror and see my eyes are bloodshot red. At this point, I realize how high I am. So at this point, there are two people in the showers A and C. I guess and open the curtains to the end of the bathroom. To find A who was about to undress. Obviously shaken, he says, �Yo what the fuck.� I don�t even answer him as I grab his head like they do when they kiss. Legit in my head, I was like I�m not gonna kiss him as I bring our heads closer. I overpowered him but he escaped from it real quick. To make him feel better I said, �Don�t worry I�m not gay. I�m bisexual.� He laughs and says go take a shower. Now I was about to follow his advice and go shower but C walks out and I follow him. He is also high as fuck and when he looks at me and smiles and says, �Your eyes are red as fuck.� I look in the mirror again just in case they got redder, and they kinda did. Now he was getting ready to brush his teeth and I had the urge to hug him. So I hugged him. But then I started to spoon him standing up, as he was shorter than me. I put my hand on his abs and pecs and said, �Hmmm, yummy.� He didn�t say anything as he was brushing his teeth. In my head I was like, is this rape? So I let go and went to take a shower.Now I took off my clothes and started to shower. At this time A has his music blaring. And like being horny and high I did the only thing possible. &#x200B;**NSFW STUFF SO SKIP IF YOU�RE UNCOMFY ABOUT PEEPEES AND BOY HORMONES**>!I started sexy dancing. Like the ones that strippers do on poles. I was dancing to the A�s music and having a blast in there. It was a whole horny session, where I played with myself and did it to the tempo of the music. Now I grabbed my pp and started beating him up all good, except I was caressing him instead. If sober I was a boss at work, when high I was like a slave. I made pp-sama feel so good and honored. It was like I danced with him. I gave him a personality basically. Then I started to cry because I couldn�t please pp-sama good enough. I cried out loud while holding pp and the wall. I cried my heart out as I couldn�t be good enough. Then I got like hulked out and angry at my pp-sama, now the slave was gone and I was goin dom on my pp. Like I was angry and beating my meat really hard. I was grunting out loud and my fantasies ran really wild. And like it revealed some kinks, I guess. Then I stopped and thought. Is A also feeling lonely? So I opened my curtains and walked out to his shower. I opened it up and stood in the doorway. A was visibly shaken and I didn�t even wear my glasses, I could also tell with my low-level vision that he was also touching himself. He said, �BRO WTF! GET OUT� Now I didn�t leave. I stood there and contemplated asking if he wanted to shower together. Then I was like, maybe he needs his own time. But it made me feel less sad that I knew someone else was doing it together with me so I wasn�t alone. After a while, he left and said, �I�m going, bro.� I almost laughed out loud, knowing I can last longer than him lmao. I kept at is and beat and beat and I made a promise that if I drank my own cum I would be invincible. In the back of my head, I was like, What the fuck no way. Then I swallowed and drank some shower water too.!<&#x200B;By the time I was done I was gonna grab my towel to dry up. I went to the place where I hung it. Only to find my clothes. I stood there butt naked staring at my clothes. I didn�t have a towel since I left it in the cabin and borrowed B�s towel beforehand. So now, still high as a giraffe, I had to make a game plan to dry up and get all my clothes. I thought and thought, I didn�t want to get my clothes wet because I liked my clothes. Unfortunately, I had to sacrifice one of them and I chose my pants. I left my hat, shirt, and undies in the shower and closed the curtains. I stuck my hands in my pants to hide my raging boner. My body was wet so my pants stuck to legs and stuff. I leave the bathroom and see the same guy who was standing there from before, and I tell him, �Please don�t lock the door, sir. I�m going to come back.� He is also puzzled and in broken English tells me, �Door do not lock. Use key.� True. I begin my trek towards the camp. But I had forgotten my glasses and now the entire place was pitch black. I had to walk with no light, no vision, no underwear, no shirt, and dripping wet. I walked by a whole family and all the kids stopped talking and stared at me (maybe because I couldn�t see their faces), I also saw a flash of a camera. It was a long journey through the dark as I moved around holes, people, and across a road. Now I am walking to my camp area betting on my memory and knock on my door. I knock and knock, my roommates who were 10-year-old kids should have opened the door. I start banging harder and harder. I hear my name being called from behind me, it is one of the adults. He screams, �Your cabin is next door!� just as one of the other adults open the door, his eyes still half-shut as I had just woken him up from sleeping. I mutter that I�m sorry and hear the adults snicker and I walk towards my cabin.The door opens and the kids ask where I was, now I act as sober as possible and say, �Haha! Sorry, I was taking a shower. And I need a towel because I forgot it.� Now one of the kids say, �Didn�t you already take a shower?� Fuck. I forgot that I walked them to the public bathroom hours ago, so I say, �Yes. I did. But I wanted to shower again anyways.� Smooth, real smooth. The kid says, �Okay,� and hands over my towel. Which is still moist from using it not so long before. I walk all the way back to the public bathroom following the same path as before, except before I exit camp my dad calls out to me again, �Where are you going?� I only answer with one word, �Shower.� I walk by the same family who obviously recognizes me as the kids are now whispering and I see a few more flashes of a phone camera. I walk on, relishing in my popularity. The guy who was standing there is gone. Except now there is a dad and his son brushing their teeth. I smile at them through the mirror and walk to my shower with all my stuff still there. I walked in and washed my feet. I whispered to myself, �They miss being clean feet.� I put on all my clothes after drying myself and walked out, and almost bumped into the dad who said, �Oh! I�m sorry�� As he looked at my face. I walked away only to turn around and see him open my curtain to the shower looking for probable evidence of smoking. I bolted out real quick. I passed the same family and heard one more flash, I made it camp quicker now that I could see shapes now. By the time I was at camp most of the adults were asleep.I sat by the open campfire that was started and saw my dad and his friend making s� mores. Now I�ve never made real s� mores at a camp before. So I took my dad�s stick and started to make a marshmallow. C and B were here watching the flame as A was drinking another can of beer. I told C and B that this was my first time making a s� more, so this was the conversation that happened (based on my memories):B: Make sure it doesn�t burn!C: Make it even on the fire. Even it out!B: Wait, you need a cracker.A: Is there chocolate.B: Yes, we need chocolate. A: I like crackers.C: I want a marshmallow.A: Do you want half of mine.C: No I�ll eat only the cracker.B: Where is the chocolate?Now I ate my whole s� more without any chocolate and stared into the flames. And saw Jesus Chris, now people would freak but I was pretty normal. Because I am Buddhist so I didn�t care. My dad passes by and I start talking to him, �Hi dad. I love you, dad. Thank you for making so much food for us. We really appreciate you, Dad. Are you drunk?� He was too drunk to answer me and walked to his cabin to sleep. I went back to my cabin to both of the kids watching TV, I sat down in the corner by the charger and started texting. Because in my head I thought I was dangerous when I was high, I began to prove why I was dangerous to myself. I thought to myself: I almost was going to make-out with a friend and was ready to have fun with another dude I met only two days ago. So I wanted to distract myself from being dangerous with the kids in the room because I was a responsible adult. So I began to text whilst high, my friends and people. I sat in that corner and texted for hours. During that time the kids left to make s� mores, the women came back losing more than they won, and everyone went to sleep. I was still on my phone though and when I texted people I began to fix my grammar and punctuation and started typing like I would for an essay. I had little to no typos, and the typos I did have were corrected with an asterisk. My emotions were also super ranged: from anger, giddy, happy, sad, horny, and weeby. And it all got triggered when people used key phrases that triggered some emotion. I also did a push-up because my friend told me to do it so I did. Then I fell asleep at around 2 and awoken to a new day. Night 2 \[COMPLETE\]&#x200B;**TL;DR: Got high first time, attacked my tongue, got high again, got gay asf, texted friends, became Kevin from split**



******************************



Well one night me and my friend were out walking around and we walk past a car park, we heard people talking and thought nothing of it. About 20 seconds later I tell my friend to look behind us, he did so and couldn�t see anyone at all. I told him to look again and there were 2 hooded men that waved at us and started whistling. We began to speed walk until we got to a corner and ran up another street. We managed to sprint about 300 meters to this secret little footpath and they were gone, like completely gone. We couldn�t hear running or talking, it�s like they just disappeared. It literally freaks me out so much even to this day.

Thrift stores provide a rocky emotional journey, from sad things like homemade Father�s Day mugs to the nostalgia of worn-out Perry Como LPs, every item tells a story. Prized toys cast aside as kids grow up, Christmas sweaters hand-knitted by grandmothers but now too small, dresses or suits worn for dates or weddings or funerals but no longer needed or deemed no longer fashionable -- all of it ends up here. And of course bags of clothing as well as countless boxes of books and household items get donated when someone dies, it all ends up here.One day as I was shopping for a computer keyboard at the thrift store, I wasn�t having much luck, most of them looked beat up or worn out. So I was excited to spot a good one, a shiny black USB keyboard with the cable neatly bundled for only five dollars. Well worth the gamble, it wasn�t like five dollars was gonna kill me.Back at home my housemate Chris was at the kitchen table eating dinner. He was a nice guy going through a tough time; his sister had died only a month before. Somehow he was still going to work and attending class, but I don�t know how he is handling it. And he didn�t want to talk about it. His sister Mary was only 25 but she had taken her own life.    �How�s it going?� he said.�Not bad, I finally found a decent keyboard,� I said.�Cool. If you�re hungry there�s a whole pot of chili,� he said.�By the way, when is the funeral for Mary?� I said.�Next Saturday at two,� he said, looking down.I poured myself a tall glass of ice tea as I cleaned the keys of my new keyboard, eager to get my computer working again so I could get back into my daily writing habit.At my office desk I plugged the keyboard into my PC and switched it on. As I sat in my office chair, my cat saw this as his cue and so he jumped up then settled in my lap. I created a new document in my word processor and got to work. But then suddenly a strange thing happened, the caps lock light blinked on, then off. Then the light began to flash. As I tried to type, each and every key refused to move, as if they resisted each key press.*Oh great, this keyboard is totally messed up,* I thought.But then a few keys did work. So I pressed a few keys at random to see which ones were jammed. I glanced up at the screen, I had typed:*HELP**How ironic,* I laughed and thought to myself.So once again I tried pressing more random keys, but once again only a few letters worked, on a new line I had typed:*PLEASE**Wow, maybe I need a drink,* I thought. Once again I pressed random keys to try to free up the keyboard. I had typed:*THEY KILLED ME*

So this happened not to long ago. We were having a school trip and the plan was to go to a  hotel on the seaside. But we ended up going to the town park because we couldn't find a bus. And the story beggins:The park is surrounded by trees and in the middle of the park  is an memorial  area and at the back was a work-out park.At the left of the park was a road and at the right of the park was an forest.&#x200B;We had around 3 hours before lunch came. Me and my friends were bored because we had to be in a park while our friends from other schools were chilling on the beach. We decided to leave the park and go to the forest. The park on the right side was surrounded by a fence but it was broken. We go thru the hole and see tracks from a vehicle. They were very deep. Probably from a tank. So we decided to follow them. It was a good half an hour walk until we came to an  bridge and when you passed it the tracks went to an open field. We decided to follow them. We then see a sign "MILITARY ZONE DO NOT ENTER" and we idiots didn't go back. We went farther and not even 10 minutes of walking we see a military polygon. We were excited but to the left of us we heard  two guys speaking behind a bush.  We sprinted as fast as we could and they didn't follow us. When we came to the sign I was a little bit ahead of my friends and on the bridge I saw a military vehicle. I told my friends and we sprinted back. The vehicle was really close to me but I didn't see it because of the curve so I dived into the stinging nettle (I didn't think about the pain I was so scared). My friends continued running and they all hided in a shorter plant then I did. The truck passes me  and stops by my friends. I jumped out of the nettle and ran as fast as I could because the truck couldn't turn. I ran back but I tokt a wrong turn and got lost. I didn't stop running and then I saw another sign saying "MILITARY BASE DO NOT ENTER". I turned back immediately and called my friend and god thanks  he answered. We were trying to find each other for 15minutes and we did. We were a little bit early for lunch.I honestly thought that I'm going to die that day but thank god that he didn't kill us or call our parents and just let us go.&#x200B;Moral of the story: Respect signs, don't separate from a school trip or anything similar to that and be cool like that guy who was driving the military vehicle.

Him and her are two young people of 22 and 23 years of age.One day they meet and fall in love and go to live together. They are very in love with each other, but there is a problem: she has no job, she's looking for it, and he looses his one after few days.One day, at the park, she meets a kind old man who goes in that park everyday for a walk. They start to chat, and they establish a good friendship. She tells him what's going on, he is generous and supportive, feels sad about her situation and hopes for her she will find a job soon.Everyday, after spending many hours looking for a job, she takes a break and goes to the park for a short walk and sometimes she encounters the old man too.Weeks go by and neither he nor she can find a job, but still they are in love, they still want to live together, but they will have to pay the rent very soon. She meets the old man again, who notices her worried expression, asks her what's up and she explains him she's very desperate. He understands and offers her such an opportunity: he is old and alone, he has a lot of money, his life is nearly at the end and he would like to feel affection for one last time before dying. He would give her a lot of money if she accepts to be cuddled by him, just for a couple of minutes (note, it's not about a sexual intercourse). She gets scared, says no and runs away home.But as days go by and no jobs show up and the rent day approaches faster and faster, she starts reconsidering the man's offer and thinks that being cuddled by an old man (who is a good friend) wouldn't be that terrible. Moreover she loves her boyfriend and she promised to herself she would do anything for him.She goes to the old man saying she accepts his offer, and she lets herself being cuddled and kissed all over her body. As promised it doesn't last more than an hour and the man gives her a very high reward. And they promise to keep this secret and not tell it to anyone, especially to her boyfriend.At home, she tells her beloved she met an old man who needed a help with his computer and he paid for her assistance, and he will need more help over the next days. He's so happy about that and they start feeling relieved.Over the following few days she goes to the old man again and by the end of the week she manages to collect enough money to pay the rent.Epilogue: Luckily her boyfriend found a job in another city after a few days, so they relocated, she said thanks to the old man and she never met him again. But she was a honest person and eventually she confessed her boyfriend the truth and said that for love she would have done even such a thing, but that she didn't consider that as a cheat on him, as there was no intercourse, nor feeling of love. He understood her and they both soon forgot about those difficult days, as they were living finally happily.Questions:- Do you agree that for love some people are ready to sacrifice their dignity and do things they would never do, but which in turn will save their relationships? - What would you have done if you were her, when you were offered the old man's opportunity? - What would you have done if you were him, when she confessed you the truth?

When I was 12 I had a crush that I had liked since the day I first met her. I ended up asking her out and of course she said yes and we arranged a cheap date after school at 3:45. After school that day my best friend, who I normally walked home with, left very early but I didn�t think much of it since he did say he was behind on some homework. I went home got ready for the date and on the way there I phoned my date. When she answered I heard 1 of my friends talking with my best mate in the background. I thought oh they probably saw each other coincidentally so I didn�t worry too much. I went on the date and everything was normal.The next day before school, I met up with my best mate and we walked to school until we got to the bikes we left in an alley a week ago (those bikes are from another story I have). After that we rode our bikes the rest of the way. I had a bit of homework to finish off so I finished that while waiting for school to start. My new girlfriend walked up to me and started talking to me just as I finished the homework. We had a conversation for about 2 minutes until my friend (the one I heard on the phone the other day) told me he wanted to discuss a homework project we were doing together. He then said that the reason I heard him on the phone the day before was because my best mate was arranging a date with my �girlfriend�. I decided that I would confront my best mate and girlfriend after school since school was about to start. After school my friend tried to leave very early but I caught him up and said I wanted to discuss when we were gonna play some GTA. I immediately grabbed him and slowly pulled him off his bike. He kicked me in the balls but my friend (the one that told me what was going on) ran over and rugby tackled this kid bringing me down too. I got up and grabbed my old best mate. I shoved him against a wall and asked him if my girlfriend was cheating. Knowing that I could snitch on him about cheating on a test he admitted it. I said that he can tell the girl never to talk to me again. When he was leaving I quickly asked him how long this girl had been going out with him for. He said 3 weeks meaning she had cheated on him with me. I explained it to him and we agreed that we would confront her the next day.The next day,me and my friend walked up to the girl and confronted her. She admitted to cheating on him with me and then cheating on me with a random kid without me and the random kid knowing what we were getting into. I told her never to talk to me again and me and my friend met the random kid. He was really nice, apologised and ended up being the girl�s best friend�s brother. I�m just like wait what now? In the end the girl got expelled for manipulating people and getting into fights with random girls 1 of which I ended up going out with.

My niece was in a bad mood so I suggested that she should take a nap. She refused at first then agreed to if I went and watched a movie with her. So I go and watch a movie with her but before she falls alseep she looks at me and says "I don't want to go to sleep" I ask her why. And she says something that didn't make sense. "Maemae we didn't get to spend enough time together." She starts crying as she says this.I'm still confused, looking at her I tell her that I'm right here and that we spent a whole day together. She says "I know but we need more time." I tell her it's okay and not to worry that we'll have all the time to spend together for at least another couple of months. She looks at me and I can see that she doesn't believe me. She layed on me and fell asleep. I just look at her sleep wondering what she was talking about. I had just moved back and I tried to spend all my time with her and her sisters. Later that night she still wouldn't leave my side. Her and her sisters all lay with me, they fall asleep I get up and go talk to their dad (my brother) and tell him what his oldest had said (she's 6). He tells me he doesn't know and that she's probably confused. I don't think that's what it was so I go back a fall asleep. That night I had a dream where I had stabbed a younger version of myself. I didn't know what it meant. But I felt a little different the next morning. My niece's also started acting different around me and I'm typically not a short tempered person but I couldn't do it anymore. I got ticked off with every little thing. I stopped being around them. And now I can't even see them, and I miss them a lot.

I went to Golden Coral one time in this �white hood� area and I don�t understand the appeal. I saw this small child sneeze into the Mac N Cheese multiple times, hacking mucus into it. Then, a while later, an older gentlemen preceded to take a big scoop of the Mac N Cheese and put it on his grandchild�s plate. It�s safe to say I didn�t eat anything else the rest of the night. Imagine my surprise finding out the restaurant got closed, not for health code violations, but for tax evasion.

I wanted to share with you all my creative writing thesis I have been working on for the past semester. I only just finished it for turn-in, which is tomorrow by 5:00 pm.&#x200B;This is a brief snippit from a (hopefully) future novel I will be (hopefully) working on in the future after I graduate next week. It is a mystery/magical realism/epistolary novel set in a small, fictional town in the Northern California valley. A little more information can be found in the \[INTRODUCTION\].&#x200B;It's still very rough, obviously, and there are many loose ends because this is only a fraction of a whole. Also, you will find in the table of contents that there is a "\[CRITICAL APPENDIX\]" that is missing on the document. That's because it's not really anything relevant for anyone but my professor to read at this time.&#x200B;Anyways, without further adieu, please enjoy my thesis:&#x200B;[\[REDACTED\]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xxz9iYj0KVX1l9C0eQxrik2QoVmiFM4a/view?usp=sharing)

Oh boy is this a story. I'll take you back to the worst weekend of my life. It all started on a Friday night. My roommates and I were having our weekly party over at our apartment. This one guy who've I've been casually snap chatting ended up showing up later that night. When everyone was leaving, he asked if I wanted to back to his apartment and smoke. I knew what was up so I obviously said yes. We make it up there, start chatting/smoking; I'm having a good time. You know, one thing lead to another and I asked if we could just go to his room. I DISTINCTLY remember getting up, looking at the couch cushion with my PHONE and JUUL sitting next to each other ON THE COUCH (remember that). I looked at it to say in my head "okay, my phone and juul are on the couch I will remember where they are". Anyways, we're doing our thing and his phone just keeps ringing nonstop. He ended up answering it and had to leave for a sec to go talk to someone. I wasn't really paying attention, so I just thought one of his roommates needed something. I don't remember what lead to me figuring out what was going on, but I just remember laying on his bed, staring at the ceiling and just thinking "That's his fucking ex girlfriend in the other room." He came back in after like 15 minutes and she calls him again, so then he left. again. The funniest part about it was that he going back and fourth between us with just A TOWEL ON NOTHING ELSE. It just looked so bad. But, when he was leaving I asked him to bring me my phone and my juul so I didn't have to stare at his ceiling for another 15 minutes. Well, when he came back he gave me my juul and said "I found your juul but I don't know where your phone is". I was drunk so I didn't pay much thought to it so I just let him leave. This time he was gone for much longer, and I could hear them arguing in the other room so I just put my clothes back on because I wanted to leave. When he came back, I was already getting ready to leave before he asked me to so we were on the same page. I started to look for my phone and this bitch was NO WHERE like literally gone. He was rushing me to leave because his ex was waiting in the fucking stairwell. I told him that I'll just come back tomorrow morning to look for it. The next morning, my roommate and I went up there to look and basically destroyed his apartment looking for it. The only places I was at were the couch, and the bed. Tore up everything and nothing was there. We already suspected that his ex stole my phone before we got up there and he got really defensive when we mentioned it so we just let it slide. The funny thing is though is that he told me he found my juul on a different chair than the couch (like I said earlier, I left both on the couch) so obviously someone moved my things. But, still never found my phone. I don't know his ex's name or what she looks like so I don't know really know how to hunt down this bitch (I'll do it one day). THE STORY ISN'T OVER YET THOUGH OH NO. Basically, I held it together really well that day even though I knew I wasn't going to ever get the phone back. But, later that night we had a party. I was sitting in my bathroom with a couple of my friends chatting. I was sooooo mad about my phone that I jokingly said "I'm so mad I'm going to punch a hole through the wall" and of course my friend goes "Fuck yeah do it!" so I did it. Punched it once, nothing, punched it second time, then realized that I'm not punching a whole through the wall because I was punching the fucking STUD. Then boom. My hand broke. So I was phoneless, and had a broken hand (my dominant hand). This all happened in a span of 24 hours. My luck has only gone more downhill since. The fucking end.

Alright so I was watching a Reddit video on "what's the dumbest thing(s) you've been punished for in school" and I have two situations that come straight out of a villain origin story one could assume and BOTH happened in grades 2-3. Brutal, I know.     So, back in grade 2 when all my friends were gone for a trip I decided I'd play with my Frisbee I bought a couple days prior. Seeing as none of my friends were there, I was just throwing it and running back over to grab it then throwing it again. After a couple minutes of this, a girl comes up and tries to steal it. I hated fights, so I was just trying to tug it out of her hands, but of course, she wouldn't give it back. Then, this guy who looked to be in 7th or 8th grade at the time decided to beat me up over it. He didn't bother asking the situation, he just beat me up past the point I had a bloody nose. I was like 7. This is was the first time I had also said the F bomb because I just wanted him to stop, but he wouldn't. And when he did, at least the girl felt pity and gave me back my Frisbee as I lied down on the grass beat the hell up. Nothing was done about this, I told the teachers and they didn't care an ounce.  Okay so fast forward a year later into grade 3 there was this "gang" of kids, like 3 or 4 of them. They all transferred to the school that year and they liked to pick on me and beat me up at around recess time and sometimes during class time too. I think it was because I was friends with like half the girls in the class rather then making guy friends (yes, I'm a dude. I guess I had a pretty charming personality already back then or something.) The teachers? Well they didn't do anything to them, no, I was always the one who got in trouble. One time I was running from them and I tried to hid in this little container thing behind a baseball field, they found me after looking from me all recess. They laughed and then beat me up, again. Constantly, I'd get held down by two of them (I actually had some-what of a six pack from how active I was outside of school and all the beatings I had taken, so as result I was kinda strong for my age just hated fighting back.) The teachers never did anything, ever. As a result, I was forced to transfer schools and leave behind my childhood friends I had there. I only just got in contact with my one best friend from back then last year.    I still look back on the experiences and ask myself why I never stood up for myself, I really do wonder that.   Either way, I'm not mad that I transferred schools because I had never I would have never ended up in the great school I am in today and became the honour roll student I am.

(Short and simple, but I felt like a hero damnit)I went out to Burger King with my (at the time) six year old brother and Dad. My brother was fascinated with these super tall seats that were at least three and a half feet\~ above the ground, you just gotta know that they're crazy high, especially to a toddler that was three feet high themselves. My Dad allowed us to take a seat at one of the groupings of these. He helps my brother into his seat and we have a fun lunch. After we're winding down and cleaning up, my dad turns his back from us to throw away trash. I kind of stay between them both, not sure where to stand. I notice movement from my brother. I look and next thing I know my tiny sibling tries to get out of the seat himself and ends up beginning to falling head first into the smooth tile floor about to suffer from a concussion at best. My motherly instincts kick in (I am female) and time moves slow as I dash to his rescue. My hands wrap up his head, making sure it receives no damage and I start to cradle my forever baby brother. My Dad turns around and takes in the situation. My brother starts crying, most likely just from the shock of falling. Dad comes over, making sure both me and my brother are fine. And we left.&#x200B;Yup, that was it. But dude, for at least a week after that I felt like a damn super hero.

I�ve currently had 2 hallucinations and they were while I had fever. They�re still very weird and it�s weird the way I felt while having these two hallucinations. The first one was when I had fever and I was trying to sleep. Fever was like 102 or something like that. Anyways right as a was falling asleep I saw myself in my bed, upside down in third person. Afterwards I got up and told my dad �I almost died.� Because for some reason I genuinely believed I almost died. It took me a few minutes to gain consciousness and realize what had just happened but the bizarre thing is afterwards how I ACTUALLY thought I had almost died and didn�t realize it was a hallucination at the time. Really weird.The second story is much like the fourth but pretty different. I was asleep when I awoke in the middle of the night scared out of my mind. I saw lava or some substance slowly consuming my house. I got out of bed and ran to the living room. I could see the substance multiplying, consuming my house. While this was happening I had full feeling and I could think and move while this happening so it was like it was real. I was screaming calling my dad when he came out of his room. He asked me what was wrong when I pointed at the substance. He looked at me like I was crazy but once I told him in a trembling voice he realized I was hallucinating. But i still didn�t. I could see the substance continuing to grow slowly. My dad let me sleep in his room that night. When I was trying to sleep in his bed I slowly regained consciousness and realized it wasn�t real. I went to sleep shortly after.Very weird stuff. I still can�t believe what happened because how bizarre they were. Just wanted to share my stories with someone so thanks for reading!

Long story, but there�s a TL;DR at the end if you�re too lazy.SEPTEMBERMe going into my sophomore year of high school, I didn�t really expect much to change. However, little did I know, 2 weeks into the start of school and I�d be faced with a decision that affected my life completely. I�ve always been unhappy with who I was in my school, I didn�t really have a definitive friend group that particularly liked me or cared for me at all, but I did have a couple good friends that I could rely on. With the same thing that happened last year being imminent on happening again this year if nothing changed (which was just me getting depressed) I decided to make a decision that quite literally changed who I am. The decision was whether I cut off everyone from the friends groups I was in, despite them being my friends since I moved to this area which was 4 years ago. Cut them off, and join a new friend group that would care for me and actually be what friends should be but at the cost of getting into stuff like vapes and drugs in school. Or keep my current friends and stay as the innocent somewhat nerdy and quiet kid I was. I ended up changing friends groups and cutting other people out of my life. Which I have to say, I don�t regret that decision in the slightest. It�s been the best thing to ever happen to me. So with me, and my new friend group that actually liked me and did stuff with me, I was as happy as I could be at the time. In one of my classes at school, there was this girl that I was really into, and I actually made progress with her through all of this too so I was even happier. However, I was also kind of scared of everything because I�m one of those people who feel like they just bring bad luck everywhere they go. First time hanging out with this new group, I still felt the same about that. One of my friends in that group ended up losing feeling in basically his whole body, having seizures, becoming super pale, etc. We almost called an ambulance for him, and I couldn�t help but feel it was my fault because I felt I brought bad luck. He got better after two hours or so of just that, and things were fine again. I got picked up, went home, blah blah. OCTOBERFast forward to October, more specifically late October. I�m still as happy as I�ve been with this new friend group, and they invited me to go to a corn maze for Halloween, which was a blast, it was scary, it was nothing short of a good time. Fast forward a couple days later, it was almost Halloween, and they had this thing at a park near my school for where there�d be a bonfire and fireworks for Halloween. I was gonna ask out that girl I liked and go there with her. Turns out she already had plans that night, which didn�t really surprise me, but I was pretty bummed about it. NOVEMBERFast forward a week. It�s almost my birthday and I ask this girl if she wants to come hang out with me and my friends for my 16th birthday. She said maybe, but she was busy and might not be able to come but she said she�d try. I also got her number out of that conversation, so I was hyped about that. My birthday comes later that week, on a Friday. I was so excited for it and thought I was gonna have so much fun just hanging out with friends and stuff. I also had it planned that this would be my first time trying weed. And which I did, at lunchtime so I also showed up to my class high. It was no big deal or anything but, at that lunch hour, after I toked, me and my friends went to a grocery store to buy drinks and food for me so I wouldn�t get caught and stuff. I wasn�t feeling anything from the weed so I went and bought everything, but as I paid for my stuff, it hit me and I just stood in line for a few seconds doing nothing after paying. After that, the girl I liked came up behind me and said asked what�s up. Seeing how I was high for the first time and I saw her, I just responded albeit awkwardly and walked away. Turns out none of my friends could even stay after school and hangout with me that day too, so I was pretty bummed out about that. Fast forward maybe another week, and I was hanging out after school with one of my friends. He also happens to be the ex-boyfriend to the girl I liked. I resisted asking him about her and saying that I liked her cuz I didn�t know how he�d react. But eventually he found out from another friend in our group that I liked her. Basically, the first thing he did was warn me about her and how she wasn�t that great of a person and will never make plans with you to do anything. At the time, I already had hung out with her outside of school once and were making plans on hanging out again. He was surprised and then wished me luck with her. A day or two later he comes to me and said he had a talk with her about me and confirmed to me that if I asked her out she�d say yes. I was so stoked after hearing that, but after that, every time I tried getting any alone time with her to ask her out, I�d get cock blocked by at least one of her friends. This went on for a week or two. And the stress of it was getting to me. I started having small mental breakdowns to myself about it just from having these emotions bottled up for so long now and knowing that I can finally get them out. Eventually, one morning before classes, I found her with her friend group. She had known I was gonna ask her out from my one friend who actually told her lmao. Her friend group all split up so I could ask her out. She said yes. I was so so so so SO relieved and happy. I�d never had such strong feeling for a girl as much as her. She always felt different than other girls I liked, and she actually ended up being my first girlfriend. I asked her out on Black Friday of all days, and I went to the mall that day with some friends. She was in the west side of town so she wasn�t able to tag along or anything. At the mall, I started planning our first date. We settled on watching Bohemian Rhapsody in theaters, because she really wanted to watch it. I also got stuck at a city bus exchange that night with some of my friends. We were stuck there for 2 hours. At night. We�re in Canada, and late November is when things start to get pretty cold, especially at night. I almost didn�t have a ride home that night so I got scared about that lol. DECEMBERCome December, me and this girl are having some pretty good times. We�d stay after school every now and then and just chill out and talk. Which I thoroughly enjoyed. I was madly in love with this girl; I couldn�t get enough of her. Eventually, her parents wouldn�t let her stay after school anymore so we got a lot less time together. It�s also worth mentioning that I basically ended up leaving my friend group to be with hers just so I could be with her more. I didn�t like her friend group, and most of them didn�t like me either. I had become a lot more outgoing and overall extraverted that year, but around these people, I became more awkward because I felt that they were all passive aggressive and just didn�t like me overall. I put up with it for a while, while she never hung out with my friend group. The only way I stayed in touch with my friend group was skipping classes with some of them. Which I highly regret because my marks in school started to decline very quickly. After a while, my girl was starting to get a bit upset that we hadn�t had our first kiss yet despite being together for 3 weeks at this point. I had heard this from one of her friends. The one that I actually had trust in. I hadn�t kissed her yet because I didn�t feel like I had a good opportunity. Her friends were always around, and they always gave me a condescending vibe so it just felt too awkward for me to do so. I was getting really stressed about this. Seeing how Christmas Break was coming soon, and I wasn�t gonna be able to show up in the last day of school because I wanted to go to a party for my friends birthday but my mom didn�t want me to. And she threatened to keep me from going to school that day just so I wouldn�t go. So on the Thursday before Christmas Break. Me and my girl went out for some alone time at lunch break. I had gotten her a Christmas Gift that I gave to her then. It was a ring that I bought for around 50-60$. She liked it a lot I think so that made me happy. The pressure for our first kiss was definitely there. And it honestly intimidated me so I didn�t do it then. However, before we started walking back to school, I explained my situation with her friends and how I couldn�t be myself around them. I was worried that she would lose interest in me for not being myself and instead being this awkward kid. She understood where I was coming from and agreed that she would hang out with my friends more. After that, we started walking back to school, and just before we lest the area we were in, I stopped her, and we had our first kiss. I was happy about it, she was happy about it. Everything was great. December had turned out to be probably the month I was the happiest, maybe out of my entire life. I loved this girl so much. I hadn�t told her that yet cuz it felt too early still. But holy, I loved her so much and I wanted her to be happy more than I did. Hell, I even felt that about my own friend group. They were all like family to me. Life was great, I loved everything. Next day came, last day of school. I ended up going to school and I went to that party. Me and my girl met up right before I left to go to the party and we said bye to each other for Christmas Break. We kissed each other goodbye since I wasn�t gonna be able to see her during the break, nor after the break for reasons I�ll get into in a bit. At the party, I had a good time, had a bit too much to drink and ended up throwing up quite a bit. My friends called my mom to pick me up since it got pretty bad. She picked me up and brought me back home. She wasn�t mad at all, but boy was I hungover the next day. During that day, I also got out of bed and found my vape in my school bag. I didn�t use it since I figured it wouldn�t be smart using that on a hangover. So I just put it under a hat in my room since I was too tired to put it back in my bag. Turns out when my mom got home, she started doing cleaning in my room. And of course. She found my vape. She immediately knew what it was, and I lied to her and said I was holding onto it for a friend. My parents bought into it and let me go to the mall to give him �his vape� back. I just gave it to one of my friends to hold onto for a bit. This was the day after Christmas. And me and my girlfriend also met up at the mall that day too. I had 2 of my friends and she had around 5 of hers and her little brother. Of course, I ended up leaving my friends to be with her and her friends. Which in retrospect I regret since it was not fun. Once we met up, we walked to this one store outside of the mall, and her and her friends tried on clothes will I waited outside of the change rooms for what felt like an hour. After that, we walked to a Wendy�s for food, I couldn�t even sit with my girl because her friends immediately sat with her. She went and ordered food, I offered to pay but then one of her friends offered to pay for everyone else. While she was up ordering with my girlfriend, her other friends stayed back at where we were sitting and just started to tease me for how slim I am and on how my girlfriend was too good for me. I didn�t really mind it. But what I did mind was her friends asking my girlfriend to break up with me CONSTANTLY. They even asked her right in front of me. That kinda pissed me off but again I didn�t think much of it besides that. After Wendy�s, my girl started feeling sick. Turns out she caught the flu and she also started throwing up. We went back to the mall and she was still feeling kinda shitty. She told her friends off so it was just me and her for a bit. I helped her through what she had and actually had some decent time with her. Thank god she told her friends off. I didn�t feel like I could talk or had a voice with her friends. After that day. I left to go to my hometown for a few days, which was in a different province. I was there for New Years with my childhood friends. Every day though, me and her would face time. Sometimes for only 10 mins. Sometimes for upwards of an hour and a half. However. New Years Eve came, and it was less than 15 mins until New Years for me. I was an hour ahead of where I usually am so it was a little over an hour for my girl. She FaceTimed me just a bit before New Years for me, but she ended up hanging up on me for seemingly no reason. She got mad at me apparently and I got really worried. One of her friends; one that I didn�t like in the slightest, reached out to me and told me that she was just having a pretty serious mood swing and it wasn�t my fault. This reassured me a bit, but I put more trust in this person too. However, whenever I tried to talk to my girl, she didn�t wanna talk to me and I just felt like I was pestering her and made things worse. I left her alone for the rest of the night after wishing her a Happy New Year in her time zone. She was giving me more and more dry texts so I left her alone.JANUARYCome New Years Day. I didn�t get any sleep from the previous night because I was worried about my girl. I give her a text when morning comes and ask how she�s feeling and all. I was extremely stressed out from the previous night. I talked the situation out with one of my friends that I was with. My friend who�s also her ex. And one of her friends that I trust. They all said that I should break up with her. It wasn�t just due to that factor, it was us never really having time together anymore, her never making an effort to be around my friends, or her never really doing anything about her friends intentionally trying to piss me off. That day I called her with the intention of breaking up with her before I made up my mind in what to do. We talked about what happened last night and she didn�t think much of it, despite all the stress I went through. Then her plans for the day was watching Bohemian Rhapsody with her best friend. Which is what I was planning to do with her as our first date. It annoyed me a little but it was nothing to get mad over if you ask me.  Later I call her again with the intention of breaking up. She caught the vibe that that�s what I was going to do, so when she asked whether I was breaking up with her, I couldn�t bring myself to do it. I loved her a lot, and I was willing to put up with more of it, so instead, that�s when I told her I loved her, I also gave her a pretty large text telling her how I feel about her. She was really happy about it all. After that day, I went back home, coincidentally, she also left to go to Mexico for 2 weeks that same day. We also weren�t able to talk at all during her time in Mexico. Her parents didn�t allow her to use social media so the only way we�d be able to talk was over text, and she told me for whatever reason she wasn�t gonna be able to talk. School started up again while she was gone and I was missing her a lot. Keep in mind, almost a month of our relationship was technically long distance. We weren�t able to talk at all between the 3rd and 18th of January. And we didn�t see each other from the 26th of December to the 21st of January. I was missing her so much, and when she finally texted me saying she�s home, I was really excited. She always had plans that she had to go to on Fridays so I didn�t ask her if she wanted to do anything, plus I figured she�d just want to rest when she got back. Turns out she immediately went and hung out with her friends that entire weekend. Whenever I tried texting her, she just gave me some dry texts and said she had to go a couple minutes later. This was all of our conversations since she got back. It really worried me and I figured the had lost interest. First day we�re able to see each other in person again comes around. It�s the morning at school, a bit before classes start. No hug, no anything from her. She didn�t talk to me at all, hardly even looked at me. She was ignoring me. I instantly got really stressed and ended up skipping class with one of my friends. I wasn�t going to be able to focus in class I was so stressed so I figured that�s the only time I had a somewhat good reason to skip class. (Good reason in my mind anyway) A couple other of my friends ended up skipping as well and came with us. Eventually my friend that I was originally with got into an argument with his girlfriend, and he wanted to be alone. So I went off with my 2 other friends there and explained to them why the both of us were so down and mopey. It was the first time anyone from my school had seen me cry. I didn�t want to lose her. I really thought she was going to break up with me. I ended up going to hang out with her and her friends at lunch. She was still ignoring me for the entire lunch hour. I wanted to say something but I just couldn�t. I feel powerless around her friends. As if I don�t have a say in anything and I hated it. We went to class after that, and it was the class I had with her, so I went. Still ignoring me. But our teacher put us in groups. Since he knew that me and her were close, he put us together. I took this as an opportunity to talk to her. Turns out she was just ignoring me because she was moody about some family problems. Which I understand. But I don�t understand why she took it out on me. And why that way? Regardless, I gave her another chance after that. Two days later. It was our 2 months together. So I spent the entire day at school with her. I still kinda felt as if she was losing interest. But at the end of the day she surprised me by doing something she hasn�t done yet. She leaned in for a kiss for the first time, usually it had to be me who did this, but that time, albeit a small thing, caught me off guard. Next time we saw each other it was on catch up days at school, so they were optional. I wanted to catch up on all the school I skipped, she had to go for some exams she missed while she was gone. It was the end of the semester so she missed quite a bit. When we saw each other there, she started talking about how she�s sick again and she said she might die from it. I was concerned but I didn�t think it was anything that serious. She showed symptoms of having low iron levels. My sister had the same thing so I didn�t worry too too much on it. Still a bit worried just in case. She said she was worried because of something that�s common in her family but she didn�t say what. The weekend came after that and some shit went down. She went to another town for a curling tournament or something. She went with a few of her friends, some are guys, some are girls. At 1AM I get a Snapchat from one of her friends. I was up watching Netflix, so I checked it. He explained how there was a screw up and said that one of the guys had to share a bed with my girlfriend. And it ended up being one of the guys I liked the least. I said it was okay, as long as they weren�t close or touching or anything. He sent me a pic of the guy in the bed with her almost cuddling up to her and his arm around her. I got kinda mad and told the guy I was talking to to move his arm and smack him and tell him to fuck off. He did that, and the guy who was in the bed replied with �no promises� After that, I was ready to fight the kid over this. I was pretty upset over it, which is pretty rare for someone to make me want to fight them. I�m a pretty humble and easygoing kid so yea. Monday came along and I talked to my girl about it, she just said she didn�t wanna talk about it, seeing how she was asleep when the whole thing happened, I respected that. Later that day, I found out from one of my best friends (the one who�s her ex) that she told him that the whole thing was just a prank the guys did that she found funny and wanted to play along with it. She also told him not to tell me. But since he�s a loyal friend, of course he told me. I wasn�t so much mad that she was in on it (don�t get me wrong though, I still very much was) I was more mad that she wanted to keep it from me. After this. I made up my mind that enough was enough and that I was gonna break up with her the next day. After learning this, she showed up in my class with one of her friends to say hi to someone. She never said hi to me, but she just looked towards me. I didn�t mean to, but out of pure instinct I just glared at her once I noticed she was there. Later that day, I stayed after school. I was high on an endorphin rush and felt like all the constant stress I�ve been feeling for this month was finally lifted. I also saw some friends and met up with them. They had a joint so I smoked that with them. Then, only then did she text me. Only when she was concerned about something. And I was pissed with her. I gave her her own treatment and was dry, and told her I knew what she fucking did. After that she went silent and just said she just wants to talk about it tomorrow. Her friend that texted me on New Years also texted me asking what�s up. I explained what I said to my girl, blah blah. Next day, I break up with her first thing in the morning. I didn�t want it to come to this but I didn�t feel like I had a choice in it anymore. I kept in touch with the couple of her friends that I trusted. It hurt me to do what I did. I loved her so much and after everything that happened, I was just pretty emotionally and mentally hurt. After a whole month of nothing but stress, I got pushed to my limits. All of this after the month that I was happiest...FEBRUARYFebruary came with nothing but problems. I was still really stressed with everything that had happened in the last month. It was also her birthday within the first week of the month. Me and friends went to the mall that day, she ended up going to the mall that day too. It was very awkward between us but I made a small comment directed to her, nothing mean or anything. You could tell she was hesitating whether she wanted to reply or not. She always complained about me being awkward, but she never took the time to actually see what I�m like away from her friends. Besides that though.. One of my good friends started to literally die. He almost had a liver failure and the hospital didn�t have any donors. Luckily it didn�t fail, but instead now he has stomach issues and a plethora of other problems that we don�t know of yet. He�s missed 2 months of school because of all this. One of my best friends and his girlfriend (who I�m also very good friends with) got into some shit. I won�t describe exactly what it was but it wasn�t good. Basically our entire friend group split up. One was dying at the time, one only hung around us for the guy who was dying, so she fucked off when he didn�t show up. The one best friend was always caught up with his girlfriend and they always did their own thing now. Two other guys in our group just do their own thing. It�s been left to me and another guy who�s one of my best friends.MARCHFriend who�s been in the hospital for a month and a half at this point came and hung out with me and the only person in our �group� now at my place. Fun night, he starts showing up to school again now. The one girl who�s only around us for him is back to obsessing about him. It�s gotten really bad, and it was already bad when I started hanging out with them. One day, it�s four of us; most it�s been in a long time. The one girl keeps complaining that she�s sore, one of my best friends makes a comment saying that the other has been in the hospital and is on the strongest painkillers the hospital has. Girl brings up that she can complain because she had cancer so she knows what pain is. Me and the other guy are completely baffled at the selfishness that just came out of this retards mouth. She also later complains that we�ve been bad friends to her because we didn�t do anything when some guy called her fat. But we did do stuff, we told him to stop, but it�s not like we can physically remove his ability to call someone fat. That night I lose it on the one girl for being too obsessive about the one guy and that our entire group is done with her. She starts avoiding everyone in our group and hogs the one guy away from us everyday now. Week before spring break comes. My friend gets his drivers license. Me and him start hanging out almost everyday and drive places in his parents car while he insures his truck. After a couple days into spring break, I leave to Arizona with my dad. Start missing my ex again because I always talked about coming here with her. And here I am writing this.TL;DRI ditch some previous friends to hang out with a new group, basically redefining who I am and I get to meet a lot of new people. I fall for a girl who I eventually get with, and then break up with her after 2 months. Feeling emotionally and mentally distressed, everything went from the best part of my life to probably one of the low points of the last 4 years of my life. Nothing goes right and everyone I care for splits up into different groups. I start feeling down about everything that�s happened in 2019 so far.

I go to a somewhat large school with 3 floors, the third being very small. My 3rd period math class is on said floor. About 25 minutes ago I was in math class, having done all my work already, playing on my phone. I started a ranked game of Hearthstone and it was going into the late game. I had just used my Bloodreaver Gul�dan and was set up for a long drawn out fatigue match, when the dismissal bell rang.I panicked and grabbed the only thing I brought to class, my jacket, and rushed to the back of the classroom to put away my calculator before the horde of my classmates got there. I rushed out into the hallway and into the only men�s bathroom on the floor. No one uses this bathroom as it�s very small, dimly lit, and very creepy. I didn�t care though as I just wanted to finish my match.When I opened the door, a wall of shit scented stench attacked nervous system. I was like a helpless Syrian trying to survive a gas attack on my stick hut village. The odor was unbearable but I had to finish my match.I pushed through the putrid stench and tried to get to the first stall. When I opened the door, I saw the cause of the odor - a giant pile of toilet paper and shot that overflowed the toilet. Time stopped when I looked at it. It was horrifying yet incredible. It was like a car crash you couldn�t look away from. The toilet had no water in it and the bowl was caked in toilet paper which clogged the drainage pipe of the toilet. On top of the toilet paper was a literal mountain of shit. It appeared to be several different colors and textures, suggesting it was more than one persons shit.After coming to my senses like Tom Hanks on the beach of Normandy in Saving Private Ryan, I slammed the stall door shut, gagged, and got into the second stall. This one was clean. By this point you�re probably wondering why I didn�t just stand in the hall to finish my match. The answer to this question is that I�m retarded. I sat on the toilet and wrapped up my turn in the match, carefully clearing my opponents elementals so they couldn�t create any more via Frost Lich Jaina, and thought this was the end of it. Then the door to the bathroom is thrown open. A thick Mexican accent rings out �Damn who the fuck shit thenselves�.I don�t reply. He proceeds to turn the sink on and begins to piss into it. I am horrified. To my surprise, my opponent concedes. I am now stuck in this stall with a sink pisser right outside. He leaves the sink on and walks to the other stall. He says nothing about the mountain of shit. The beaner then begins to slap the walls of the stall and start rapping. It�s quite obnoxious and sounds like a generic beaner anthem. (I�m not sure why when he saw the shit, he began to sing).By now, I want out. I speak up, �what the fuck are you doing�. He replies with �who are you�. I tell him to fuck off and that Im trying to shit. He says �whatever puto, this is my bathroom�. I flush my toilet, knowing there was nothing in it but I had to keep up my act of shitting. As I begin to unlock my stall door, he locks himself in the shit stall. I am pleasantly surprised but at the same time horrified as to why he did this. I begin to wash my hands and when I�m drying them off I hear grunting from the stall he was in... and then a plop.He had shit on the shit.It was at this point I realized that the mountain of shit wasn�t from multiple people, but was an amalgamation of one beaners dropping since god knows when. Realizing this, I ran down the main stairwell and got in my car to write this story. I am horrified and don�t know what to do. I don�t think our janitors clean that bathroom regularly as no one uses it. Should I tell someone? What do I even say? I don�t know who the kid was but I do know he didn�t have a class on the third floor the same time as me. There�s only 3 classrooms on that floor and there are no beaners in them. Whoever that kid is, there�s a special place in hell for him. I�m going to go get some Wendy�s now. Thank you for reading.

Buckle up folks, it's long oneThis was 7 years ago, but I still can remeber this.**Unimportant Details** (I was 8)It was spring break and I was in the car with my family (mom, dad, two brothers) to some tax agency or something after leaving from my cousin's birthday party. It was raining and we were on the freeway. I remember playing this one Phineas and Ferb game for the DS on my 3DS and I also had a book I was going to read in case the 3DS died. I also had glasses and have given them to my mom to clean them because they were smugded up. (She never did clean them or gave them back). I was playing the 4th level in the game (which was fucking shit), which I got stuck on.**The Incident** After I failed again, I looked up (I was sitting in the middle seat) and saw a car spinning out of control infront of us. I thought *Oh no* and the next thing I knew, the two cars hit eachother. Immediately, me and my brothes start crying because we were all in pain (and I was also crying because I though I lost my 3DS, before I realised my youngest ((sitting to the left)) brother had somehow caught it).Some nice people pulled over and helped me and my family out of the car and sat me and my brothers in theirs until the ambulance came because it was raining and me and my brothers were crying until they showed up3 ambulances came, one took me and my mom, one took my younger brother and my dad, and the other took my youngest brother. It the ambulance, they put my neck in a brace because I had a huge scar (from the seatbelt) going across it and cut most of mine and my mom's clothes off to see if anything else was wrong.**The hospital** Fortunately no, and we made it too the hospital and they put me in this room and I started crying again. This was because I thought I lost my 3 favorite things. My 3DS, My Diary of a Wimpy Kid book (the first if you're curious), and my glasses. Luckg they showed me a bag with my stuff and my clothes all together, but I was still sad that I couldn't see.They did some X-rays and rolled me out to a room full that had my family in it, (my dad and mom to the left, and my brothers to the right). We laid there for a while and gave me an my brothers Teddy bears. Me and my youngest played together from our beds, while my younger one seemed to be unconscious.I was feeling uncomfortable and I asked if I could get up. A nurse help me out of the bed, but something seemed really wrong with my legs, so I had to get used to it and walked to my parent to talk with themEventually, some of my older brothers and sisters showed up to take some of us home. They took me and my Dad home.It was dark and I was feeling uncomfortable because I was afraid of being in another accident (and fucking up my neck more), so I took my bear and put it between me and my seatbelt.We got home at 10:13 pm, and I layed on the floor in the living room while my dad sat on the couch. We watched a movie for half an hour before I got tired. I tried to sit up, but my back was so fucked up, I had a lot of trouble doing this. Eventually, I figured it out and went to bed.**The next two weeks** were awful. School started again arould the same time my neck became covered in tiny, itchy scars. I kept scratching at them and They kept coming off. I also had lost my glasses and had to wait a while before I could get new ones. I haf to sit directly infront of the board because I can't see. And I still couldn't see.My mom had fucked up her leg, so me, an 8-year-old, and my younger brother, a 6-year-old, had to push my mom and my youngest brother in a wheelchair around.**A while later**. After my mom could walk again, I had my body checked out. Apparently, the accident fucked up my spine and now one of my legs is longer than the other. 2 years later, we discovered my younger brother broke some ribs, so my family sued the other drivers and now me and my brothers have a savings account.**I could never forget this and I'm still glad that we made ot out of there alive and still are to this day**

Hi everyone, my name is Becki Percy and I tell my story of child abuse, child trafficking and ritual abuse on Youtube and Twitter. But I wanted to come over here on Reddit to try and awaken more of humanity. Society is so brainwashed to think this stuff doesn't happen. But the fact of the matter is, while you're reading this, some child somewhere is getting abused and sacrificed. Let that sink in. &#x200B;Anyways, I am here if you would like to ask me questions to better educate yourselves. And I would ask that you would please share my  [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ2WchHhGBXo7AF8z9lS5aA/videos?view_as=subscriber)

So I was in Washington DC to pick up my sister from some sort of college trip thing, the roads were busy and it seemed fine.Then we turn down a street that's completely blocked off by police cars and moving trucks, so we thought something was going on. The trucks had some sort of company on them.We look in between the card and see a sorta weird police car from probably the 50s or 70s (this probably wasn't part of the set, but im putting it here incase it was)We look up the company from the moving trucks and they have a website, took a bit of research before we figured out it was the making of Wonderwoman2#TL;DRA bunch of police cars and moving trucks blocked off a bunch of roads for a movie set, researching the company on the trucks, we found out it was the making of Wonder Woman2

I took the elevator up the fourteenth floor and did the same lap I do everyday. Talk to Gary about Sundays game, rant about the Jets, nod my head at Ben and sit down at my 5x5 life draining cubicle. You see, I had ambitions, I wanted to be the youngest VP of our firm, I had great ideas. But those ideas were shot down and so followed my ambition. I put in the bare minimum at work so I could get my pay check and pay the bills. Put a little torwards savings, pay the rent and buy the groceries. The American fucking dream.My passion for my hobbies dwindled and so did my will to live. I wasn't going to off myself but fuck, some days that sounded better and better. At night my thoughts would haunt me, if you get into your head to much it could eat you alive. I had enough money saved and I did something I dreamed of since I was a kid, I bought a motorcycle. Some called it a midlife crisis, fuck they were probably right. But did I feel alive, every waking moment was thinking about my next moment I could ride it. Going to get groceries? Fuck it, take the bike! Going to meet friends for drinks, taking the bike!I was let go from my job because of lay offs. Fifteen years with a company means shit to the corporation I was a slave to all these years. The first time in my life I had balls to do anything uncomfortable, I got on my bike and started riding. I didn't stop, I had no plan but I wanted to explore.

  ***Alright, so let me explain this, there are two stories I am here to tell, so these will be very, very long, sorry if you leave though, but read on if you would like! (Both these stories are true.)***  **Story #1:** It was a few days before Thanksgiving, and I was in the 3rd grade. After we left class to go to recess, we spent a little more time there so we could eat outside. There was a Bahama Bucks truck outside my school, and it was a treat to all the kids who paid for it from a flier. So I was eating with my friends, and I remembered a video I saw from Smosh about Santa Claus. The video in specific was "The Big What If", and I remembered a part of Santa being a drug dealer, and I remembered I laughed hard while watching that. So generally, little 8 year old me decided to tell my friends at my table the scene I saw, so I told them.Me: Hey guys, ho, ho, ho.I splat a piece of ice cream on the table and pretended it was the cocaine from the video, then pretend I'm the Santa in question.  My friends laughed, but my teacher overheard the situation and stared at my friends and me, but we didn't notice. I remember that she then walked up to me and then told me that I was in big trouble, and I didn't understand. So after recess, she took me out of lunch, and then basically said that she reported me to the counselor, so I started crying because I didn't understand. I remember then the principal called my parents, and when I got home from school, my mom was pissed and grounded me. That same day, the cops came to my dad's workplace, and patted him down because they taught he was giving me drugs, and when they told him what occurred at my school, he was pissed.   They actually taught my parents were giving me drugs, and my dad threatened to disown if I didn't tell him the truth, and I was so confused. It was all crazy, and the next morning, my dad had to take all my stuff to the police station so they could investigate all my stuff, it was fucking crazy. But, it was all dropped after they found nothing in my stuff.   So in the end, don't joke about drugs in front of about 5 8-year old children, or your teacher will report you to the fucking police. Onto the next story!  **Story #2:** Again around holidays, this second story happened about like, 10, maybe 9 days before Christmas Break. I was in the 5th grade. So let me tell you what the fuck happened to me in this story, you will believe how **FUCKING DEAF** my teacher was.Again, it was 10 or 9 days before Christmas Break, and my class just finished taking a math test, it was a mid-chapter assessment that everyone had to do before the end of the 2nd Quarter of the school year. So when the whole class was done, we got to do whatever we wanted, but when my teacher was picking up all the papers from the tables, she got my table, so I picked up the papers from my table, organized them, handed them to my teacher by saying 'You didn't get  these papers, **\[TEACHER'S NAME\]**.", and at the exact moment that I was about to finish my sentence, a kid screamed "**DEEZ NUTZ!**", so generally, my teacher taught I said "You didn't get **DEEZ NUTZ**!", and she got triggered, but she misheard me, and then she told me after I said that, that "I would be going to the principal's office after recess with an O.M.R \[Office Managed Report\]." And then 10 year old me was fucking confused, because I was wondering why 8 test papers would get me in trouble.   ***Fast Foward to Recess***  At recess, there were 5 classes there, they were all chatting and playing, and it was **loud as fuck**, so I couldn't hear a single thing. I got out  of where I was sitting, and went to go sit with my friends, when I heard a person saying my name, so I looked around, then I see my teacher standing in the corner, she giving me an angry stare, confusing me. Then she was telling me to come to her with her fingers, so I did as she wanted me to.   I walked up to her, I wanted to know why she was telling me to come to her. She then told me what I did was 'wrong', and she handed me an O.M.R.  she then told me to explain to her what happened. I stammered when I said, "Basically, I was handing you the papers, and I told you "Here's the pap-", she cut me off and told me she didn't want to hear it and that I was lying to her.    She took me out of lunch to take me to the principal's office.  I was confused at everything, and when the principal asked me for my side of the story, I told her the truth, and she accused me of lying. I started crying like a pussy, and when she told me to tell her the truth, I told her, she didn't believe me, and she didn't even bother to look at the security camera footage, so this bitch is trying to get me to confess to a lie. I acted like the lie was the truth, and it was over, which is what I thought. They called my dad, they called the **FUCKING COPS.** After my dad got back home from Christmas shopping, the cops came to my house, and told my dad that they don't deserve to have me and that he shouldn't have me.  After my mom picked me up from school, I saw my dad in the backseat of my mom's car and he was concerned about me. He then said "**Who was the girl involved in this**?" I told him there was no girl involved in anything, I didn't understand it. He was also accusing me of lying when I told him what happened. He told me about what happened with the cops. My sister went to the same school as me at the time, so we were both picked up at the same time, so they went to get some groceries while my dad and I were still in the car. I tried to calm him down, and he simply pushed me back.  My dad said that the police would put me on a probation. **FOR FUCKING WHAT? 8 PAPERS?**  When my mom and my sister came back in the car, they drove to my sister's math tutoring classes at a library. I wanted to be away from my dad with my mom because he scared me in this situation. My dad told me to '**Say goodbye to your mother and your sister"**. I tried to get away from my dad to go to my mom and sister, but he got in the driver's seat, honked the horn until I got back in the car, and it scared me. My dad got me in the car, and he said he doesn't want me anymore, and that I should be put up for adoption. Apparently, the police gave him the choice to put me up for adoption for up to 4 months. He drove me to the police station and got out of the car and then told me, "**Stay inside, because I will get the cops to come out here with handcuffs to arrest your fucking ass**."The cops never left the station, so that was a good sign, but my dad said that they would file a report.  I was grounded for a month, with no access to technology, or the outdoors. During the time that this situation was going on, I spent 3 days on Lunch Detention, so I ate lunch in the principal's office. It's been a year, but me and my dad are in a better state. We both laugh about it over dinner now. He recently told me the probation thing was real, but the adoption thing was a lie just to scare me. Moral of the story? ***Don't talk while handing papers to your teacher, or else they will fuck up your personal life by miss-hearing you.***

It was a normal day at school. We were sitting in class, reading our books, blah blah blah.We hear a "beep beep beep, HARD LOCKDOWN, beep beep beep" from the intercom.At this point, we all knew that our lives were basically at risk. Anyways, we followed the procedures. We dropped our books, ran to the corner, and sat in an L-style. Our teacher, who was basically panicking, shut all of the windows, and locked the door, at a super-sonic speed.A few minutes pass, until we get a "beep" from the intercom. It was our principal."False alarm!" she said.We all sighed in relief, and returned to reading.In conclusion, this is still unbelievable to this day. I understand we all make mistakes, but something that bad? Welp, this post is not to rage.

I live in South Africa.I don't really have much money but I've been feeling real terrible lately so I thought I would treat myself to a MC Donald's value meal.Well I get there the till is rather crowded, however the seating area is all but empty. I get my food and my ice-cream. I just want to be left alone in the corner of the seating area.I face the corner turn my chair so I can have privacy. That AC was refreshing.There was a little table Infront of me but it was kinda pushed into the corner.Well as I'm finishing my plain vanilla ice cream cone two women come sit right Infront of me at this quished table in the corner.The place was empty. They literally could have sat ANYWHERE. However they chose this cramped spot Infront of me Christ  I just got up and left.Ice-cream ruined.I can't believe it, obviously it should have appeared I wanted to be left alone and they blatantly did this.You tell me why.Why for the love of God.

TL;DR my loud neighbours got mad at me for eating the plums that feel into my yard.So my family and I moved into a house a couple of years ago, right away we started having problems with our neighbours, this is a story from about a month of living here.We have 3 small children (all under 7) who go to sleep pretty early (about 7:30) and most of the time in the week my neighbours are okay but, the weekend is a different story. Without fail they have a massive party which goes on for hours with loud music, lots of drinking and constant shouting, the whole shebang So my neighbours have a plum tree right by the fence, the tree is massive and despite this fact, only one small branch hangs over our side.The plums would fall off and into our garden and we would take them and put them in out fruits bowel, we never tried to pick them seeing as it felt a bit rude but if they ever fell off them we would snatch them up. One day I was was hanging out washing and i carelessly picked up a couple of plums that had fallen onto our yard them began to walk away. Before I could even take one step I heard a voice Snap at me from the fence, it was one of our neighbours. Her:�those are my plums� Me: �well they fell into our yard so�Her: �I don�t care this is my tree so give them to me now�Usually I would have just handed them over but I already had a grudge against them for being so damn loud every weekendMe: �if you don�t want us taking your plums then cut off the branch�Her: �No! Then I would get less fruit, just give me the plums when they fall off�Me: �well I like plums so I think I will keep them�I walk away quickly and pretend I didn�t hear her yelling at me for being a Thief.They cut the branch off the next day.

so here's a short one for you all to enjoy, not very eventful, but, you know...this happened last nightso I live in a small town (10,000-15,000 people) and most people here live in decent sized houses, in fact half of the houses are double story, more or less, so people have money, so for that reason you can do stuff here that you otherwise couldn't get away with in other towns, or god forbid, the city, like leaving your bike unchained at the local shopping center, or not stress to much about walking the streets at night. so that's the general vibe.&#x200B;so last night I'm on the ps4 playing the forest with a mate, i play on the family TV, because I'm still only 17 (parents wont let me have a TV in my room), beside the TV is a huge window, probably about 2.5 meters, or 6-7 feet long, and behind me is another huge window with a sliding door, its summer at the moment so the blinds are all up to let sunlight in during the day, the sun only going down at 9 o'clock at night, but its about 12 o'clock probably when my dog, Molly (who was sort of sleeping) randomly got up and started looking out the window and whimpering slightly, I thought nothing of it, as I have chickens in a semi-rural property, where i live, there are foxes literally everywhere, but I didn't investigate because i had already locked their cage, I have a gaming headset on plugged into the TV, but can still hear whats going on around me, I notice my dogs behavior and think sarcastically "either Matt's at the sliding door again, or I'm getting stabbed tonight" (Matt, my brother, has come back late from work in the past and has knocked loudly on the sliding door to try and scare me before, so i didn't even turn around to grant him the satisfaction of the scare, but anyway, i play for another hour before going to bed and thinking nothing of it.&#x200B;\>>next day (lol)walk in to the same living room around dinner time, on the news, a report on Sudanese gangs yadda yadda yadda... 10x the likely hood of....yadda yadda yadda. i notice my parents are talking about getting a new dog, listen in and relise they're talking about a German shepared, a big dog, not a small dog, I'm like "what the hell, why a big dog like that?" &#x200B;so apparently a bunch of houses in MY STREET got broken into.\>me realizing half an hour ago\>>late at night\>>>last night\>>>>only one awake\>>>>>the dog looking out the back window\>>>>>>all the blinds where up, visible from the outside\>>>>>>>I never looked back, I never checked the chickens\>>>>>>>>only door in the back that way locked\>>>>>>>>>me realizing we were nearly burgled\>>>>>>>>>>me realizing i nearly called my own stabbing&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;

One time I was in a conversation about what the worst type of humor is. My friend said that they don�t like self-deprecating humor as it is used by �people who are not funny, and can only make fun of themselves� without thinking, I responded �That is soooo me� then proceeded to slap my self in the face after realizing what I had done.

One night after playing The Witcher until about 5am,  I took out the empty pizza boxes to the bin and I looked up to a beautiful star filled sky. As I wonder about all the amazing things hidden in space on star looked strangely odd. I'm pretty good with planets and can normally tell when I'm looking at jupiter or venus but this star was brighter and had a ring around it. I couldn't believe that I'm looking at Saturn, I mean I can see Saturn's ring. I sat down and smiled to myself, started thinking about life and good memories while looking at Saturn. The orange glow of the sun started to peak but it revealed something, a horrible truth that would make me feel a right idiot. I realised that this 'Saturn' I've been looking and taking pictures with my phone and uploading them to Facebook was actually a broken street lamp. A BROKEN STREET LAMP! I felt so stupied but thanks to that moment it reminded me of the good times and forgot about the bad... And the pizza boxes. I'm new to Reddit, I hope you liked my little story.

This was a couple years ago, around 2011 I believe. I have 4 siblings, two younger and two older, and since we were all very young, we were extremely hyper. My mom, being a single mother had a hard time taking care of us so, she just let us do whatever most of the time. We all loved jumping, so we had a trampoline, but on rainy days, we would just jump on the bed in the guest bedroom, since it was large and could fit all 5 of us. This entire week was rainy, so we were bored. One of my siblings had the idea to jump on the bed. All of us liked the idea, so we went into the guest bedroom and began to jump. It was fun and great until my youngest brother fell off, hitting his head on the dresser. We all went to my mother, panicking because he was crying and screaming. So, she called the doctor. The doctor told her what to do, and also mentioned keeping us away from the bed for a while, so that the rest of us don't get hurt. This was hard on my mom, her being so busy and having to take care of my little brother as well. Fast forward to the next day. It was still rainy, so the 4 of us were very bored. We had nothing to do. If we played tag or hide and seek we would surely knock something over, and there were no board games in our reach. Then, my youngest sister suggested to go jumping on the guest bedroom bed. The rest of us said no, since the doctor said that we shouldn't. My sister, being as stubborn as she is, ended up convincing us to go jumping. Our mom wouldn't hear us and there's less people so more space on the bed, so there shouldn't be any problems, right? Wrong. My older sister got knocked off, landing headfirst onto the carpet. We didn't know what to do. If we went to our mom, she would know that we went jumping even when we weren't supposed to. Our sister was hurt though, so we went anyway. Our mom is nice, so we got off fine.  All of us except for my older brother have medical conditions, so when getting cured, we need different kinds of care. Before this week, none of us had hit our heads like this before. So, my mom called the doctor again. The doctor told her what to do, and emphasized on not letting us jump on the bed anymore. My mom was even more stressed now. I feel like if we were older, she would've said something, but we were just kids. Fast forward to the next day. Still rain. My brother's not doing well at all. My sister has a huge headache is throwing up a lot. My older brother, younger sister, and I were sitting on the couch, still very bored. Again my younger sister suggests jumping on the bed. My brother and I refuse, saying that one of us could get hurt. My sister kept begging until my brother gave in. I didn't. The doctor had emphasized on not letting us jump. They had promised to be careful, so I gave in. As you would probably expect at this point, yes another one fell. My little sister fell and slid across the floor until her head hit the wall hard. She was the youngest of us all, and the most sensitive. I swear to God, that was the loudest crying and screaming I had ever heard and probably will hear. My brother and I, scared, picked her up and ran to our mother. She was tense, but still didn't yell at us. Again, she called the doctor. She told my mother what to do, and once again told her NOT to let us jump. She seemed frustrated at this point. Fast forward to the next day. My younger brother wouldn't stop complaining about how much pain he's in. My older sister needed quite a few pills, but still kept throwing up. My younger sister was probably feeling the best of the three, though she still had horrible stomach pains and lots of numbness. My brother and I were sitting in the living room watching TV, but the signal cut out because of the thunderstorm. Now we were really bored. We knew not to jump, so we tried playing some hand games. We quickly got bored. I said to him that it would only be the two of us jumping on the bed, and that it's large so we have a lot of space and wouldn't fall. He agreed. Surprise, surprise, another one bit the dust. It was my brother. He jumped too high and too far sideways, so he fell and hit his head on the ceiling. He was crying. He was heavier than I was, so I practically dragged him over to our mother. She seemed angry, but again, being the nice mother she is, she didn't yell at us. She called the doctor again. I could swear they almost fought a bit. The doctor told her what to do, and really passively aggressively told her not to let me jump. My mom lowered herself to around my height at the time, and grabbed my shoulders. She looked me in the eyes and told me NOT to jump on the bed. She didn't want all 5 of her kids hurt. She had so much on her plate already, and as more of us got hurt, she got more and more stressed. Fast forward to the next day. I woke up pretty late, and the power was out. I was bored out of my mind. All of my siblings were hurt. My younger brother hadn't gotten better at all. The meds weren't doing much. Same for my older sister. She kept vomiting. My younger sister was doing a little better, but the stomach pains and the numbness still continued. My older brother had nausea and would get dizzy if he even stood up. I was a bit proud. I had been the only sibling to not fall off the bed. I wanted to challenge my skills. It's a king bed, and only one kid. It's not like there was anyone who could push me or make me fall. I was jumping and it was going well. At least for the first 10 minutes. I was jumping and had kind of twisted my ankle if you get what I'm saying? I fell sideways, practically head first. I didn't want my mom to find out, since she had emphasized so much that I don't jump. But I was out of luck because my mother heard the thud. She found me, and called the doctor. The doctor was kind of frustrated, but kept calm and told my mom what to do. She said to keep a very close eye on us so that we don't jump on that bed again. She said this very condescendingly. She took me to her room, with my other siblings. My ankle was hurting so much, and I had a major headache. My mom sat on the bed with us and just looked at us. She shook her head and chuckled a bit, "you little monkeys."

So I was chilling in class, sitting on the TA couch on my phone, and then a mf roach falls from the ceiling into my shoe, (my jeans were cuffed) im sitting there for 3 secs wondering what the fuck am I going to do? and I finally do a weird kick thing and it falls out and I kill that shit, life flashed before my eyes when it stared moving and shit



******************************



To set the stage, this happened in April - May 2014, not sure of the exact date. I do know it was around 11pm on the night that this happened. Anyway, let�s get into the story�So, my friend John was over for a sleepover, we were up pretty late; i was playing final fantasy 13, and he was watching YouTube videos on my iPad. The room was only lit by the TV, of which I was gaming on.So, I was there minding my own business, just playing final fantasy, when he randomly gasped and threw the iPad. I went over to see what he had seen, and it was a weird sight: on screen was a bug eyed man - pure black bug eyes, no shine -, he was sitting down in the lower half of a bunk bed, and the room was lit by a lamp on what I presume to be on a nightstand table. It started speaking, but I could only make out a few random words, the rest was pure gibberish.After a few seconds, John clicked the skip ad button, and he went back to watching Skyrim videos. We both let out a collective �what. the. fuck.� and went back to doing our own thing.About an hour or two later, I thought of checking the video history to see what the heck that ad was about. Unfortunately, the video did not show up in the watch history, not even a �removed/private video� tag with a missing thumbnail� nothing.I still get chills remembering it. I just talked to my GF about it tonight, and we both agreed that I should post it here to see if I can get to the bottom of it, and possibly find the video in question.��Edit (10/15): I�ve talked to my girlfriend at length about this, and she suggested the idea that it was an ad for some youtube horror channel; however, she did say that it was unlikely, as it wasn�t Halloween, and ads like that are usually created to build hype for something. Also doesn�t explain why the ad didn�t show up in watch history, which I find really weird; for that matter, it doesn�t explain why no one else seems to know of the ad, and how there�s no record of the specific ad.The only meaningful suggestion she gave me was wayback machine, but I don�t think that would work because the video wouldn�t load properly, and I don�t think ads are saved in the archives - I feel that wayback machine will be useless. She also recommended searching for a list on the YouTube site of ads they�ve hosted, but I�m pretty sure something like that doesn�t exist. I�ve used youtube for 9 years, and I�ve never heard of any feature like that.And no, I can�t get in contact with my old friend to see if he remembers anything about it. He stopped being friends with me in my freshman year of high school, moved across the country, and his cell number is out of service (assuming it was changed), so finding him again is not an option. I also don�t have any mutual friends between me and him, at least as far as I�m aware, so pretty much no leads there.I was thinking of potentially contacting someone like ReignBot or ScareTheatre eventually, as they might�ve recieved a story of something similar and assumed it was either fake, or a creepypasta. From there, it would at least confirm that I wouldn�t be (as far as I know) the only one to see this ad.Thank you all for reading, and I appreciate the support. I will continue to update with new information as needed.

I�ll keep this concise. Started getting acne when I was 12. Progressively got worse over the years, reaching its worst point when I was 15. I�m 16 now. About four months ago I started trying a new routine (African black soap and shea butter, for those who are curious) and things began to look up. Finally, yesterday at school a girl next to me says �your skin looks clear� and, guys, I wanted to cry. Finally after years of hating my skin I�m finally getting better. That is all, hope you enjoyed.

I was in the gym deadlifting while my phone hanging by the headphone jack. Suddenly people I knew came over, one patted me on the back and my headphones came out of the jack. Suddenly and album cover appeared. DMX anime remix. I had listened to this song on soundcloud about an hour before. I realised I had only one option. I dropped the 40 kg weight right on my phone screen.

Yes, I consider it a career.*Eat me.*Basketball in middle school was a huge deal to me and it was special because I discovered my love of the sport in 7th grade. Don't get me wrong, I still love basketball now-- but those years were especially worthwhile because I was noticing real growth in my athletic abilities.*I was able to run for more than 3 feet without dying.**Success.*In 8th grade, I tried out for the middle school basketball team.*And I actually made it.**Huzzah.*It was a bit of a shock to me and I got my Target-bought Jersey soon after. One of my close friends also made it, but another close friend of mine didn't make it even though he's pretty damn good and he's even better than me now. No matter at what sports level you're at, bullshit politics seem to always finds it way. There were dudes who made it, who really shouldn't have. But since they knew the right people, they made the cut.*They probably also fondled the Coach's balls.*Once I walked those halls and the ladies noticed my Celebrity A-List Status...*Nothing happened.**At all.*Only one of my teachers thought I was a cool cat and that's because she played basketball herself like 256 years prior.�For my first game I was kinda nervous, but excited. It was an away game and I was actually starting. I really don't remember much in terms of the specifics of what went down, but I know I scored one lay-up and one free throw up until the�Moment.We were in the fourth quarter and the Score was something along the lines of 26-25. We were down by One.�With about 30 seconds left, I got the ball and went up for a shot near the basket. It was for the win.*I fucking missed.*But, I was fouled!�*Finally, a chance to lose my virginity!*As I prepared myself to take the free-throws, one of my teammates came up to me and told me this: "Don't miss, pussy boy."*Joking.*"One to tie and two to win, you got this dawg."*Yes, thank you for that.**My nipples will sweat less now.*As I prepared myself to achieve ultimate victory and sink the free throws...something happened.*Something beautiful.*A couple of seconds before I shot the first one, a Girl YELLED out my name (I lied it wasn't beautiful, it was ugly like her)."C'MON SPENCER!!!!!":O*This bitch.*I bricked it.*I'm so clutch.*After that disaster-- I felt increasingly nervous and I knew I had to make the second free throw. I breathed in and out. I prepared my amazing shooting form and shot the ball...*You wouldn't believe it.**I fucking missed again!*There was a mad scramble for the ball, which I'm pretty sure ended up in the opposing team's hands and we fouled them to stop the clock. One of their players made the free throws and we ultimately lost.*Not my fault.*Whatever, at least I didn't try to score in the wrong basket.*Whoopsie. I shouldn't have said that.**Oh, well.*Unfortunately at that point in time my skills and abilities weren't up to par. I wasn't the solid shooter I am now.*I make 2 out of 50 shots now.**I'm a sharpshooter.*I shot the ball from way behind my head and I was only good at driving to the basket and getting rebounds. After that game I was pretty disappointed with myself, but I remember not really caring that much. After all it was just middle school and not the end of the world.*Yet.*Plus, if that Girl hadn't shouted out my name during that crucial point I would've made both AND lost my virginity in the same day.*Guaranteed.*So, I blame no one but her. Afterwards, some of my teammates talked on how it was my fault we lost the game because I had missed both free throws.*Not true.**Scumbags.*But, my teacher stuck up for me and my friends who were in that class with those particular teammates of mine let me know what they said.*This is what real friends are, ladies and gentle-snakes.*You wouldn't believe it, but after that first game we went on a pretty incredible streak.�*We lost four games in a row.*So, yeah losing that first game might've set the tone for the rest of the season. Although we did win one game by forfeit (fuck yeah) and we won the last game of the season because the other team literally had like 4 players.*We won by 3 points.*�*We literally almost lost to 4 players and their imaginary fucking point-guard.*I really did ruin my middle school basketball career.*Oh well.*

Yeah, I thought you had to shake dairy milk all the way up until I was 16.To be fair, I grew up drinking soy milk, which you do have to shake, but when we switched to dairy when I was 11 or 12, absolutely no one told me we didn't have to shake it. And for 4-5 years no one corrected me on it.Not my proudest moment finally being corrected by my mother during breakfast.

High school isn't that fun, I think we can all agree, but this week in particular just grinds my ass. (In an unpleasant way...) 2 Test and one quiz in Science, one test and quiz in English and one test in Spanish. All taking place tommorow. Keep in mind we've had other quizzes and test sprinkled throughout the week to keep us on our toes before this final barrage. So I decided I would stay up all night studing and tell my mother that I would like to stay home today, because my teachers are only handing out classwork and I would like to stay home to be ready for the work on Friday- and of course, she said no. I'm kinda known for getting what I want in unconventional ways like a spoiled brat, so for the past 5 hours I've been studying in this bathroom accompanied by various smells and nasty ass dudes who didn't even wash his hands or flush- Yea! Shout out to you, David! Flushed two times already for ya buddy!.. At this point, I'm just wondering if it was worth it. I have 2 more hours left on my journey and 52% left of battery. (My notes are on my phone) Irony seems to follow wherever I go and I can help but laugh at my words from last night "You'll probably regret this in the future."

This, Is something I have really wanted to share for a long time. And since people tend to share there stories on here .. these are mine. It's about two things that happened when I was growing up. These events are not as serious as what's going on in our time now, but they affected me. And I mean a lot. All while I was growing up, and it still does now. So this is my first story. When I was 8 years old, I had a very wonderful Christmas day. The parent's got me everything I wanted. CD player with some CD's, air-soft gun, underwear, the classic middle class Christmas. I'm very fortunate for that. So, as I was laying in my bed, listening to my music and just about to go to sleep, I hear a very very loud bang. I instantly get chills and freeze up. Then, (dj khaled) another one. I jumped out of bed and started to run to the kitchen. My mom walks out of her room and asks what that bang was. I shrugged and ran to the kitchen window. I saw my father standing outside with a cigarette in his mouth. (he was just going out for a smoke while letting my dogs out) I hear him say "HEY, GET OVER HERE", he was calling for our dogs to come to the garage. My heart is pounding, my mind is racing, I'm thinking my dad is hurt, I can't see them and I think my dogs are hurt, my dad might of hurt someone. So here I am, 8 years old, in my pitch black kitchen with a see through air-soft, glow in the dark BB's, shaking like a pussy. My dad finally walks in and tells my mom to call the police. We both ask what is going on, and he said he was out smoking, then heard a gun shot a couple feet to the left of him. He saw four dark figures standing next to our fence, and another shot went off. We look out and see them making there way across the street. Which conveniently, is an open field. We watch them for a minute until they all seemed to leave the area, or at least out of our view. My mom is telling the operator all of this while my dad was coming back from getting his shotgun. A few minutes pass as we waited and looked out the windows. I was scouting the yard, and suddenly I noticed someone crouching in our bushes. I freaked out and started yelling that someone was there. I think they must of heard me, cause they started to move towards the ditch and across our yard. All of a sudden, a car comes from down the street and picks up this person. As it is about to turn off our street, the cops turn down our street and into our driveway. My dad goes outside and swiftly tells them what happened and that they JUST passed the people who were in our yard. The cops pull out and take off down the road. Later we see a car that looks like the one that picked up the person fly down our road with the cop car after it. Turns out it was just someone down our road who had a similar vehicle to the one that they saw when pulling down our street. And like that, the people got away. Police searched our yard with flashlights and found two shells near where my dad said they were standing. Both were buckshot's. We are not sure why they were on our property,  we thought that they might of been some drunk teen's causing trouble, and misfired on accident. Or the worst things that came to my mind, that they were shooting at my dad or at the dogs. It was a very strange moment for me. That however was not as bad as this next event. This story has to do with a friend of my sister who lives a three houses down from us. Her name was Kate. She was a really cool person. Amazing soccer player, always so nice to everyone, and would never hurt a fly.  So, fast forward to my twelfth birthday. About a month before it, my parents adopted a relative of my aunts friend who was going through a rough time. His name was Josh, and he was my age. I don't know why they did that, but I was told it was because I was a very distant from people, a very shy kid, and my mom thought a brother would help in some way. He ended up leaving after about half a year, but that's a whole different story. When he moved into our house, he brought a PlayStation 2. I was excited because I was young, I loved video games, and I thought he was cool just for having one. After a few days he finally let me play it. I saw that he had Grand Theft Auto Vice City and I started to play it. This, was the time where seeing cops heads get blown off and spraying crowds of people with machine guns started to infect my mind. That virus of terror you can cause whenever on a simulation of our world had begun to spread in my little head. Poor guy... Oh, back to the story. After I got his GTA taken away by showing my mom how good I was at sniping the cops head off, It was time for bed. Josh was pissed I got the PlayStation taken away. But I didn't really care. I was young. Just like the story before, I am lying in bed trying to get some sleep. I was almost there too, starting to develop a dream. And then, I started hearing distant gunshots. (I literally just started tearing up reliving this in my head) I started hearing screams. And, I can see in my head a scenario of GTA. Like I am playing the game. Just gunshots, and screaming, people running away. It was kinda fucking with me. So I opened my eyes, and I could still hear it. After a few seconds, I heard a huge bang followed by a petrifying scream in the distance that slowly got louder. I shot out of bed with fear in every inch of my body, and I bolt to my parents room. I tell them I was hearing loud bangs and people screaming. My parents said they heard a bang too, but just one. She goes on about the game and that it was causing me to have a nightmare. I was convinced and I go back to my room. Josh looks down from the top bunk and asks why I ran out of the room so fast. I told him what happened and he said he didn't hear anything, due to him having headphones on. It took a while but i was finally able to fall asleep. The next morning, I wake up and go to my computer. Start playing some online games and just finding stuff to do. I look out the window and and see Kate coming around the fence and up to our door. I get up and open it and greet her. She asks if my sister is home. I said yeah she's in her room but I think she is still asleep. She said she needs to talk to her and walks past me and goes to her room. My mom asks me whats going on and I told her I wasn't sure. About 3 minutes pass and we start hearing Kate cry very loud. She was trying to speak, but couldn't catch her breath and was choking on her words. A few more minutes pass and she comes out. Face was red as you can tell she was crying. She apologizes to my parents and says her goodbye's. My sister came out of her room with tears in her eyes. We all ask her what is wrong. She comes to the couch and says that Kate's dad got into a fight with her mom, and snapped. He grabbed a gun and chased them both around the house. He shot her mom in the leg and hip and she fell down the basement stairs. After Kate was fast enough to get out of the house, the dad walked outside in the backyard with a shotgun and shot himself in the head. She was right at the corner of the house watching when he did it, and she started screaming. I then realize after she tells us all of this.. That I was hearing those gunshots, I was hearing her screams. I was .. I was terrified. I had the biggest chill go down my spine. I told my parents about it and they looked spooked. After that, things were never the same. Kate and her brother had to move in with with a close relative of theirs. My sister kept updates for me though, unfortunately they weren't the best. and told me that she began to heavily drink and get into drugs. I cannot blame her, witnessing something like that would make you need a numbing solution. I hear she turned herself around though. Moved to California and got in a pro soccer league. If you read through this, thank you for taking the time. These are just a few things that keep reoccurring in my dreams and my thoughts. Even just seeing a commercial for GTA will trigger this flashback.

Sorry for the last part being a wall of text. I haven't been on reddit for a while and I forgot you have to put two spaces.Alright here we go.So, Lord Max has become student president and we're doing well. We didn't realize how much work it was going to take to maintain our position. We were going to have to hire people. Luckily as a class president our nerdiness went down slightly and we were able to recruit something like five new Maxicans.Our five new Maxicans were there to help make propaganda posters and to get new Maxicans. As for the four of us who had followed Max since the beginning were now called the Maxican Elite Guard. That night we had a meeting that would forever change the reason for the Maxican republic, and the reason for the republic of Maxico. We talked about how we can do better than our principle. She was an actual tard and a cheese stick could have done a better job. We hated her because she (for the most part) let the jocks do what ever the fuck they wanted.We were going to put a stop to it.The meeting went something like this."We shouldn't pull pranks any more. I mean Spaghetti got his fucking nose punched in so we could pull some stupid ass pranks? NEIN! Remember in middle school when we complained about class presidents doing absolutely nothing, and they wouldn't listen to our complaints. They wouldn't do anything for us. They went to meetings so they could spread the schools propaganda. (Our middle school constantly was parading about how good our school was and telling lies to scare us from breaking rules.) We must rid the school of propaganda, we must rid the school of oppression of nerds, and we must make the school better!"The Elite guard erupted with "HAIL LORD MAX!"The next day at school. Our other Maxicans recruited two new Maxicans. They seemed faithful enough but we didn't give them much info just assignments. We gave them some pointless busywork to make them feel like they were doing something. As student president we had access to the announcement system. Hell yes. When the stupid principle finishes her announcements we make our own.Sorry for this being short. I have to go to work and shit. If you want to see part 3 comment.

I was 13 in the summer of 2009, I was dating this girl for about two weeks. Now before I go on and tell this story keep in mind, I had no fucking clue what sex or anything in that nature was. I was in a christian school my preteen years and they never discussed anything about sex, dicks, vaginas, or how kids were made. So anyway I'm at friends house, and I get a text from my girlfriend saying those three words "I love you" now me being me a naive 13 year old I said "I love you too"  and as soon as I said that she calls me saying "let's make love" now like I said before I had NO fucking idea what any of that stuff meant, I honestly thought she was talking about marrying me, and again my naive ass agrees to it. It worked out perfect though my friend lived two blocks over from her so she agrees on meeting me at night, so around 10 pm I see her, and I'm so excited because I think I'm fixing to marry her and have an awesome life together, but oh no. She looks at me and says "where are we going to do it?" I'm looking around and spot this abandoned house. 'Tries to open doors but the are locked'Im starting to give up so I'm like fuck it we'll just get married on the side of the abandoned house. So as I'm standing right beside the ac unit waiting for her to say her vowels, she goes down on her knees, unzipping my pants, and sucking my cock. By now I'm freaking out sorta crying because it feels good, and I'm really scared. After 5 minutes she looks at me and says "are you ready to make love?" By now I don't give two shits about marrying her I just want to leave and go home to my mom, she takes off her pants and gets on top of me and rides me like I'm a fucking bull; not even 2 minutes in I cum and as soon as I cum I run straight fucking home. Now that's 5 miles away and I get there in 20 minutes. As soon as I got home I ran to my room crying/ traumatized thinking what the fuck did I just do. The next day I told my mom, and she pulls me from the private school and puts me in public school. Thanks to my ex I can never have sex without crying. That's my story of how I lost my virginity.

I'm so freaking pissed !!!!!!!! I left my house to go to a nearby shop to pick up a few things. When I got back home, there was 3 police cars  outside and  4 police officers in my house. The front door had been knocked off the hinges, stuff was everywhere, and apparently they were looking for something. So I'm stuck outside with this police officer and they are inside searching through everything, even my washing machine. They checked inside my cupboards, under my mattress. They tore my things apart. So, as you can imagine, I'm getting quite annoyed, and I'm trying figure out what's going on. I asked if they had a search warrant, and if I could see it. The cop in my living room yells, "Where did you hide it? We know it's here! We will search till we find it."Then I yell back, "If I had an idea of what you're looking for,, maybe I could help!" He shoots me the "you wanna go to jail?" look, so I shut up and watch one of the other police officers look down at his phone.Then other officer shouts, "Guys Stop! Hold on. We're in the wrong house! The Pok�mon is next door!"

This is a true story that has been ongoing for years. The last of the aftermath was cleared up not long ago, and I kinda feel the need to tell this story, because it's a monster. My name is Daniel. I'm a 25-year-old college student living in a south-eastern city making $10/hour at a coffee shop on campus. A few years ago, I met this guy Jason. He and I hit it off great, I mean spectacularly. We argued for hours over shit we agreed on, played league of legends for 30+ hours straight on weekends, hung out constantly. I loved this dude, okay? No, really. I adored him. He was beautiful, smart, a great person, had actual attainable goals, a plan for his life, and his eyes were like sapphires glittering in the sun. (Did i mention he is fucking beautiful?)I was head over heels. And obviously, because the universe could never possibly be fair, he had a girlfriend. Nicole was a nice chick, not my type, but not bad looking. A bit strange, but whatever. I didn't resent her for being with Jason. Not everyone's gay, and even if they were, not everyone would return my feelings. I didn't mind. I was happy to let my crush burn itself out in time.She wasn't. I wasnt openly bisexual, so no clue how she knew, I guess she picked up the signs, or another friend told her or something, because that chick turned bitchmode in a fuckin second. She would glare at me when Jason brought her to the shop to visit while I was at work, force Jason to go offline or watch Netflix or anything but play games. If there was a party I'd be at she wanted to stay home. It was pretty stupid. Well, Halloween of 2014 rolls along, we get invited to a "party" at this guys trailer, dude I knew from high school that sold Jason's brother weed (small world, eh?) So we were both pretty stoked to hang out with this guy. Nicole tries her normal bullshit but Jason was totally in for it. Halloween comes, we go over, drink. Listen to music. Few hours later, tons of people are passed out, some craply non-history history channel sjow is playing. This fat chick and one of the guys there head out to our gracious hosts van and get it on (we later heard he was not a satisfying lay) and very few people are left awake, Myself, Nicole and Jason included. Jason and this long haired guy decide to go to the neighbors and borrow an air mattress (guess they had pass outs a lot) so it's just me and Nicole alone with a dozon drunken bodies lying on various surfaces. She curtly asks if I want to go smoke a joint, and while I'm not usually one to partake, but I figure maybe she wanted to talk and I could get her to hate me less, I guess. We step out on the back porch, and theres one of those porch swing things there. As soon as the door closes, she grabs me and starts pulling me down onto the swing, trying to rip off my pants. I freak the fuck out, like absolute FLIP A SHIT. She starts screaming and runs inside. I'm sitting on a porch swing with my pants half on, thinking what the fuck is this bitch doing?A few seconds later, my buddy Mike leads a charge if half the drunken corpses from the house, and a very scared and torn up looking Nicole between them all. Mike decks me, knocks me off the swing and starts wailing on me. Jason heard the commotion I guess and he comes running up at that time, rips Mike off me. Some other guy grabs Jason and holds him back off Mike. He's screaming at the guy asking what he was doing hitting me, and Mike screams "well your great ass friend Danny just raped your fucking girlfriend"Jason just stared at him for a second, and turns to me, looks at Nicole, and back to me. I swear to got the next few seconds were in slow motion. Jason grabs me by the neck and lifts me up onto the porch rail, and kicks me so hard in the crotch I fall over the rail and onto the grass below. There was a lot of yelling and screaming, the cops show up and take me away in handcuffs. They get her story.I was told she accused me of rape. Obviously, I guess. Now, false rape accusations happen. But as we all know, cops usually take the chicks side. So I ask one question:Did she say I stuck my dick inside her.Well, no fuckin shit. Yeah. I bust out laughing. The cop asks what I find funny about sexually assaulting a young girl. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I was born the former. I am a transgender male, I was born with a vagina but started on testosterone at 15 and have fully transitioned. I've had surgery to remove my breasts but none on my lower parts. My crotch area is still, for the most part, a normal female body. No penis. Long story short, skipping a ton of legal bullshit and examinations and proving of identity, Jason and I are still best friends, he's still straight as an arrow, I'm not a rapist, and Nicole has no friends whatsoever (and no boyfriend.)I also met a nice gay guy, and he's our jungler now. He always ganks me first <3

Well, this was a really awkward moment right a few minutes ago. I got pretty hungry and decided to pick something to eat.My girlfriend lives on her own floor and don't have any bowls or pots up here for my instant ramen so I had to go to her parents floor which is no problem for 9pm.Because I think its retarded to eat so late, I waited for them to take their dogs for a walk so I could steal a bowl to make my food on our own floor.well fuck, when I opened the door without knocking (I'm fucking sorry for that and will never forget it again) I opened the door. I went in and saw her mother pretty near naked changing clothes. She started talking because she thought I'm my girlfriends father so I tried to make her realize its me.I faced the door, trying not to look at her, while I answered a question of her with "haha, I don't know" in hope she would realize its me. Well she didn't and continued dealing with her business. But when I turned around to walk into the kitchen, she was still standing there but now watching me, while I looked into her eyes... woops.We both started to apologize and I got so embarassed. I stayed in the kitchen until she got out of her room and I apologized for what I saw and that I didn't knocked on the door.Its not a hard or big story but it was sooooooo awkward. Now I'm sitting here, eating my ramen and sharing this story with you folks, cringing inside of my guts.good night guys!

Dear Mom and Dad,I don�t really know how to put this� I feel like I only have two options right now, end it all or get out of here. I wake up every day to the same god damn thing, same asshole friends, same piece of shit school. It just gets very hard to go on. I want to see world, explore, meet new people, the same old clich� bull shit you watch and read everywhere. Anyways I formally address this to you guys to tell you guys not to look for me, for you will not find me. By now I�m probably long gone. I�m not sure where I�m headed, but I saved up $500 for food and all that jazz, I�ll be fine trust me. Someday I will probably come back to visit, but I don�t know when. It�s not your guy�s fault; I�m just really fucked up. I bid you goodbye for now, but not forever.Love,Your SonI never really planned for this to happen okay. It�s all my friend Adam�s fault, the asshole killed himself, leaving me if this god damn world all alone. It really fucked with me, I mean sure I had other friends but their just a bunch of dicks who treat me like shit, like I�m an idiot, which I�m not. I had it all going for me, perfect 3.5 GPA, Colleges already in mind, and the hottest god damn chicks in the country! My life was fucking perfect. But then Adam killed himself, no one knows why. After that I had a decision to make, wake up every day, doing the same exact god damn thing, or get the fuck out of here and really do something. I always had a thing for traveling, seeing the world, meeting new people, it really appealed to me. So I decided to leave� And that�s what I did, I just left. Just like that.	As I left my house I took one final look. It really was a nice place, everyone loved me in there. But I just had to seek out places where the grass was greener, and with 500 bucks and a backpack with three books, a carton of cigarettes, and a lighter I walked away. 	Walking I thought about where I would go, maybe Texas. I always loved the idea of Austin, Texas. Did you know girls can walk anywhere without a shirt on in Austin, tits and everything. So in another impulsive decision I decided on Austin.I was on the side of Freeway 35when I was finally picked up by some jackass in a ford F-150. The biggest fucking truck on the planet, it pretty much took up two lanes.�Where you headed?� The trucker said in a deep southern voice. �Texas, Austin to be exact� �I�m heading to Pueblo, you want to hop in I can take you as far as there.� I hopped in the F-150 the whole thing smelt like Pabst Blue Ribbon and cigarettes, and some other smell I couldn�t make out at the moment.�So Texas huh, how old are you anyway?� His breath reeked of Marlboro. �23, and yeah Texas always wanted to see it.� That was a complete lie not only was I 16, but I had only decided to see Texas about half an hour ago. �Awesome do you have family in Texas or something� �No, just want to see it��It was a painful conversation, why would you want to talk to someone whom you picked up on the side of the road. To counter I took one of the books out of my backpack. The Alchemist, I always loved this one; it�s about a shepherd who leaves his job to chase treasure In Egypt.  I quickly fell asleep after our conversation ended.�Hey wake up, wake up� He said, shaking me awake. �Yeah?� I said still half asleep. �I�m going in for a drink, want to join?� �Oh, yeah sure� We got out of his car and headed into some dive bar about 20 miles outside of pueblo. As we approach the bar I see two people to the left in a vicious argument about god knows what, I didn�t pay much attention to it. �I�ll take a PBR on tap please� He said to the bartender. �And you?� The bartender asked me �Oh, I�ll take a cognac� �Can I see you�re ID please� He asked me �I left it at home� I said See the trick is to always be confident, if you seem worried they won�t give in, but if you can convince yourself that you�re legal, you can convince anyone. �Never mind, it�s just a formality. I�ll have those rights out.�I looked again at the guys on the left side of the bar, they were still arguing, and one guy started to look pissed.My drink arrived, and it was pretty strong, I felt a little drunk after drinking most of it. Just then as I take another sip on my cognac, I hear a gun shot. I look to the left and I see one of the guys drop out of his stool and fall onto the ground. The other one runs out the door and into his Lincoln Continental.People are screaming and the bartenders on the phone with the cops. �We better go� My ride said. I thought the same thing since I wanted no business with the cops.I got back in the car, the thought of what I had just witnessed lingered in my head. The first person I had ever seen die� The first always sticks with you.I had woken up just after sun rise. �How far away are we?� I asked my driver �Two miles out, so where do you plan on going after this? I mean how you plan on getting to Texas.� �I don�t know, maybe I�ll hitch a ride with another kind stranger, or maybe I�ll jump on a train, for all I care I can fucking walk there. As long as I know I�ll be there eventually, I�ll be happy.� �Okay, just don�t get killed, people are fucked up, and you just witnessed that first hand.� 	We arrived at Pueblo. The place was so god damn hot and dry I couldn�t figure out why anyone in their right mind would want to be there.�Be safe now� The driver said.�Okay I will. Thank you for all you�ve done.�	We then parted ways, I walked one way he walked another. My next stop was Trinidad, right on the border of Colorado and New Mexico. So I just started walking, and I swear to god I walked about ten hours that day.	The sun finally began to set, I decided to stay in Colorado City, �The shittiest city on planet earth�. I�m not exaggerating when I say that, it really sucks dick.	I found a shitty motel that only cost six bucks an hour so I decided to stay there until 5 the next morning, being that it was 12 o�clock I would only end up paying 40 bucks. Right once I got up to my room it smelt like pure shit and cigarettes. Dear god even if I was a prostitute I would not let someone take me here. I decided to take my chances on the floor, seeing that the bed was covered in semen.I lie down on the floor and turn on the TV. Pulp Fiction is on, oh how I loved this movie, well I loved all movies, but this one especially. I always dreamed of making movies, or at least be involved in making movies. Recalling my day, I slowly drift off to sleep.	Waking up to the sound of bed springs above me I quickly realize that it�s already 12 o�clock and I have overstayed my welcome. Naturally of course I crawl out the back window to avoid paying my fee.My next stop was Walsenburg, and considering it was ten hours away I decided I better high tail it, or catch a ride. The odds of both were slim.After about an hour of walking alongside the road with my thumb out like a complete idiot, someone finally decided to have the decency to pick me up.�Howdy, where you headed� He said in the most annoying country accent I had ever heard.�Austin Texas��I�m headed to Trinidad, it�s about 60 miles down road, hop in if you�d like�This was perfect, not only was it double the distance but it would only take about an hour compared to the 20 it would take me to walk.�Yeah that�s perfect� I said while hopping in his warn down Jeep Cherokee, once again I could not get over the smell of piss and cigarettes, I was almost getting accustomed to it from being in Colorado City so long.About 30 minutes passed before he wanted to start a conversation�So what brings you around these parts?��I don�t know, just traveling I guess�� I said as I pulled the alchemist out of my backpack.�Any particular reason you�re traveling?��Nope, just want to travel�� I said, while still trying to read.�Are you a runaway son?��No, I�m actually 23 thank you very much�� My eyes peered of my book and onto the road, which is when I saw a deer speeding across the highway��Watch ou�.� We slammed into the deer at a full 60 miles an hour, crushing the car and causing us to spin out of control; we slid into a ditch on the side of the road stopping our car.I wake up in a dizzy haze. As I try to orient myself I see my driver, with blood dripping down his entire body, stay motionless in the driver seat. I quickly get out of the car and sit down on the ground next to the car. Number two� Number two is a little less clear as number one, but you will always remember bits and pieces. The sound of police sirens echoed throughout the valley, I decided it was better for me to leave then deal with them, so I walked, and damn did I walk fast.About three hours later I finally arrived at Trinidad Colorado.�Halfway there, I�ll be in Texas before I fucking know it.�I walked to the park that laid to the left of Trinidad, that�s where I decided to sleep that night. Damn was I hungry. I decided to stop at the burger joint across from the park.�Hey, can I just get a cheese burger and a large Dr. Pepper��Yeah, that�ll be $3.50�I went in my wallet to pull out the necessary cash, which must of sparked the interest of the guys behind me because they all began talking.I quickly finished my burger still a little uneasy about the guys behind me. As I walked back to the park someone addressed me.�Hey! Amigo�I turned around to see who it was, and who other than the ass holes at the burger shop.�Hey, what�s going on?� I said, sounding quite confused.�You got plenty of money there. Mind sharing it?� He said in stupid high pitched Mexican accent.�Good one.� I turned around trying to ignore them.�I aint fucking kidding amigo, you either hand it over, or we take it.� A couple other thugs came out from the alley next to the shop.��Listen, I aint giving you shit. So I would suggest you, and all of your good for nothing thugs back there, back the fuck off before I have to do something rash.�Just then the asshole pulls out an Italian stiletto, seven inches.�The fuck you say amigo? I have half a mind to slit your throat and take that money by force.�He started inching closer switchblade in hand. I came up with a plan, if he comes any closer I�ll give him a swift kick to the chest and grab the knife while he�s on the ground, and as for his friends, I�ll deal with them when I have too.�Now listen, I aint asking anymore, no hand the fucking wallet over��He inched even closer now within my range.�No.�I kicked him dead on in the chest but the bastard was able to stab my leg. He dropped the knife on the curb so I quickly went to grab it; I picked it up and jumped back to my feet.�Now listen, if any of you fuckers come any fucking closer I�ll put this knife in your fucking sternum.�The ass hole on the ground tried to get a punch off, which is when I drove the knife right into his gut, causing him to fall to the ground covered in blood.	Number three� Number three is usually blurry, but my number three just happened to be my number one as well. The first kill, this one stays with you forever. Every night in your dreams you see the face of the first one. You imagine his soul leaving his body as you drive the knife deeper and deeper.I had no other option but to run, and apparently his buddies were a little bitter that I had just stabbed their friends so they came after me, with guns� The bullets skimmed the ground next to me but they couldn�t hit me, I felt invincible. I felt as if I knew I was going to die, but I was not going to die now.	I ran into a meadow surround by trees, I would be safe there. I lay down under an old oak tree. As I close my eyes the face of my latest victim plagued my mind. I could not sleep. The entire night, I reenacted the thrusting of my blade in his chest.	I began moving at 5:00 A.M. I needed to hitch a ride, I was so damn tired I could barely stand. I held my thumb out on the side of the road. Every time I closed my eyes. I see� His eyes. They plague my memories. A BMW begins to slow down.�Hey, where you headed?� He asked me.�Austin Texas��Well lucky for you so am I, hop in I�ll give you a ride.�I took a seat in the BMW, it was the comfiest car I had been in yet, much more comfortable than the damn tree. And for the first time in a while, I got some sleep, and damn did I sleep great.It was only a ten hour drive and I slept for the whole fucking ride.�Hey� Wake up� He said, nudging me awake�Huh? Yeah what�s up?�We�re almost there; do you have any particular place you need to be?��Oh, no anywhere will do�He pulled up to a corner on 25th street�Thank you so much man.��No problem, hey be safe.� He drove away, and here I was. Austin Texas. It was all over, the journey, the reason I left in the first place. Over. I walked outside of a convenience store and sat down on the curb. I could not figure out why I came here in the first place. Why I left in the first place! For the first time I missed home. I thought of my mother and father mourning over me, wondering when I�ll be home. It hurt me to think about it.	I went into the convenience store and picked up a notepad and pen. My journey was over, and I knew it. I wasn�t meant to live. I took a seat in the back alley on a cinder block and took out the pad and pen. I scribbled a few thoughts and sat it down next to me. My hand went into my backpack and grabbed the pack of cigarettes I had in there. I placed one in my mouth and lit it. This was the first cigarette I ever smoked, they were Adams, and I always just hung onto them, I don�t know why but I did. 	I sat there and just thought, and I thought for a while. I put out the last cigarette in the pack. As I sat down I grabbed the switchblade in my pocket. It flicked open, raised the blade to my throat, and thought my last thought.Dear Mom, Dad & FriendsThis will be my last letter for I have completed my journey. I was just not made for this world, I was meant for bigger things that I am unable to achieve in this lifetime. Do not feel pity for me, I have done this myself, I have made the choice. No matter what, I love you and I always will. I am just too good for this world. I do not understand how people can live there life the way we all do, the same god damn thing every day. We are not meant to hate our lives for the �wellbeing� of ourselves. We were put on this earth to do something great, and I already have. We are travelers, nomads of an astral plane. Our energy lives on, but you cannot retry your life. You must live in the Now, not in the future. You must not over analyze things, if it seems right, do it. Live your life how you want to. Not how you think you should.Love,Alex.
